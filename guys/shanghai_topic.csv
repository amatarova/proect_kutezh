1,"being vegetarian in shanghai china is a donting task for lunch and dinner
efes is a best place to be in
very well decorated and easy to locate

delicious food fabulous verity in menu
friendly atmosphere you will get very good care
thank you efes sanjay singh india, good food i really enjoyedthe manager was really friendly worth the money you spend out of the few turkish options in shangai they are the vest, if you are at shanghai definitely you must go to efes restaurant foods are also perfect but their hospitality makes you feel at turkey so thanks alot to mr ramazan for his kindly welcome, i really really enjoyed the dinner hereas well as my friendsand we aready have another plan to have dinner there, i really enjoyed the dinner in this restaurant there are many choices in the menu the food was delicious the restaurant manager ramazan and his assistant isa was really kind like a friend if i come back to shanghai again i will definitely come back to efes restaurant i visited many mediterranean restaurants but efes is the best, we were so excited to try efes and were certainly satisfied we started with a cold appetizer that included bread and a number of dips  hummus eggplant yogurt etc i had the cheese pita with tomatoes and my friends had salmon and warm grape leaves the environment was pleasing and the ownermanager ramazan was an excellent host and proprietor he was quick to assist and always willing to chat i highly recommend efes and will definitely visit again next time i am in shanghai, im turkish so i have an idea whats authentic and whats not we decided to come here with another turkish friend and ordered a meze platter turkish pizza lahmacun and a mixed kebab grill the restaurant manager ramazan is a lovely outgoing host and he made sure every guest was enjoying their dinner in a sincere way their mixed grill plate is super huge and every single piece of meat and kebab tasted fresh and delicious i only wish they had better hummus and maybe more ambient turkish music but thats ok stuffed vine leaves tasted great they do have a decent global wine list ranging from chilean to french in addition to turkish ones but we just opted for a glass of the house wine which was a chilean cabernet sauvignon if you really want the turkish experience dont forget to ask the tea or turkish coffee to finish your dinner, halal and deliuciuce food in shanghai very good staff and service i return agine to that resturant asuggest to that for and muslim in shanghai china thank u staf, one of the best meals i have had in shanghai great atmosphere and the best attention by our host manager ramazan recommended, i am a huge fane of efes restaurant as not only me but all the people who i have invited on dinner at this place ie turkish italians chinese french british and american friends all of them loved the food undoubtedly not even once i got complained or embarrassed due to any reason from efes restaurant unlike other turkish restaurants in shanghai i can say that as i have tried all of them today is the first day i have decided to go for home delivery just to check quality of food but once again as usual food was perfect beautifully marinated and cooked adana one of my favorite in this restaurant perfectly bbqed chicken shish tawuk gavurdagi salad and my favorite haydayri yoghurt dip amazing and delicious  just perfect no other words keep it up guys you really deserve all the praises  as maintaining throughout consistency and delivering good quality food tells a lot about you guys 2 thumbs up , im really picky when it comes to turkish food mums food is best but efes has done exceptionally well to preserve traditional turkish flavours with fresh local ingredients ill be back with friends during my time here, the food was goodnot out of this world nor unpalatable the salad was a little too sweet pomegranate juice and vinegar dressing the bread was good the appetizer sampler was half good and half forgettable my steak came out nicely but there was nothing to be done but grill it no special marinades or spices my husband had the kebob combination which came with two different kebobs and some meatballs on a bed of croutons under a thick sauce some good some forgettable the turkish coffee was not good and that was surprising since i at least thought that would be the one item to shine not to be the trend continued to the end with the desserts my husbands rice pudding was tasty but my fried ice cream was pretty average the only remarkable thing about the food was its consistencyhalf good half forgettable the saving grace was the service which was excellent unfortunately excellent service can not overcome average food, the atmosphere is very nice and the staff was also very nice however as someone who is from toronto and lives in shanghai for the past 5 years i dont think as a tourist you should be coming here to eat when you want to visit china there are so many chinese cuisines to try including that of xinjiang which has a middle eastern influence and really shouldnt belong under the category of chinese food the food was good but i do not think it was worth the price as it was quite expensive and i have been to other middle eastern restaurants and they are just as good in my opinion can be found near the french concession i would rather recommend the many xinjiang restaurants that are located in shanghai as you will never get to eat this cuisine elsewhere whereas a turkish restaurant can often be found in other countries as well

in short its good but not for the price, good selection of food with vegetarian and vegan options very nice staff food is tasty and well presented and the place is clean and comfortable it will be on my regular restaurant rotation in shanghai also its convenient to two subway lines, we were greeted by ramzaan who seated us and gave us some recommendations best lentil soup i have had anywhere and was truly zesty and mouth watering the bbq came on a nice big platter great presentation and food will definitely visit again when in shanghai, if you are looking for genuine turkish cuisine efes is a great place to try it their grilled food is amazing  you have a turkish chef and good service, it was very good food and service har to find but worth the trouble finding it not expensive, my wife and me like to eat there when we have enough from asian food and like to have another taste the restaurant is very nice and the food and service very good we never leave before all our plate are empty clear it`s high level kitchen and this you have to pay but for us price for shanghai is okay, my family and i had the pleasure of visiting this wonderful restaurant on new years eve the service is impeccable ramazan the manager was a perfect host suggesting some great mealswe thoroughly enjoyed our night  i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants wonderfully fresh food presented beautifully next time i return from australia to shanghai i will definitely be back to dine at efes, if you are in shanghai for couple days and get sick of the chinese food  eves restaurant is a great choice to taste some finest turkish food  i have eaten in istanbul and i would say there food was way better then the foods in istanbul, went for a sunday lunch treat i was craving for a adana kebab i got some humus with both very delicious the owner took good care and offered me a turkish coffee by the end of my meal ill be back soon, this restaurant is fancier than i expected it to be but there were both tables of families groups of friends and couples inside this is a very nice place to go for a nice dinner when you grow tired of chinese food which inevitablywill happen service was very good food was authentic perhaps a little bit expensive but i think worth it overall the experience was very nice their house wine was good so imagine the other wine selections would be good as well, friendly staff great food and the place was run by real turkish people the food was worth what we paid for, been to three turkish restaurants in china this one is different high quality food and it is halal
for starter i had lentil soap and lahmacun  minced beef with vegetables paste over thin crust dough  both were amazing for main course i had iskender kebab and you have to try it i would like to thank the manager ramazan for the amazing hospitality, looking for authentic turkish food well served and friendly service in a nice ambience this is the place to go the owner runs his own restaurant and will make you feel welcome the menu is extensive and delicious the wine list covers all wishes dont make the mistake to fill yourself up on the excellent entries you will not have enough room left for the next dish that will come, food was good service was fine but not the best is it male dominant environment and it feels that men look down on women
its a good choice for those living and traveling on pudong side far away from puxi
location is not the best just opposite a gym and entrance quite shaggy eating opposite a gym it makes you think of your weight control rather than the delicious turkish food and deserts
there are better options in town, we went there 2adults and 2kids and enjoyed a mix kebab for 34persons the meat was just great i havent seen my 4year old eating like this for months all enjoyed it the atmosphere is nice and price is ok for shanghai approx 700rmb for the 4 of us we will go back again, i had lunch at efes with my girlfriend and was amazed by the food probably the best turkish restaurant in shanghai we took various appetizers with main dishes to share and everything we had was simply delicious having travelled to turkey several times i didnt expect a restaurant to come up with such an authentic taste in shanghai efes managed to respect the authenticity of turkish food while bringing other mediterranean dishes on board and its a very nice match ill definitely go back there again, me and my friend went to visit this restaurant after a friends suggestion the moment we entered the restaurant manager ramazan came to welcome us and escorted us to a nice window table the food was incredible the meat and bread were super delicious and the service always attentive we will go back to this restaurant as soonest strongly suggest to all who wants try some really good turkish cuisine thank you, traveling alone from the us with no chinese language or culture experience was a bit overwhelming to me however i felt extremely comfortable and taken care of here everyone spoke excellent english and was very attentive in a western experience fashion i enjoyed my food very much and was pleased they accepted credit cards it took me a moment to find as i was completely unfamiliar with the area and was relying on google maps for directions aside from that i would highly recommend this place, this restaurant is always good for two reasons 1 the food prepared well and attention to detail is always there 2 the staff genuinely cares about their guests and will do anything to make you have a good experience this was a work dinner i arranged and highly recommend it for all occasions, excellent restaurant i was really enjoyed a relaxed business lunch there after few weeks in china was so good to have again a taste of mediterranean cuisine, brilliant dining experience a few days ago the food was fantastic and the service was first class the platters are great value for money but everything we tried was great definitely worth a visit and will be back soon, food was ok  mezes were average  main dishes were ok lahmacun was the best  coming from turkey myself i thought food was overalll average  service was good , we visited efes on sunday for lunch and we were surprised that was almost empty good service as well as fast great food choice  love to come back, so whenever i visit shanghai i do have a meal here they have really good options the lentil soup babaganoush etc please reserve a meal here, we stumbled on to this lunch spot and are still in awe of the fabulous dishes the wine list looked good but we stuck to the amazing food and are so happy with everything we tried the muhamnara is such a richly unique dish i have eaten many dishes of hummus in my life and i had intended to try it here the muhamnara is my new favorite food the bread came fresh from the oven with 3 delicious dipping sauces yogurtlu ali pasa kebab<u+0131> ali pasha kebab with yoghurt sauce was a hit it will be hard to decide on our next visit try something new or enjoy the richness of these two lovely plates, the welcoming began before we entered the door
the manager ramazan instantly welcomed us in the interior is great and just good vibes when we entered the building we had ezogelin soup to begin which was brilliant we then had mixed kebab and haydari turkish food at its best the staff were superb the quality of the service and food cannot be faulted we visited efes as it was number 1 on trip advisor and we were right to visit ramazan is excellent and realy knows how to treat his customers thank you ramazan  his staff for this great experience, had some free time and saw that a number 1 restaurant in shanghai according to tripadvisor is only a few minutes away from the hotel great food superb service and friendly atmosphere we were able to get a table for three around 730 pm without a reservation but soon realized that we were lucky as the place filled up highly recommend, unfortunately removed my recently posted 5 star review after both my wife and i suffered a full night and day of food poisoning after eating here last night the food tasted excellent and service was good i ordered the lamb kebab and my wife the adana kebab we had turkish pizza and hummus as appetizers i had a bite of her kebab and she had a bite of mine we loved it until the aftermath

she suffered the worst of the food poisoning and was locked away in the hotel room with non stop

 nausea
 vomiting
 liquid diarrhea
 brutal abdominal pain and cramps
 broken blood vessels around eyes from getting sick all night

i had diarrhea uneasiness and some abdominal pain i suspect the adana kebab was the culprit and not prepared properly the only other thing she had more of was the spicy dipping sauce for the bread which i sampled fortunately it appears to be a less than 24 hour bout but time will tell would like to at least have one day to explore shanghai tomorrow without being trapped in the room going home a few pounds lighter, arrived greeted as you would expect
2 minutes after being seated was quickly told corkage fee was 200 rnb
thats $40 australian you have got to be kidding that was the start of the shock food was brought
waiting for the bread asked three times for it
food was average at best as i dont go to shanghai often i dont believe i will return to efes
this was probably the least liked restaurant i have been to around the world, i could not believe i can find such delicious food in shanghai
really enjoyed from food quality environment lovely staff  good service
food materials were perfect  fresh environment design is very nice  staff are friendly  helpful to my surprize they can speak good english turkish chinese
price is very high but fare compare to quality
let them choose for you what is best of food there or you may choose from variety of their menu, who expects to find a turkish restaurant in shanghai we didnt but the high rating in tripadvisor was too inviting not to try we were not disappointed all elements food ambiance and service received an a from both my wife and myself she being a vegetarian was most pleased with the menu options we enjoyed the following a delicious chicken breast turkish pizza a combo plate including hummus and other appetizer type spreads that were great the lavash pellegrino and one shared glass of wine topped off the evening about $60 for the two of usvery reasonable for the quality of the food, first of all the food at efes is top notch worthy of 5 stars the service however is not top notch with only 1 other table at the beginning of my dinner and only 3 others by the end i consistently had to call over the waiter to take my order remove plates ask for dessert menu after i finished eating i waited over 10 to have plates removed asked for bakhlava for dessert and advised that it was sold out it was only 7 pm then asked for 2nd choice and also advised that not available seems like a lot of time could have been saved if the waiter had simply advised me of that when he brought the menu over for dessertsthere are only 4 on the menu ultimately i had the rice pudding which was fantastic in sum efes has great food service is soso i have been here 3 times and will come back but for the 1 restaurant on ta i expect better service at least a thank you or come back does not need to be stuffy or over the top but just more efficient and friendlier would not hurt for me i would definitely come back by myself or a friend but would not bring a date or a business associate that i wanted to impress by the way efes can be difficult to find since it is not visible from the road but inside the courtyard of the 1885 building, it was a really great turkish  mediterranean meal i ever ate in shanghai overall the restaurant is pretty nice arranged and beautiful decoratedeven so a warm welcome of manager ramazan and his team definetely i will come back again to test the gorgeous turkish food
thanks ramazan for kind hospitality, good service  tasty very clear  very difficult find clear restaurant in china  good manager ramazan  thank you very much, my favorite is adana kebap delicious you should try prices are good very nice staff will come again, an excellent restaurant in central shanghai  we had a range of food and all was excellent good price for the quality of food highly recommend, we order from them regularly and really enjoy their kebabs the food is wonderful and reminds us of the food we got in turkey, excellent restaurant
good food and many variety of delicious foods appetizers and five stars services

warm welcome

10,"we have had lunches and dinners at many din tai fungs in many cities and we all agreed the one at xintiandi is still the best of all their soup dumplings is simply the best and so are many if not all of their cuisines all service staff are well trained to provide excellent service pick the less busy time as they do not accept reservations, i was treated to lunch here by the agency that i booked my travel plans with the food was yummy but comparatively expensive for the portion size against other traditional chinese restaurants for the price at this restaurants you would have been able to feed three pepole
having said all that the presentation service and quality of the food was outstanding and it would be difficult to fault these attributes in any way
what also was different was the number of westerners who were eating lunch in the restaurant the day i was there approximately half the patons were english speaking, i have been in asia for years way before din tai fung became famous i dont know what they did or who they paid to get ny times to review them so high but its by far over rated and exaggerated there are many better places to eat dumplings and dim sum this place aint cheap and really the food is just average
i am in asia every month of the year and i rarely go to this place its nice to see one time the kitchen area where they make the famous dumplings but that is about the only interesting thing, we are dtf fans had a quick xiao long bao 10 and fried pork fried rice meal with son cant go wrong with these it cost me 135 rmb
tip for tourists this is a great place as their staff always understand english menus are in english as well, i like this brach in hk and i wanted to try it in shanghai everything is the same only difference is that in shanghai there is an option to have 6 or 12 pieces i can be sure in this place food is always good its also not a cheap place, the service is great and the place is very clean the dishes are well done xian long bao and noodles with spicy sesame paste are my favourites but prices are too high for a traditional dim sum meal in others places you can eat the same things with the same quality for less for me is too touristic and fancy i prefer places for locals with more soul and less marketing but its a personal opinion so i give 45 however, nice restaurant in the kerry center jingan there are several other ones in shanghai by this chain this one is on the 3rd floor of the mall

big open room and good service a little pricey, you will never find better dumplings wantons rice etc than at this place quality of food is important to me and this restaurant surpassed my ecpectations you can watch them make it while you wait for the table service is little slow but food was unbelievable in 10 days while i was in shanghai i never found better dumplings anywhere, din tai fung is arguably the best restaurant to taste the famous xiaolongbao their variety is amazing and you even get an instruction manual how to eat xiaolongbao something like xiaolongbao for dummies, best dumplings ive ever had a sort of fast food vibe with excellent service amazing menu selection and really excellent food its no wonder these guys are opening up all over the world, having been our first meal in china i thought it was good but was hard to tell given the context of being the beginning of the trip and we hadnt obviously tried any other places a local whos pretty up on the scene confirmed its a good place to try though great location in proximity to the ritzcarlton otherwise hidden from the street because of the building complex, after visiting one of the beijing places tried this one beijing one was a lot more like a restaurant and this a railway station on ta dtf generally gets a very high score but this restaurant gets more local traffic than the shopping mall it is established in so the locals seems to appreciate the quality or the deal dim sum were good but those who rate it as fabulous may never gave tried the other more high end chinese restaurants the dishes other than dim sum were not spectacular the most wanted dim sum were sold out already at 1930 with my chinese guide i have been to really good local chinese restaurants also very beat nanking west riad where the quality was much better and the prices even lower but they are not on the western radar screens, i came here for lunch with some colleagues the dumplings were uniformly excellent and the service prompt and attentive i was gratified to find a number of vegetarian options on the menu, ding tai fung has always been my favorite restaurant dumplings chicken soup and deep fried pork chop are all on my must order list what i like the most about this restaurant chain is their consistency no matter on foods or services, a great place to visit after having been to the observatory in shanghai world financial centre you can watch your dim sung being prepared from your table as the kitchen is in full view the food was fabulous service efficient and quick go early as very popular and queues build up quickly, the place is loved by foreigners  all super easy to order and good hygene however as they are mostly basic dishes  it is rather over rated and a little on the higher side of the price points
but to get used to chinese food and for the convenience and stable performance is a recommendation, we always stop in when in shanghai the fresh made dumplings are absolutely amazing well worth the wait if there is a line up, yes its a chain restaurant but the food really is terrific its quick and theres a lot of variety for both vegetarians and meat eaters, this is a chain but the quality is fantastic you will have best chinese food experience fresh made express for you, with a window to the kitchen area you can see how they making all these lovely dumplings
try out a few different but still pork is a favorite
small dumplings in a soup is a good one and the spicy cucumber as a start
friendly staff and will help you out with how to eat have a chain of restaurants, my two favorite foods in china are peking duck and dumplings din tai fung is the gold standard for dumplings this is the second time here and again did not disappoint we ordered a wide variety of dumplings pork seafood vegetarian and they were all delicious piping hot tasty fillings and filled with juice yum we order some sides that were good but nothing like the main event, a place is up to date decor and cleanness service is excellent popular location the wait time is to be expect overall the food quality is not so bad but little pricey for simple meal and snack of course compare to original taipei din tai fung this place is lack of technique and quality, id had better meals for the price that we paid for 2 orders of xiao long bao and 14 steamed chicken definitely not worth the hype as we waited forever to have the food come out and when it did it was cold and lost its flavor i dont even understand why its part of a destination, much like din tai fung anywhere in the world the quality and taste are very good but the price matches if not exceeds this the price of the shanghai branch is the same as those back in australia in terms of aud even though in terms of local currency it is massively priced think about how much a plate of dumplings cost in a normal restaurant in either city theoretically should be a lot cheaper in china due to labour cost and produce cost but it isnt be adventurous and go try a local restaurant probably be more authentically shanghai too, this ding tai fung offers a shanghai perspective to the menu besides local flavour it also has a lot more cold dishes appetizers
the prices are similar to other outlets a family of 4 would spend about rmb 500 to 700 dependent on what you order of course, this is a nice restaurant to get some famous soup dumplings but dont forget to try some of the other nice local dishes they serve this is a bit cosier branch than the one over in pudong better suited for a nice dinner, this could be the shortest review ever written amazing soup dumplings go eat repeat
that being said din tai fung is more than some of the best soup dumplings in town  although if youre craving dumplings youve arrived home unassuming delicious food served steaming at your table the menu  although purposefully dumpingcentric  has a wide variety of dishes including warmcold noodles soups and pickles of all kinds if youre traveling during hairy crab season  make sure to have some crab soup dumplings as well, it was worth our day going over eventhough the place is not the fanciest the food is remarkable authentic not pricy and delicious, we went to this restaurant twice to enjoy their delicious dumplings we never ate such tasty ones they offer a wide range of dumplings and other excellent dishes the restaurant is very comfortable and the staff extremely kind the bill is fare, ive been eating there many times great service great consistency and excellent value for money it is a must in town, asked locals and expats alike and most said that din tai fung taiwanese was the best in the city was not disappointedexponentially better than what is available in san diego fun place great staffwill definitely check out the la location next time im up the road, open kitchen allowed one to view the creation of the wonderful dumplings the dumplings were the best i have tasted ever we kept ordering another 10 service was good and attentive, it is another outlet i went with my friends good food as always and the environment is better than some other outlet we ordered a bottle of yellow rice wine which wnet very well with the dishes we ordered good as standard ding tai feng, i cant believe none of my friends told me about this place thank you trip advisor and your reviewers this place has great taiwanese dumplings i am told it is a huge international restaurant but being australian i had never heard of it well worth the visit it gets busy but the staff are great the service is brilliant and the food is amazing not much ore i can say about this place but its a must if you have never been to one before, din tai fung is an international restaurant with locations all over the world but id say compared to the one in california and washington its on another level in shanghai with dozens of different kinds of dumplings its fun to order a bamboo steamer of every kind and be able to taste all of them and then of course order seconds of your favorite ingredients are fresh you can watch them make it and delicious and im hungry thinking about how good these dumplings are, this restaurant offers the best dim sum in town here and at the rest of its locations apart from this speciality of theirs they serve excellent chinese dishes and an awesome rice the price is good for the standard, love the food service is good atmosphere is family oriented and enjoyable food servers have a bit of english enough to get by cant wait to go back, exactly what youd expect from a dim sum restaurant in china very clean and efficient little english spoken but thats not a problem food quality was very good and tasty kids in our group loved the experience as well, it is a very good restaurant very taste if you are gourmet love food then you have to go otherwise you will regret it lol i am a tour guide in shanghai my clients love it all of them happy about it, go just go its so tasty and very well priced the staff are great and are very friendly you will not be disappointed, first thing in shanghai i have to go to din tai fung though we have this in hk it is never disappointing love shanghainese food here service is amazing courteous and efficient the best is the xiao lung bao and dan dan noodles though stir fried string beans could be better more deeper fried, din tai fung has a number of restaurants in the us but this one in shanghai is special great dumplings  can be crowded but worth the wait, enjoyed a delicious meal here we went with a couple of friends who live in shanghai and recommended this place they ordered a large variety of dishes the only thing i was not too keen on were the duck tongues very little meat and lots of gristle the drunken chicken and prawn and pork dim sum were absolutely delicious nice to be able to see into the kitchen to see the dishes being prepared would definitely recommend, lots of dumplings to choose from try the crab dumplings or soup dumplings  could not believe it was not packed and its in a mall food court no tourists there is also steamed buns which were delicate with variety chooses of the stuffing, i have had xiao long bao in the states before but never with such variety as they have here the hairy crab dumpling was my favorite the hot and sour soup was also delicious, i went here with a group of friends for lunch and went back the next week because it was so good id never had steamed soup dumplings so admittedly i may be biased but everything i had was delicious

we had the pork and pork and shrimp soup dumplings and a bunch of small sides everything was delicious but definitely get pork dumplings if you eat meatpork because theyre amazing, excellent food and perfect location for lunch or dinner the various kind of dumpling are a must not inexpensive but the quality is worth the price, first proper dim sum experience and i really enjoyed it popular restaurant great food and fast service not that cheap but worth the price would recommend, we had to wait 30 minutes but it was worth it different variety of soup dumpling and assortment of traditional chinese appetizers the service is superb which is rare in china the food was served in an expeditious manner and beer is cold although the new world is packed with tons of western restaurants din tai fong located on the second floor of the mall is the only one that was pack and you need to take a number saturday lunch hour average 2530 minutes wait, we were looking for lunch on a sunday we had to wait for a table but the system was efficient and didnt take too long the dumplings and buns were fresh and a fair price the service was pleasant and helpful","bar",0.999772338112248
100,"really nice place with fantastic view from their rooftop terrace in contrast to other bunds bars with a view which serve italian sportcars owners only this one is accessible for normal people, the service was average great meeting spot on the rooftop patio prices 50 yuan for a beer worth it having such a relaxing spot overlooking the skyline, friends had told me to head to the captain bar and i never would have found it if i hadnt looked it up in advance and followed the map on my phone the nearest subway is nanjing east and then its a couple of block walk the bar is on the 6th floor of a hostel the elevator goes to floor 5 and then you take the stairs up one more level the bar has reasonably priced drinks for shanghai cocktails are 70rmb the view from june window is spectacular over the bund they have a terrace but it was too cold for us to sit outside but i a sure in summer it would be great they ah e basic bar food also, small and cozy bar with fantastic view over the bund
tried a pizza and pasta good food to decent price
good range of beers and drinks, this is such a great spot for cocktails and just relaxing dont be put off by the entrance which is through the hostel downstairs because the bar itself is a little gem the view is off the bund and yet the cocktail prices are extremely low for the area a cocktail will set you back 70 rmb which is half the price of the long bar or the fairmont it is a friendly atmosphere and we had more cocktails than we needed my personal recommendation is the singapore sling, a real million dollar view at budget prices we read about this bar online and were more than impressed when we arrived for an evening on the bund the bar itself is really inviting with relaxed decor and lighting including a candle on every table the staff were really friendly and attentive even giving my chinese friend directions over the phone on how to get to the bar and find us considering the wonderful location the prices are very reasonable beers and gin  tonics were 50 rmb overall 1010 from me thanks for a great night, i really enjoyed this view of wei tan if you go to the sfwb then you are inside one of these buildings and the view is much different would recommend seeing both but this gives you a great vantage point of the bund with all the buildings shining brightly back at your from across the water

drinks are pretty good food is good and its a good place to meet foreigners its a much more relaxed setting than a place like bar rogue or another swanky rooftop bar with a view of the bund definitely stop in for a drink, great views great service fun and cosy setting sit inside or out with great views over the bund great place for sundowner drinks watching the bund light up excellent service many thanks yang guang, it is a great rooftop bar theres no doubt about it the cocktails and drinks may be quite overpriced but when you consider the view of the bund from their roof you may not mind the 60 yuan beverage quite so much it was a very nice atmosphere as well, the view is nice but doesnt justify paying premium prices for basic service in a mediocre establishment, the nice view on pudong skyline  cant justify the poor service  the staff has very non welcoming attitude we went there several time there  the prices are now crazy high for this kind of places  40 rmb a soft drink  and most of dishes over 70 rmb  we ask for pumpkin ravioli  they bring us 5 pieces they even refuse to give us a glass of hot water which is common in all china you pay the view not the food, this bar on the sixth floor of a hostel certainly doesnt charge hostel type prices its worth a visit for a drink or two for the view alone if you had there just as the sun is setting you will see a fantastic view of the shanghai skyline on the roof terrace bar if you head into the outskirts of shanghai far cheaper bars can be found, you come for the view and you stay for the view drinks are on the pricey side for hostel bar food was okay but the view is why you come, captains bar is one of the best places to hang out and have a look at pudong especially at night however over the past couple of years i noticed service has become very bad down to the fact that the waiter gives you the feeling you just interupt his nap together with increased prices i am not sure if i can call this a recommendation for sure there are better places in shanghai, if u want to relax while looking at the bund this place if perfect is a lil bit expensive but its worth it is in the sixth floor of an hostel the staff is really gente and some of them speak english the terrace has no light in order to have a better apreciattion of the ligths of the bund and the shanghai financial center they accept all kind of credit cards, you have a pretty good view but the hostel itself seems crowded and expensive for a dorm kinda room and also the view is not that close to the bund but all in all is nice to sit somewhere friendly and have a drink with your friends while having the bund infront of you, i was a bit put off when i heard it was on the top of a youth hostel but when i got up there i forgot about the place i walked in and enjoyed the view i would recommend getting there early enough to get a good seats we were arrived around 545pm the place fills up fast this place has awesome views its like watching a movie when the city lights up at night fine drinks and you can get food though we went to lost heaven which was in walking distance great place for a group or a couple to enjoy without paying a premium price for a drink, we very nearly walked away from this bar when we went in through a hostel but when we got to the roof we had a fantastic view of shanghai almost to ourselves food and drink were reasonably priced, compared to other locations on the bund such as bar rouge of even m on the bund captain bar is way cheaper and worths the shot drinks are a bargain 50rmb for a beer or a glass of house wine and the dishes are correct good pizza for 90rmb be careful the place is eventually crowded at night staff barely speaks english but as the menu does it is ok good place overall you can go with confidence, as mentioned in the title you can have a nice view of the bund if you sit towards the front on the balcony drinks prices are above average, went here one evening having been promised a great view but with lower prices than other bars on the bund food wasnt bad 7090rmb cocktails were a bit disappointing and overpriced 70rmb having said that the view was excellent and i plan on taking friends back here to have a look, great view of pudong on the 6th floor rooftop and plenty of room as we were able to find seats on a thursday night about 1030p having drinks view the beautiful lights of the pearl tower and other highrises of pudong was magical drinks were not cheap but less than other bars with the same view just know that they turn off the magical lights at 11pm, i had read about this place on a couple of websites and was excited to give it a go  because it is attached to a youth hostel i was not expecting anything over the top and nor was it 

to break it down its an overpriced dive bar on the roof of a hostel the bar itself is run down and dirty with old furniture the view is ok but still not that great  i presume the view at night would be better with the city lights but there are many places for a good view in the area that wont leave you feeling ripped off

we drank our two way over priced beers and left for a much nicer place that wasnt dirty and didnt make you pay through the nose for a view that is not that great, enjoyed the view while having drinks with friends on this roof top bar a great find hard to believe there is a hostel below, every time i go there im amazing by the very nice view of pudong area its a nice place to have a drink or a small snack in the evening time, the views of the shanghai skyline were second to none it was just a shame the cocktail i bought was massively overpriced and barely tasted of alcohol
wish i ordered a beer and i would recommend others to do so if they decide to visit, i really did not like this place the service is terrible and the bar is dirty and smelly its ok if your looking for a place for the view but actually prices are not so cheap for a youth hostel bar i went there just to see the view and hated this place i wont be going back for sure really dirty, captains bar is more an insider tip most tourist would not find here unless some expats staying in shanghai take them here
i liked the fresh draft beer selection enjoy pizza and of course the great view on the terrace to my feeling one of the best in shanghai, had a friend take me here  otherwise would never have found it go into the hostel and take elevator and stairs to the 6th floor nice little bar not crowded at all  but with an awesome view from the bund across the river and nice rooftop deck get there earlier if you want to see the best lights before the radio tower light show stops at 10pm was a little too cool to stay out on the rooftop in march  but still a great view even from inside the bar decent selection of beers but as other readers have said  on the pricier side avg 50 rmb for a hostel worth it for nice atmosphere view and good beer though, this was my first experience of staying a hostel and captains was a great experience i thought that a hostel would be dirty and small but this was just like staying in a small but cheap hotel but i dont mean cheap in a bad way youre right next to the bund and walking distance of some of the main areas of shanghai the only issue was the 70rmb <u+00a3>7 for us uk guys for a pint of lager if they sorted their prices for alcohol this place would have got 5 stars, nice view on pudong an hidden place to be visited  get a drink with friends either on the terrace or inside prices are affordable for so nice view and also closed to the bund, i think ive said everything in the title a pint is about eight euro here but in comparison with similar bars with that view this is not bad comfortable relaxed and enjoyable bar, probably on of the cheapest viewpoints to look at the bund but compared to the prices in local bars its pretty expensive a great location to enjoy the bund and one of the most valuable places to stay in shanghai city, this place is all about the view the interior is comfortable enough and there are some import beers for import prices 60rmb theres not much to add beyond the photo that has already been shared its behind the thai condsulate close to m on the bund itll cost you more at the latter to enjoy that view, many of the venues around this area can be a bit expensive but this is not too bad on a warm night the balcony would be a great place to have a drink or food with a fantastic cityscape view we only ate pizza which was fine nothing special but ok and not expensive
its a bit different i would go back, this is my favorite bar in shanghai it is above a youth hostel so many people do not know about it the view of lujiazui is outstanding the beer and food are cheap but incidental on a clear day head to captains for a beer and some food and enjoy the view, after a busy day of sightseeing in shanghai this bar was a refreshing stop with a fantastic view of the bund, best place to go to when you want to have a nice view on the bund the roof terrace they have is fairly small however if you are lucky you can find a nice spot drinks are okay inside they have a big screen with sports perfect place to introduce people to the bund and to experience this impressive area, great little secret in shanghai the views are spectacular  a little above average for drink prices but well worth the visit
our meal was forgotten but this did not spoil our enjoyment and we reordered the food, great spot to take in the skyline and have a cocktail or beer outdoor seating and a very laid back atmosphere they have a decent selection of beers and my wifes mojito was very good price is about on par for places with this view would definitely return, thats one of the best places of mine amazing breathtaking view low key totally but the food is cp please do not go there as its gonna be crowded hahaha there is a lift  top floor and that open air terrace  all in wood yeah  great it is a kind of tough to find it lol , went here for a few drinks with friends the view is spectacular but the prices are expensive by chinese or english standards considering its a hostel bar in china the prices should be a lot lower didnt stay for long as there are much cheaper places to drink in shanghai, great view of the pudong  and roof tops of the bund beer 5070 rmb including a couple of good bottled ipas  cocktails 70 rmb  not bad prices for the location, this is an ok bar with a pretty amazing view of the shanghai skyline so a great place to call at night to look at the lit up skyline the bar is above captains hostel you have to go into the hostel reception and then in a rather murky lift and up a few steps up to the bar on the sixth floor

the drinks and food are a touch on the expensive side but not excessively so there is no cover charge to get in which is fab for such a good view so i guess negates the higher food prices

the menu is pretty basic with burgers and pizzas but it is good filling food you only get about ten chips with the burgers though so if youre hungry you might want to order a separate portion there are a couple of veggie options  pizzas and salads the menu is also in english which is helpful

the staff arent the friendliest of people ive come across but they were ok one thing that was slightly disappointing was that the bar closed at 10pm we were there on a friday night so were quite surprised at that as we would have quite liked to have stayed later for more drinks, this was an excellent spot to sit for a nice view of the bund you are a little further back but the spot still makes for a some good pictures for being part of a hostel though the prices are very high usually hostel drinks are cheap in my experience you are paying normal shanghai prices for bottled beers and mixed drinks i do not recommended getting mixed drinks here they are small and not the best

there was hardly anyone there when we went so the service was great staff seemed friendly probably wouldnt go back there are many other places on the bund in the same price range that are of much higher quality, this is a cheap bar on top of a hostel on the 7th floor the beers are cheap for shanghai and you get great views of the bund, mostly at the bund are is fancy cafe and resto if you are in budget but wanna have experience to have beer or dining with bund view in front of your eyes just come to this place you only need spend rmb 50 for 1 beer makesure coming before sunset to get the front seat located on the top floor of the hostel staffs speak lil english but they understand enought what we want worth it, the good

the views

the not so good

service can be hit and miss

the views of the bund are amazing it is not right on the bund but it has unrestricted views of it beers were average prices for drinking out in shanghai we stopped here for a couple of beers and it was a really lovely experience, situated on the 6th floor of captain hostel elevator to go up is tiny and mirrorless and does not give much hope for whats to come
however once you get to the bar it is a pretty one it has a very cosy environment and tables are lit with numerous red candles the view of pudong buildings from the terrace is a lovely one smokers go out on the terrace so that means that the bar inside is free of smoking 
good choice of cocktails at rmb70 i asked for a negroni which wasnt listed and it tasted good
staff have some knowledge of english enough to give a basic service but i dont think they understand lots of detail might be a problem if you have specific dietary requirements menu has good english translation
food menu has a variety of west pub foods i had a vegetarian pizza which was decent but the wait was a bit too long
all in all it was a good evening , located near the bund this is a quite surprising bar there is an amazing view on pudong you dont expect

even if the drinks are quite expensive this is worth the view

101,"by a side the we ended up in this high sealing old style restaurant we ended up buying a fixed menus of cold +warm  grilled meat it was superb fantastic tastes and good cocked can recommend, came here for dinner with a large group of friends on a weekend night it was really busy great atmosphere make sure you prebook a table loved the idea of a fixed menu the food comes as is and there is plenty of it it also saves so much time deciding what to eat as you can just have it all  multiple hot and cold starters multiple entrees and a few dessert items every course was a taste pleaser and nobody went hungry lots of choices and new things to try the only thing i felt a bit let down was the dessert  a fruit platter and a rather bland creme brulee wine was reasonably priced by the glass a couple other cool bars in the complex for drinks pre or post dinner would recommend it for the good qualityprice ratio, my first visit here was great food and service were both great i was with a large group that had prebooked and we all had a fantastic time

yesterday for my 2nd visit my experience was not as good we hadnt prebooked but the restaurant was practically empty so they had a table free for us we ordered but several dishes were not available not a problem for us

my starter falafel was tiny 5 miniature balls roughly the size of largish grapes my partners prawn starter was better tasty and a reasonable size portion

our main meals his lamb and my chicken were average not great not awful

the worst bit about the evening was the way they rushed us our main meal came before wed finished our starter and they tried to remove the starter before we were ready then when we wouldnt let them take the starter they tried to fit the main meal on the table as well but there wasnt room

as we were eating they were clearing the restaurant acceptable if we had come in very late and they were closing but other diners were continuing to come in long after wed finished eating

overall we felt rushed and as if our custom wasnt really wanted a shame because the only reason i picked the restaurant for what was a significant celebration meal for us was because my previous visit had been so great

i wont be returning for a 3rd visit unfortunately, first of all lets start by the service  above and beyond anything seen so far in china way better than poche restaurants like mr  mme bund  glass of water always full offer tea and cream to appologize for order small mistake  wow
then the food  nothing to worry about but it is simply good while being a bit pricy  paid 900 rmb for 4 excluding drink over all stays a very good dinner experience, lets start by the great  the service it is honestly above and beyond anything i have seen in china way above restaurants like mr  mme bund  water glass always full  offer tea and cream to apologie for a mistake  wow
then the food is simply good it is a bit pricy  paid 900 rmb for 4 without drinks over all very good dinner experience, we were able to visit this restaurant 2 times while living in shanghai absolutely wonderful food presentation of the set menu was out of this world anyone who hasnt been there and reading this review should definitely go there the set menu is for about 1517 different items total for cold and hot appetizers main entrees and desserts just fabulous, didnt get to take photos
but food was amazing bobby the manager is very very customer oriented
food fantastic wine excellent and very affordable

highly recommended, the restaurant is hidden in a small alcove easily accessible from nanjing road the restaurant was large but decor is rather dark it could do with a little more turkish decoration the meal was great really authentic turkish food nicely presented and backed up by good efficient service for starters we had the yoghurt with mint together with a warm hummus and shredded lamb followed by dolma stuffed vine leaves and kofta the meal was finished off with a wonderful angel hair dessert and turkish coffee all in all a great experience at a reasonable price i would definitely go back just for the food, i went last night for the second time on the first occasion i had the dinner set menu which was really a lot of food this time i ordered a la carte the slow cooked lamb dish  cooked for 6 hours is very good and not available on the set menu i notice they do lunch sets for rmb138 which given the quality of the food seems good value service is not always as good as it could be, good turkish food in this very nice restaurant service can be improved affordable prices for the quality you get, black pepper provides an excellent balance between price and quality the food is amazing and it wont leave your wallet too much lighter the staff are very efficient and speak good english the atmosphere is casual yet suitable for more formal or romantic occasions

the food is known all around shanghai for its authentic take on modern turkish cuisine the lamb dishes are unlike anything else in shanghai

although the desserts look kind of strange in the menu you will regret it if you decide not to order one of them, went for a meal while away on business plenty of availability on a friday night in august
service slow and food average  nothing special in my opinion service slow and not very helpful  wanted to upsell and offer the more pricey options and unclear regarding portion size
several of the wines on the wine list were not available but this was not indicated until we tried to order them
not great value for money  i have been there before and it was considerably better
they dont accept amex, visited with a group of work colleagues and went for the set menu offered a great selection and something for everyone good atmosphere and the wait staff were extremely helpful and attentive will definitely go again, we were greeted by the turkish owner who paid is special attention the whole evening and was super friendly and regaled us with stories from turkey when given the opportunity the food was delicious and very affordable for the quantity highly recommend this place, shanghai never ceases to amaze after walking down an alley and turning a few corners while wondering whether you took the right directions theres a courtyard of barsrestaurants and black pepper is on the first floor food was high quality slow roasted lamb generously portioned literally melt in the mouth and the service was super the staff were hospitable and helpful round an unfamiliar to us menu what we also liked were the high ceilings and fact that we could enjoy dinner and chat there was a buzz but not so loud that you couldnt talk across the tables clientele were a mix of expats visitors and intheknow locals, we been supper rainy day for lunch after hospital visit
based on set menus and same dishes you can eat as a la carte menu bigger portion
price is good they use good quality meat beverage they have a large turkish wine menu which i never taste a turkish wine so i have no knowledge but price is high for non known wines they have turkish raki and beers too unfortunately it was rainy day and we went little late for for lunch and there was no people only us service is ok interior desing is good there too many table if it is full i dont see any space for privacy overall weekend for large group of friends would be fun, great location in the heart of the shopping district tastefully decorated with exposed brick and designer decor food doesnt let down either with delicious classic turkish dishes made to perfection would liked to have seen a better selection of mezze on the menu though and the standard bread rolls were a poor replacement for the normally delicious bread options that a good turkish restaurant would serve located in a great little square full of other trendy eateries this being tucked away upstairs without a terrace or patio probably makes it a better choice on foggy or cold days or evenings, went there with a few friends based on a recommendation not disappointed taxi took us to the entrance of a alley didnt think too much of the building around this area once we entered the courtyard shared with a few eateries and the scenery changed to very nice
food is lamb focused not surprised order a few starters and a few main dishes shared among 5 of us ordered a red and a white turkish wine reasonably priced and fine food were wonderful and the setting was good yes try their 6 hours slow roasted lamb leg, the decor is nice and clean and the food is awesome for a first visit we chose the dinner set and not one dish disappointed us the food was very flavorful and the meat very tender the description looks overwhelming but the serving are of appropriate size bonus for shanghai the service was fantastic we all had our fist courses at the same time and our dinner at the same timeunlike many places our dinner did not come before appetizers
i will go back, great restaurant in many levels

food is delicious execution is on point and ingredients are extremely fresh

decor and atmosphere are awesome a mixed on industrial loungy and chic, my best friend took me to dine at this place as i havent had turkish food before i didnt know what to expect on being served with series of elegant looking appetizers side dishes main dishes and out of the world dessert i was convinced the experience will last in my memories for a lifetime, as soon as you walk in you feel the great ambiance the menu and the wine list is terrific we were there three families and ordered whole bunch of different items from the menu the food is as good as you can taste anywhere in the world at a turkish restaurant if you are in shanghai this is a must visit place, the food was simply amazing and the presentation was very beautiful great service lovely atmosphere including several bottles of wine the price was reasonable for shanghai
it is easy to think they only have a set menu but in fact they do have an a la carte menu however the value you get with the set menu really cant be beat, the dining area is comfortable clean and not too loud at least when i was there the foods are typical turkish style and deliciously prepared for me the portions are a little bit too much but i have a smaller appetite anyway the service is good the ownermanager was very nice and welcoming the prices are typical for the style and area, the model here is a bit different to other restaurants  you order a set for around 238 rmb per person which includes 5 cold appetizers 5 warm appetizers and then the most impressive part of the meal  the meat  which is served on very long platters that arrive in dramatic fashion and motivates everyone to get their cameras out if they didnt already have them out the bigger the group the longer the plank so this is definitely something thats better in larger groups however if there are only two of you they simply reduce the amount of food so its still a great choice

wines are exclusively imported from turkey and i dont think there are any cheap options so if you do enjoy some wine with your meal be prepared to pay for something at least in the midhigh tier

i think they only offered the set deal at first but i have heard they do now offer a la carte options as well but if its your first time i highly recommend you try the set option first

im a big fan of turkish food and black pepper is somewhere i have no hesitation to recommend to anyone the food is great the ambiance is perfect the service is warm and friendly, it has a great setting and the location is great but the fact that you have no menu to choose from and only work with a set doesnt sit well with me

the volume of food is too much heavy and not very good if you go with a date changing to a a la carte menu will definately help bring return business as if you try it once why to come back if i tasted everything, as i expected foods are quite good service is mediocre music sometimes goes beyond turkey orientalism, i stayed at the chalet and i was graving for turkish food so my friends showed me this place in a lovely compound with other bars and restaurant called zhangyuan 99 on taixing road 99 the place was packed so a sweet tuerkish waitress asked if we would mind to wait 20 minutes which was ok so we set in the entrance area which is quite comply as well she rushed to bring us tea and in less then 20 minutes we got a nice table she recommended the set menu as we came for the first time to get a good taste of what they have to offer and also a nice wine to go with it food came fast and was amazing fresh with great ingredients served nicely decorated and was just yummy we spend about 3 hours and loved it although afterwards i had a food coma too much too good food the set included starters a meat combo platter bread and dessert we ended our meal with a nice strong turkish coffee and i will go there again for sure great place for bigger groups very lively yet not insane and the decoration is beautiful and comfortable with big seat arrangements and nice lighting we were mostly served by the turkish wait staff and all of them were very sweet prices are not the cheapest but for what you get reasonable we ordered the set menu for 3 but actually the food would have been enough for 3 people ordering just for 2 if one does not want to overeat, as a turkish it is difficult to find a good turkish taste out of turkey but black pepper has a good taste but expensive but which eurpean restaurant not in shangha only negative is no wifi available and some traditional kebaps are not in the menu, great dinner but the atmosphere made the place truly enjoyable the staff was accommodating our colleagues who had allergies and special requests, amazing place the decor is spot on for a quiet environment and the food is amazeballsgood the set menu is perfect since it gives you a little bit of everything and is enough food even for big guy ask for a recommended red wine and you will have an amazing night, beautiful restaurant with a great ambiance and menu however the owner  staff is really not understanding customer service at all and is very inflexible we will never visit again, i�ve enjoyed every meal i�ve had at garlic so when i heard the proprietor had opened a new restaurant i was naturally interested in giving it a try black pepper had been favorably reviewed by the majority of expat platforms and for one simple reason for the price it offers a reasonable meal however in most reviews there has been a discussion around �20 courses� when in reality there are 35 courses of 1620 dishes i�m using the word �dishes� quite liberally here a cut up banana hardly counts as a dish does it when i think twenty course dining experiences something like ultraviolet come to mind so alas i fell victim to unreasonably high expectations

black pepper is its pretty good for what it is it makes simple small dishes with inexpensive ingredients it would be a great choice for a staff dinner quality is fine the meat portion of the meal was excellent dessert course was a bit of a letdown you get two micro portions of some kind of cinnamon pudding along with baklava you also get three plates of chopped fruit

i would also call into question the idea that you�ll leave stuffed to the gills while no means a tiny meal i left feeling a bit peckish

what it tries to be and in my mind somewhat unsuccessfully is fine dining
overall i would rather spend the same money at garlic for what would likely be a more enjoyable meal, are at this restaurant after arriving in shanghai a few hours earlier the restaurant is situated in a great little square which has a european feel the food is great and no need to worry about what to eat as it is a set menu there are cold then warm starters before the main course arrives on a long wooden platter the only disappointment was the chicken dessert which is as strange to taste as it is to say all in all a great experience, this restaurant is gorgeous to look at and the service and food certainly dont disappoint either our friend brought us here and we had no idea how lovely it would be the way the buildings been converted is beautiful and along with the lighting it creates a very romantic atmosphere the idea of a fixed menu is great it saves so much time deciding what to have as you can just have it all everything we had was delicious and very fresh and wellcooked this is definitely somewhere ill be recommending to friends visiting shanghai, we went on sunday for the brunch and it was really very pleasant decoration is nice the service was quite helpful we have two babies the food quality and amount was really good plenty of different flavors a great value for the money we will go back and will bring our friends, the set menu is full of delicious food the dinner comes with multiple hot and cold starters multiple entrees and a few dessert items it is all good except the dessert sultans chicken and turkish ice cream is not tasty to me

the servers are attentive and some speak english very well, my husband and i stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago and as someone who loves to eat out this was one of my top 5 meals of all time there are 20 twenty courses but everything is timed perfectly the staff is so accomodating the wine was fantastic and the food leaves me speachless ok not that speachless each course was balanced fresh served in perfect succession in perfect portions and everything tasted like a homegrown twist on the classics i will dream about this meal for a very long time simply if you like food you will love this restaurant, i wouldnt normally go to a restaurant where you dont order your food but having seen the other dining tables full of amazing plates i knew it was a good decision start with cold starters and salads with bread then hot starters great prawns and as someone else mentioned hot hummus with pepperoniwhich was delicious then out came a long plank of wood covered in meat and vegetables again really succulent meat and well cooked finally to finish some fruit for desert a nice way just to end the dinner wine was reasonably priced so overall very reasonable

the dining room had a nice feel and it was busy even on a tuesday night so id probably book if you wanted to ensure you got a table

will definately go back, went for brunch which was a 3 course set menu with 2 to 3 options per course food was flavorful and not shanghai oily we liked everyone we were served warm hummus with pepperoni was an unusual but yummy twist reasonable priced wine by the glass will definitely go again a couple other cool bars in the complex for drinks post dinner, friends in shanghai always know where to eat nexti asked my friend where i could take some other friends somewhere i hadnt been before and he said go to black pepperits awesome

fisrt of all its ain a great location and you can get a proper beer downstairs at the tap house before dinner

black pepper styling its uber cool vibrant and always busy so book early the concept is great sometimes in sh the menu is too big and you dont know what to orderfear not here because the only choice you get is what to drink i recommend the turkish anis drink with ice and waterperfect

the food comes as is and there is plenty of it every course was a taste pleaser and nobody went hungry lots of choices and new things to try the main courses come served on a long and narrow wooden bridge a nice touch as it means no need to clear the table of that lovely hummous dip and bread the manager was great he came to explain everything and was a perfect host

id definately go again and take some other friends so they can try the experience not sure after that as i then may get tired of the same thingbut i doubt ithaha great stuff, went for dinner 2 weeks ago with cold and warm starters the appetite was whetted to expect more starters were very delicious the main dish with lamb chops chicken and roasted vegetables were cooked to perfection the only thing i did not care for was the ground chicken breast dessert but our host was exceptional spoke 7 languages and made sure that we were taken care of
i would highly recommend this place, glad to see a turkish restaurant like this very nice designed good service yummy food really authentic i will definitely go again, had lunch with several girlfriends at black pepper last week truly one of the best meals i have ever had in a restaurant the food is served family style and nearly every dish was sublimelamb with eggplant meatballs smoked salmon stuffed grape leaves dumplings pasta hummus lentil soup the desserts even the freshly baked bread sorry i cannot list the correct names for all the dishes every meember of our party was delighted with the delicious food the service was excellent and the manager was on hand to answer questionshe even brought extra lamb dishes for our australian i do not need to recommend any specific dish as the best way to enjoy black pepper is to order everything on the menu and relish every bite we will definitely be back best enjoyed with several friends or couples, the concept and location are appealing  zhong plaza on taxing lu is a hot spot and a four course menu for 288 rmb is a bargain the classical meze is split between hot and cold starters the portions are luckily not too large but large enough that you will gain weight the cold starters are good  the classical coban salatasi was a finely cut mix of cucumber and tomatoes with a lot of herbs and a just right acidity the yoghurt based  haydari paste was fresh  herbal  lemony and as expected not drawn with garlic complementary bread was partially great but the one type  a kind of bazlama was hard and dry the other was more chewy though not yet close to real tasty lavas or pide muhammara a paste of dried mild chili powder walnut and garlic was great walnut dishes are some of the most unique and tasty features of turkish cuisine  cerkez tavugu being a disappearing gem of this great cuisine you wont find in shanghai  but could have been spiced a little more vigorously strange lowlight smoked salmon filled with ruccola this is not a turkish specialty and does not taste really great  why was this included when turkish cuisine has so much to offer  piyaz patlican salatasi fava would have been better choices specially as the final humus sesamchickpeagarlic paste was also rather bland
warm starters were a lowlight why were the vine leave dolmas warm and with cheese normally their cold acid and salty taste contrasting the starchy lightly sweetened filling is the kick you are looking for salted pepperry sucuk sausage omelette was bland but no blame as how to get the real delicious sucuk to shanghai  and the low quality shrimps had nothing to do with turkeys karides nor with good taste  so warm starters felt short to remind you all the delicacies of turkish warm starters eg arnavut ciger warm fried liver or izgara borek  fried fetacheese filled pastry mixed grilled meat as main was really great  grilled meat pirzola lamb ribs  kofte grilled meatballs  and herbed grilled chicken were all delicious  as main is the most important part of the dinner  the great taste of the grilled meat justifies the visit  desert was a shortfall and also a big miss instead of promised desert we just got convenience style  kazandibi grilled version of tavuk gogusu a delicous desert made of chicken breast  this tasted bland like a convenience product and a lot fruits which were good but not more  without comment we were not served the promised baklavas or any other delicious pastries   so a great venue with a nice service that needs to improve consistency and some quality issues on food  but its really a nice location and a good concept  just not yet up to the promises skip the salmon  improve the warms starters and serve promised baklavas and this could be a great place, following the footsteps of the wellestablished pasha and garlic black pepper is another nice addition to the turkish food lovers world housed in an old shanghai building right off nanjing xi lu the restaurant is located on the second floor and boasts views over the quaint courtyard the decor is very warm and welcoming perfect for lunch  romantic dinner or friends gettogether the food is delicious and perfectly seasoned just like pasha and garlic lamb reigns supreme cooked in several tasty versions lunch set is 128 rmb and includes a choice of appetizer main and dessert, went there twice once on a date once with family while hidden in a courtyard tucked behind a small alleyway it is not difficult to find it sure doesnt look turkish from a glace in its interior decor more like an italian mafia restaurant setup but great ambiance nonetheless food was quite nice but was a little disappointed with their lamb which was supposed to be the star dish on its menu, i recommend that restarurant if you are looking a real turkish kebab test they make very delicious kebab all mediterranen foods are excellent i loved that restaurant and decoration, the good reviews are true so i am not going to repeat them read and trust them very nice warm atmosphere good food and wine
also appropriate for larger groups
you will have a very entertaining evening, this place is definitely hidden but once you have arrived in this old factory courtyard and go up to the second floor you will not regret it the lunch menue is 148 rmb and you get a starter a main course and really great deserts try the lamb or the turkish icecream followed by a turkish mocca great and good value the inside of the restaurant is stylish and upmarket although rather on the dark side but with nice old wooden floors service is good they speak eglish well and the turkish owner is very helpful you can also go to garlic which is also ownee by them and is also great obviously they are planning another site in xintiandi soon
one thing they have to improve they cannot give you a fapiao so if you come on business you might have to make arrangements with them
one more note downstairs there is a great little cafe and dessert place called taste and see try this one as well","Turkish cuisine",0.406855198412178
102,"good food and service beautiful location but prices are too high for what they offer i will not repeat, food and service are second to none highly recommended for both the price is consistent with xintiandi that is its not cheap compared to areas outside xintiandi but this one is worth every cent an amazing meal, friends invited me for a weekend champagne brunch when i first discovered the place i was pleasantly enjoying the brunch because the food is pretty good but i am more fascinated with the venue

designed as a loft va bene has large windows which enable streams of sunlight enter the restaurant to give it generous natural sunlight a tall ceiling to create a sense of space and finally the massively long communal table that can seat 4050 people which made me felt like i had lots of friends dining with me

unlike other places that hold back on drinks the freeflowing prosecco came generously

it was a nice place and i would definitely come back, we tested seafood and traditional pasta all excellent but especially the grilled seafood all dishes took care of the look the room is quite good for conversation, very good italian food in shanghai we had risotto with mushrooms buratta and ravioli with pumpkin and sage everything was tasty but risotto was a highlight of the dinner they also have very good aperol spritz it is a bit pricy but worth it, i went to shanghai on business in june 2016 the restaurant is located in xintiandi the italian food was very good as well as the service it is very good for a business lunch as it was not too noisy you can walk around xintiandi afterwards if you have time, the restaurant is in an amazing area of shaghai very good italian restaurant with a beautyfull atmosphere, we made a tour stop in the french concession section of shanghai we were on our own for lunch but our tour guide recommend vabene restaurant we arrived about noon and were the only customers it was clean modern and upscale we were immediately seated and provided with drinks  warm real nice looking rolls bread etc the manager stopped by to chat and took our order as it was not on their regular luncheon menu my wife had a special soup and garden salad i ordered pasta with carbonera sauce both dishes were prepared fresh  fresh pasta    delicious
i cant recall dessert but we loved that also by the time we left the restaurant was almost full
the manager was daniele baldo  from venice italy  they also have restaurants in hong kong  beijing, we have visited many times the food is top notch and we have never been disappointed the dj sunday brunch is great if you are in the mood for some classic music and an amazing meal great service and friendly staff highly recommended if you are in the xintiandi area, firsttime visit to vabene w a table of 8 for a client lunch bold space pleasant terrace and very friendly attentive staff bustling buzz in the main dining room food is fresh wellprepared and wellportioned  fairlypriced

located in a really fun shanghai neighbourhood with many bar and resto options def going to return for dinner great firstvisit, chef  manager were really nice and professional food was great and the atmosphere was cosy and nice, nothing to add it speaks by itself you just need to try it once  from the chef to the manager  both italians  and the exquisite food  best bursts in town delicious seafood soup beef and so on and  unknown to many best afternoon tea set in town  that thank god doesnt focus on the usual macaroni  tea or other poor stuff you find anywhere but its a real deal with food sweet and salty and enough for two and for a more then reasonable price   the courtesy and warm attention put by the two italian guys is the real add on of this venue, a little corner in the midst of xtd main spot excellent service but food is average for the price there are better choices in shanghai for that buck, yes the chinese restaurants we dined in were all good for a break we walked from jw marriott tomorrow world and found vabene in xintiandi what a great accident we went at an odd time  maybe 300 pm on a weekday so the place was literally deserted and quiet before we left 2 other couples arrived so still could enjoy a leisurely pleasant meal love the modern feel and the murals on the walls excellent wait staff although we ordered mussels to start and when we asked what happened to our starter the manager was surprised he found the server and realized the order for our starter was never submitted to the kitchen he immediately came over and delivered 2 more glasses of our chosen wine were actually happy they didnt make it as the outstanding bread basket along with an order of bruschetta prior to our pasta dishes were far too much the pasta was excellent service was good and we will definitely return maybe not at night as other reviews indicate the evening can be loud wonderful area to walk during the day or night because of the selection of restaurants and shops, we never really dined out in xintiandi every place always felt too touristy but while staying at the ascott we explored the neighborhood and definitely this restaurant was the highlight in terms of culinary experience

the interior apparently was renovated recently its on the first floor modern and casual no white table cloth but not even too informal
i would say the right balance

we ordered veal with tuna sauce with olive oil snow flakesgreat touch of molecular gastronomy a caprese interpretation and a seafoodlobster grilled platter

paired with glasses of red wine

the produces were of great quality everything was well balanced and tasty

the absolute most amazing element was the loligo squid from patagonia
my wife doesnt like squid due to the texture but when i tried and forced her to taste it too she was surprised at how tender they were
truly exceptional

plus point the head chef came and explained upon my enquiry how to create olive oil snow flakesextremely nice of him

a sorbet to cleans the palate was offered at the end of the dinner

service was good and the price well within the acceptable
2 starters plus the platter 3 glasses of wine and sparkling wine was around 1200 cny, there is no shortage of great restaurants in shanghai but consistency over many years is hard to find i have been to vabene for lunch dinner drinks on countless occasions the wine list is always great the cocktails can compete with great bars in london and the food is amazing it is a must visit for me on my trips to shanghai for business or solo meals
mr baldo is a gracious host and kind enough to accommodate regulars without reservations the staff is always polite and speak english
i have tried most of the restaurants and bars and there is very little competition in the french concession, comming from norway visiting shanghai for a short week eating nuddles and then found this pearl executive summary good and professional service and topp foodquality amazing dinner and envirement thanks to vabene, the food is simply amazing people and service is what italy can offer at its best

chef nataliano is like maradona daniele is a rockstar

after 6 years in asia this is by far the best italian restaurant i have ever been, when it comes to food i tend to lean towards home cooking i rarely find a nice restaurant that impresses me to the point where i would want to come back again so when my friends said lets eat nice italian i rolled my eyes and begrudgingly went along man this place is amazing beautiful ambiance and a very kind and attentive staff it just feels comfortable we started with mussels cheese and salmon for appetizers just delicious unique and light enough that they did not fill you up for the main course ok here goes i ordered the lamb this succulent chops were the best ive ever had in my life tender and tasty i couldnt get enough 2 out of the 4 people at my table dislike lamb but after tasting mine they remarked that they would order it next time my wifes sea bass was tender and moist just amazing all the way around couple with wine we were well on our way to a fantastic dinner we went full out and ordered dessert as well the creme de brule was fantastic but the star of the show was lemoncoconut ball of deliciousness blew my mind i believe we talked and ate for over 3 hours mostly about the food and comfortable atmosphere ok reality check i am cheap and i dont part with my food dollars easily but i will be back to vabene this is the kind of restaurant that can easily become a lifetime favorite bravo, set in the heart of xintiandis restaurant and shopping row vabene delivers high quality italian dishes in a warm and inviting environment chef natalino is a very impressive chef who knows how to make each dish memorable teamed with the attentive and skilled manager danielle they make sure you are truly enjoying your meal

for starters we ordered the caprese salad mussels and cured salmon each dish popped with flavor ive eaten each of these dishes many times at many other restaurants but the quality of the ingredients in each of these dishes really stood out this is where you could tell a talented chef was preparing your meal

vabenes homemade pasta is a must as are the punpkin raviolis light buttery smooth super fresh

for mains the lamb chops were cooked perfectly my wifes risotto was fragrant and just the right portion size served in its own cast iron dish

we were stuffed at this point and mentioned having enjoyed a sgropino while in italy years ago danielle knew exactly what we needed to make the bridge to dessert lemon sorbet never tasted so good

for desserts we were all thrilled with the tiramasu and a creative coconut lemon ball conconction that none of us had seen before the kitchen really showed its talent throughout all courses of the meal

we cant wait to return to vabene and try more of the items on the menu and have personally tailored cocktails made by danielle

a trule memorable meal, i attended a dinner at vabene during this recent trip to shanghai and found the atmosphere service and food to be excellent the space is on the 2nd floor and is very modern with an old shanghai twist the bartender knows how to pour a proper cocktail and the pasta is fresh try the pan fried foie gras and the lobster spaghetti excellent overall and i hope to return again soon, you want brunch on a sunday with wine and affortable prizes  va bene is he place to go to  great chef natilino ambra will great each of his guests and his chinese staff are friendly great place, used to plan coming here all the time until the food started slipping  example the seafood soup used to be served in a large preserve jar with a lid the quantity was good the jar stayed warmhot the soup was excellent now a small portion of poor quality soup is served in a bowl which gets cold very quickly
they dont do veal milanese  i cant believe it
service mediocore some try others are invisible
food is average
i am always cold in this restaurant it looks cozy but it is cold
coffee mediocre, restaurant manager daniele showed arrogance and ignorance at the same time my guests were shocked and put off very negative experience the loud music made it impossible to speak at the table nicely asked to turn the sound down to background music the manager showed up and said the music can not be turned down in a very arrogant tone restaurant was 70 empty at friday night at 2000h
later we had to refuse a bottle of red wine with cork the manager again showed up pretending the wine was good we did not dare to refuse the fish that was obviously overcooked from deep freezer 
all in all nice place  incompetent and arrogant management  questionable product, our hotel recommended vabene in xintiandi and it was a good recommendation the main dining area is upstairs in a big open area they have this huge long table set up down the middle of the room the service was good as was the food i enjoyed my risotto prices are ok this being xintiandi, it is a bit expensive but that is representative of the area the food is excellent and i like the odd lay out of the tables and the cosy atmospher you will potentially be very close to the table next to you we normally share a few smaller dishes and this works well here the staff are also good which can not be expected in shanghai this is a good place for a nice date night, we were recommended to come here by a friend in the uk and were not disappointed friendly service a table on the outside terrace and a good italian menu  exactly what was needed after a tiring day exploring the wonderful city that is shanghai the bread was delicious as was the tuna tartare and the marinated salmon starter i had the lamb chops which were excellent and my husband had the mac n cheese with truffle oil which was absolutely delicious real comfort food its a good location for a walk afterwards as situated in the xintiandi area which is full of shops restaurants and bars, delicious offerings in a pretty location in xintiandi the risotto was absolutely delicious our waiter was lovely as was everyone we came in contact with, a friend suggested italian for dinner for a bit of a break from traditional and local offerings the atmosphere is very nice upon entering with an excellent diversity in dish options

offered an amusebouche of eggplant which was reminiscent of eggplant parmigiana wouldnt have minded having an entire slice on a sandwich

we had carpaccio for our appetizer which was delightful it set a great foundation for what was to come

had the steak for a main course but the main draw the foie gras on the side  it did not disappoint while the steak was excellent cooked to request that foie gras something else and it was served on top of a lightly fried potato would almost call it a large upscale tater tot it was lovely

vabene is definitely a great spot for some western cuisine while in shanghai, not the best italian restaurant in the city but surely not the worst
the service is very good and the food depending on your likening good
what let this place down in my opinion are the very small portions particularly compared with the price rather a shame because it makes you not wanting to return for an otherwise good restaurant, i have been there with friends to try their set lunch the review is very easy good service nice food and a good balance with the price highly suggested, this is a great little piece of italy in the middle of shanghai the menu is straight out of rome or venice friendly staff and a great wine selection as well, im not sure how many italians there are in shanghai but if you are in the mood for some italian food this place should do the job while the food was not amazing it was good the service was very good and the generally surroundings were nice overall we had a nice meal but it didnt blow me away, first time here and was seated quickly upon arrival decided on a la carte items as opposed to the tasting menu was also offered the still or sparkling trap and asked for regular water which they happily obliged

the bread was good and freshly made the asparagus soup was also good my main of lam rack was of a smaller portion 2 pieces though i didnt mind too much others may disagree and it seems they have here my chocolate sphere dessert was a larger portion and quite good as well

overall decent food and service not spectacular but not awful either, too stuffy it is an italian restaurant but trying to be fine dining
over priced
seafood soup  average broth was very watery
a ravioli type pasta which was like eating chinese dumplings
a desert which summed the meal up with dry ice
smoke and mirrors, i have been here three times in the past year because they were business dinners we ordered generously to make decent meal portions for most main courses are small service and ambiance are good as is food, well decorated and testy italian restaurant not so cosy as in italy but you are in shanghai the risotto was good but not exceptional foi gras also very classic but altogether a nice evening with your friends, vabene shanghai was gem of a find in shanghai it was located about a mile away from marriott tomorrows square in a very nice outdoor shopping and eating area the restaraunt was quite quaint and with great food nice portions and good value try the pizza and tiramisu, we ate here with 2 kids we had meat platter wine langoustine pasta lasagna pizza and casarcelli sort of ravioli and italian wine
good service was provided and since all was finished the food was good so very enjoyable, this is a nice quiet restaurant and the food was very good i chose mushroom risotto which was delicious and then lasagne which was a little bit stodgy for my liking my colleague had the sampling menu which was quite expensive at over 70 euros the meal and wines were very nice but i do think that it is rather overpriced i ate at another italian restaurant on the riverfront which was just as good but not nearly so expensive, the ambience of this restaurant is very nice its located in xitiandi however the italian food is normal not amazing and the price is in my opinios high, located in very nice and interesting xintiandi area though we arrived restaurant very near to their closing lunch time  yet we were given excellent service being vegetarian chefe paid very good attention and prepared nice pasta dish as per our request and was delicious dessert was also good, we dined at vabene on saturday night with a group of 21 whilst we had chosen a set menu and chose the wines we thought we knew what we were in for as soon as we sat down water was poured and continued to be topped up throughout the dinner no one asked for water but we were shocked at the end to find 2187rmb over $400 worth of water on the bill it was more expensive than the beer
the food was ok serving sizes of the main course very small but well presented service was good and atmosphere fine just a rude shock which spoilt the night
lesson learnt dont assume anything, we had a set menu for two at valentines day the overall food quality and its preparation was good but with respect to the price we expected more several issues really annoyed us 1 we asked for plain water but they only offered us expensive imported water 2 there was no amuse geule as teaser as i would have expected in that class of restaurant only a bread basket with butter and dip sauce 3 the prices for bottled wines with reasonable quality are ways too high 4 the courses were served as if we were in a fastfood restaurant about 30 minutes after we were seated the staff started to serve the third course we had to stop them to make sure we would not finish in one hour 5 the staff tried to take off the plate even before we finished the course point 4 and 5 made me thinking that the management speculates to get the tables occupied for a third time that eveningfinally 6 if you pay your bill by international credit card make sure that they charge in local currency and not in your homes currency i have not been asked though they should be obliged to do so and thus had to record a loss of > 11 eur due to this way of transaction, the restaurant is situated in xintiandi an intersting section old french concession  of shanghai small walkways with lots of restaurants and bars and close to the langman hotelthe waiters were good however the italian food not as good as in italy  as you would expect although my lasagna was excellent and tasty we did not have any wine so cannot comment, i had visit this place once again after a few years and even though is not bad the quality is not excelente as it use to be
still a ok option if you are around xitiandi, in the area of the french concession we found this resultant to be an excellent way to take a break from the ubiquitous chinese food associated on our tour it is down a busy alley off the main street in the area but worth looking for the food is basically italian as implied by the name and i found the lasagna almost as good as that served in my native rhode island my wifes salmon was also well done the wine list was extensive and not cheap and the service was brisk the clientele seemed to be mostly ex pats there are a lot of bard and restaurants in the area

at the end of the meal it started to rain and so we sat in the bar for a while the maitre d then kindly went into his lost and found and offered an umbrella so we could flag a cab in the conversation he noted that most of their ingredients were imported ie the lamb from nz

id go back the next time we are in shanghai, im writing this while im eating here the things that concern me are the fact that the butter appears to have been someone elses butter that they gave to me a single woman diner i will post a pic so you can see why i think this perhaps i dont rate fresh butter i got the pumpkin soup which was just fair and i asked for salt <u+8bf7><u+6211><u+8981><u+4e00><u+70b9><u+76d0> and the salt spoon was wet also weird im waiting for my salami pizza it just came thin crust okay not terrible not outstanding but im sorry i didnt do better research and go to t8 which is next door maybe thats dessert, went last year in june with chinese peopleit is in a nice shanghai zonexintiandithey asked me to select food to have a real italian experience so i drove them to a classic but original italian dinnereverything was wonderfulspecial mention to the fillet of beefreally at best starred italian restaurant leveland the dessert a chocolate sphere stuffed with ice cream and hot chocolate that make the sphere dissolve in an artistic scenevery creative anddelicious good wine listthe bill was a little high about 100 � each but overall highly recommendedespecially for those who does not love chinese foodlike me, a beautiful location and a classic european interior not stuffy or sterile which creates a sophisitcated relaxed dining experience the service quality is excellent the menu is reassuringly premium without being overpriced and most importantly the food and wine were divine

the restaurant manager miguel couldnt do enough for us which added to a fantastic experience i was there with my visiting parents however i also observed some happy couples and some softly spoken business meetings it is highly suitable for all of these occasions and is sure to impressperhaps not ideal for families with young children

��, dont be put off by the somewhat dodgy exterior it is a very authentic french brasserie with lots home home made products their foie gras chocolate mousse and pannacotta are fantastic and so is their onion soup although a little bit more cheese would be welcome and their creme brulee is out of this world it is a bit expensive

you can good authentic thai food in thousands of locations in shanghai this is an example of thai food subverted to the chinese local taste si if you want real thai food choose somewhere elseif its the locations and ambience your after is all here, fantastic thai cuisine loved the selection and the variety good service and atmosphere the tom yum soup is one the best ive ever had must try, my friend and i found this restaurant by chance while walking in the park at jingan temple area the food served at thai gallery was delicious we tried the spring rolls chicken honey and lemongrass yellow curry and chicken satay everything was really tasty and very well prepared we arrived early so we got a table at the deck with the relaxing view of the pond really recommend it, what a pleasure food is excellent you can get whether spicy or not
a lot of sea food or meat cooked in thailandese style
i recommend this restaurant close to jingan temple, best to book as it gets busy set looking over a pond in a small park near to the jingan temple the location could not be more beautiful on top of that the atmosphere is great and the is totally delicious great for a special occasion we went there on our last night we stayed in the french concession so this was close to our hotel and we walked past it everyday going to the metro station which is very nearby, this beautifully artistic designed restaurant  gallery is perfectly situated overlooking jingan temple park on the western section of nanjing road i highly recommend drinks and nibble here after a long day of exploring the urban landscape of shanghai you will appreciate the relaxing ambience and certainly find some flavorful tidbits to go with a cooling cocktail a cold beer or a chilled vino, obviously im not an expert but i did have plenty of thai meal over the years the food was up tommy expectations and tastet like the dishes you would get in thailand only the service was abut slow and not attentive but overall great experience, had dinner sunday evening before leaving in this fantastic location in the park opposite jin an temple very close to hilton hotel got table outside enjoyed watching the young hip crowd drinking and eating food was average and drinks were ok prices reasonable, the best thai restaurant in china simple as that amazing location great food and services thank you a+++++++++++, take my advice and dont listen to the reviews on here about mediocre food and service this place is awesome making the reservation was extremely easy on the website made and emailed in english with light speed response time and even though they had a busy saturday evening they were able to accommodate our party of 12 arrived early and had a drink at the bar when we arrived and waited for our table coconut republic  awesome we were seated right on time even though half of our party still had not arrived the ambiance is truly beautiful both inside and outside like a real art gallery and every detail has been carefully thought out from the decor the table topper and dishes even the menu which was very easy to read with tons of photos showing every item once the food and more drinks arrived we were in heaven  we ordered a ton of food any each thing was better than the next standouts for me were the creamy coconut soup pineapple fried rice roasted duck in red curry sauce and the fish in lime juice and chili for drinks my party loved the lychee martini we had like 20 of them also special shoutout to the thaiijito service was impeccable and there was always someone there to assist we really wanted to try dessert but ran out of room all in all a great dining experience that was thoroughly enjoyed by all a definitely must for anyone visiting shanghail, we visited this restaurant twice during our visit to jingan couldnt fault it the food was delicious with helpful but tastefully done photographs to help you choose service excellent and friendly reasonable price tag amazing art and decor perfect location and very comfortable chairs, thai gallery i found this place while strolling in jingan park one day with my husband since we already had our lunch that day the place looked so inviting to us that we saved this place in our mind for the next time we get thai food craving which we get most of the time it was the end of session for me and i remembered this place we went on a friday and the place was jam packed at 730 pm there were locals and also expats there is a small pond near the villa like restaurant where you can sit and enjoy the food we decided to sit by the pond and had to wait for around 20 minutes to get a table there but the waiting was not disappointing the food was 1010 and even the hospitality of the staff and also the owner they made us sit in the bar while waiting for the table and later the owner was cordial and humble to have a small talk with us we talked about milan and india the owner has a same restaurant named the same in milan as well do check out this place very nice and romantic , the legendary thai gallery has moved to a new spot in jingan park previously a balinese restaurant is this a good move

it seems like there is not much thought about the new place  they just moved right in with little no renovation or facelift needless to say this does not look anything like the art gallery that we were so used to what happened to all the beautiful artwork ok so maybe this is a new identity that needs some getting used to

service has imho deteriorated servers are not attentive and some even appeared uninterested

ordered my usual favourite dishes alas i felt they are not as delicious as before no

a good place for those who did not know the good old thai gallery for those who knew like me i wont be revisiting any time soon, thanks thai gallery
i want to write this review due my last night experience as everyone must try for at least one time in their time life to eat inside an art gallery
in fact the thai gallery is not just a thai restaurant but is as well an art gallery where while you are eating a delicious pad thai you can enjoy the contemporary furnitures and the outstanding art pieces
last night it was my 1st anniversary with my girlfriend which is from bank kong and it was my desire to bring her in a traditional but not boring thai restaurant so i opted for the thai gallery and yes it been the best choice i could make as soon as we entered the manager kindly welcomed us by making feeling us special in the exact way that you would like to feel in a important day such the 1st anniversary as i requested during my booking call he gave to us the best romantic table of the whole restaurant which made us so happy
the food was amazing and every dish was well presented in a new fresh way
the curry ships was very good and you could taste the coconut milk in the curry which i think is key my girlfriend which is really picky on thai food as shes thai approves all that we ate
as everyone knows happy wife happy night

so if you want to have a happy wife to enjoy your happy night thai gallery is the right place to be

top spot for a dinner with friends or family less so for a romantic date, excellent ambience for dinner you can choose either to enjoy your dining while sitting on the pillow or on the chair
tom yam gong is one of the best dishes, the highlight is the fit out of the restaurant interesting seating and artworks on the ground floor where we were seated dont be put off by the street frontage if you try the place in terms of the food i wouldnt rate it more than ok we shared several dishes none bad but nothing outstanding either pineapple rice tom yum soup a spicy whole fish sweet  sour pork thai bean sprouts etc were ok a highlight was the deserts the black rice with coconut was great the banana cake and a mango pudding dish were good too service was pretty good and the pricing reasonable

tip its nothing to do with the restaurant but be wary of the parking attendants trying to charge too much for parking outside we prepaid <u+00a5>35 for a spot on the roadside nearby when we departed just over 2 hours later the attendant tried to charge another <u+00a5>20 which we negotiated down to <u+00a5>10 when we collected the car by making it clear we didnt agree, + artfully decorated dining place that offers lots of phototaking opportunities both day and night
+ most of the dishes are good some are excellent
+ attentive service

 a bit out of the way located on a quiet street off west beijing road but very close to my apartment
 level 2 sit near the shoesoff sections at your own risk smell plus disturbance from patrons as they leave
 smoking is allowed on level 1 

i recommend two dishes which are consistently excellent
1 steamed fish
2 prawns  vermicelli in claypot, what a great little find food was great device efficient loved the masa man curry full of flavour  great venue full of colour and individuality , once we found the restaurant which is quite difficult to find we found the whole experience very satisfying trendy modern interior with well trained staff is what every restaurant in shanghai should have the food is brilliant really authentic and some of the best thai food ive had in shanghai, super fun and delicious thai place not far from our location at marriott tomorrow square

you take off your shoes and sit on these big cozy couches waiters are friendly and the place is too cool for school check out the dumbwaiter and the star trek doors

we love thai food and this was a great night out

note  if youre walking from the marriott grab an uber  it looks closer on the map than it is, thai gallery stands out from a setting point of view it has both smoking and non smoking areas it has both normal sitting tables and low sitting thai style lounges the food and drinks variety is very wide and prices are very acceptable count between 50 and 80 for every dish also around 50 for every appetizer dish
recommended, im a picky eater for the most part and im not adventurous when it comes to food at all my wife on the other hand is she dragged me to this place and what a surprise it was from the ambiance to the seating arrangement and the taste of food

i mean its not a high class luxurious restaurant and i did have to kind of ignore some things such as the stains on the seats i was not impressed at first but after getting my plate ive gone more than once

must try while youre in town, the food the services the atmosphere and the seating arrangement was just amazing  def going back again tomorrow it was perfect, best thai food ever eaten even in thailand  modern and classy decoration really comfortable and pleasant have been there for a birthday and so perfect  try the upstairs space and final argument  really cheap  40 to 70<u+00a5> for a dish  try the crab rice or the pineapple rice padthai and green curry are wonderful , i used to live across the street from thai gallery years ago in my memory it wasnt anything special and seemed subpar i went there yesterday for the first time in a couple years and it was much better than my memory the service was great the atmosphere is one of a kind the food was much better than it was before we ordered green curry pad thai and mixed vegetables typical thai dishes however the presentation especially the pad thai was exceptional they were all flavorful and delicious it cost 170rmbish without drinks 280rmb with trust me it wont be 2 years before we return again, went together with a couple of friends in an evening amazed by the funky interior and ambience staffs were welcoming and helpful

ordered their signature thai green curry with chicken which was very good
lime and herb steam fish was refreshing in taste
had a few appetizers such as the prawn waffles very nice vegetable spring rolls and chicken in leaf wraps

also i recommend to try their special drinks i had their thai sago and black jelly with milk in crushed ice which was very tasty indeed, quite large restaurant a bit hidden from the crossing but easy to find modern and nice interior and good food not to many dishes with red curry though, went with a friend classic thai dishes not as authentic as thailand but were in shanghai after all great minamilist decor  concrete but with thai accents that transcend staff  service level were above average good place for a chililemongrassbasil fix and not unbearably noisy well be back reminded us of the drink gallery in koh samui, we sat in the sitting on the floor section which is really nice the atmosphere and music is buddha bar like the card is big and very thai with great soups and curries the food is 5 star thai but they are bad at syncronising the dishes which means someone always is eating alone around the table we had to ask twice for some of the dishes dont pick the spare ribs  it is not spare ribs  rather mc nugets price value is excellent, the thai gallery was a lovely restaurant with an upstairs and downstairs seating area the downstairs is a smoking area and the smoke did travel to the upstairs a nonsmoking zone overall we enjoyed our evening the cocktails and the food were really tasty there were a few options for vegetarians my husband is vegetarian and managed to choose a few dishes no problem the place is really well themeddecorated with a choice of raised or sunken seats that look like youre sitting on the floor but you arent, a very fun atmosphere to go to especially if you get a table where there are cushions the food however is average typically thai food should be more flavorful and not so greasy unfortunately our dishes were neither flavorful and were greasy they also seemed to run out of certain dishes and desserts while we were there lots of great restaurants in shanghai this one unless you really want some sort of thai food is not necessarily one of them one last thing  we had to ask several times before we would get our drinks refills etc, ok in shanghai there is a lot of chinese food but unfortunately most is not suitable for vegetarians even the stuff you think may be ok isnt so it was great to have a meal i could totally relax with and trust to be vegetarian

what a very tasty meal it was

the place is beautifully and tastefully decorated very modern yet comfortable
the food was delicious and was probably one of the nicest thai yellow curries i have had

great to have a change from chinese food too

highly recommended and not far off the main drag behind shanghais famous handbag haggling superstore  580 nanjing road, this is quite some place the food is outstanding and setting is different but then again it is a gallery

caters for both meat and non meat eaters

choise of seating at a table or comfortable riased seating area which looks like you are sitting on the floor but you sit in a footwell

enjoyed the food and would recommended going again, typically i dont like thai food outside of thailand but the food here was pretty good it was comfortable to sit on the couches with the pillows which provided a more cozy experience everything we ordered was really good and fresh the massaman curry was good but the pork in the curry didnt taste so great it seemed pretty fatty but we couldnt really tell because it was quite coated in the curry the green curry was excellent, i was recommended to visit this restaurant by a thai friend living in shanghai and have to say that the food and service is good price is also okay so recommend anyone to try, been coming back again and again to this restaurant and nothing compares to itall through the years they maintained the best quality of food and service that is why i kept coming back whether its a family or with my dear one whenever he visits shanghai thai gallery is always on our list from the moment you enter the establishment youll find yourself in a different worldvery distinctive and captivating i never failed to recommend this restaurant whenever friends or meet new acquaintances asks about good restaurants and everyone agrees that am right about thai gallery, from the minute you walk in your not in shanghai absolutely stunning restaurant 2 floors with ambiance to burn service is fantastic views are beautiful and meals are more than enough not often i leave food on a plate but between 3 of us we couldnt finish it all when the check came it was also a pleasant supprise  rmb 320 for 3 people here in the middle if shanghai  outstanding last but not least even the toilets are so good  automatic doors  stunning artwork and clean i could not recommend this restaurant enough thanks a lot to boogle hope that is spelt right brilliant waitress who knows her stuff, i really loved the decor of this resturant it truly feels like you are eating at a gallery however the food is only fair i am huge fan of thai food i found that the food did not have very strong thai flavors one thing i hate about some resturants is that they would bring the main course before the appetizer this happened and we had to send the main back because it got cold the service is also only fair, we had the tom yum soup which was spicy but good my companion had a fish main course that was nicely prepared and the grilled prawns with yellow curry were amazing with the pineapple rice we paired our thai dishes with singha beer which was a little pricey and had a mango dessert which was the perfect way to end the meal the service was fast and friendly and dinner for two was about 400 rmb i love the thai art the flora and the lighting creating a mystical ambience if you are near the peoples square this is a must try for thai cuisine they text you the address in chinese after you book your reservation which i thought was a nice touch as you can just show it to the taxi driver, the atmosphere was great the food was one of the best in shanghai the waiter gomer provided excellent service a hit in the jingan temple area with a lot of great restaurants, i eat at the bali laguna restaurant regularly and it has become my favourite shanghai venue so it was with great expectations that i decided to visit its sister restaurant the thai garden the restaurant is open plan in a pleasant neoindustrial building with unpainted concrete and exposed services it doubles as an art gallery and the pictures make for a pleasant back drop the noise generated by the other diners is ear splitting as the acoustics are dreadful a little sound absorbing material in between the reinforced concrete roof members would not detract from the minimalist intentions of the designer and would make for a quieter environment or perhaps it is intentional and the management are keen to be rid of us as soon as possible so that they may hand our table to the next victims

we were shown to a table on the mercifully nonsmoking second floor and perused the menu which looked good although i had to use the torch on my phone in order to see the menu courtesy of the very subdued lighting one of our party is vegetarian and she was pleased with the selection of suitable dishes we ordered drinks and waited and waited but had to order again before they arrived the beer and prosecco were both warm and so we had to wait for them to cool in an ice bucket before they reached a drinkable temperature in the meantime we ordered our food and it began to arrive after a further wait but then this is a busy restaurant and one must be tolerant

when the dishes did arrive however they were all stone cold the waitress took away the rice microwaved it for a few seconds and represented it still cold we mentioned the problem to the waitress and she said that she would �warm it up� we asked to speak to the manager he was suitably contrite and when i asked if i should leave or would he like to try again he took the second option we waited again then pints of beer arrived on the table �compliments of the management� we were told now this really is an insult neither my female guest nor i drink beer we were drinking prosecco and it does not mix with huge mugs of draught lager the food eventually returned to the table and was mostly passable the red curry with duck particularly good but everything else was average and not sufficiently spicy or thai flavoured to be anything but mediocre

a very disappointing experience but as this establishment comes so highly recommended by other ta reviewers i shall give it another chance and try again who knows perhaps my next review will prove to be excellent, great thai food in a buzzing atmosphere with good service stylish restaurant in cbd the thai staff are very pleasant and happy to give their recommendations using their help saves trying to use the menu boards that are a bad idea unwieldy esp as the low light means you need to manoeuvre them under the candlelight the food was very good portion side about right, ambiance and decor were top notch the food was very good but not amazing i would definitely recommend this place although it was marginally overpriced, this has a lovely ambience while art plays a prominent part in the restaurant which add a lot of character to this place
being a vegetarian ive been told that even in veg dishes shrimp and fish sauces are used in most restaurangs across china these guys ensured that none of that was a part of our meal which was just what we wanted the food quality too was exceptionally good

mostly busy always so best to plan ahead and make your reservations, thai gallery is a great restaurant located in an artgallery setting very good selection and large menu food is excellent particulary papaya salad and spring rolls the service is really outstanding very friendly and attentive without being annoying price is also very good paricularly for shanghai would definitely highly recommend, staff speak english and it is really kind
there is a smoking area airdownstair and a non smoking on the second floor and wifi
you can seat at tables or at foutons some tables have a paper tablecloth that you can paint with colored pencils other tables are moe formal
the light and music is really relaxing
you can order many dishes with crab and prawns
the big portion of fruit is too big for 2, if you are looking to impress somebody with a nice evening night this will be the perfect place when you go there you will know what i was talking aboutnice decoration low lights nice service excellent food, thai food in an art gallery super food nicely present on the middle of popart paintings  surreal good business dinner location","Taiwanese cuisine",0.999743665462308
105,"the group that performs nightly is absolutely fantastic my coworkers and i had a wonderful time singing along and chatting with a couple of the band members the pizza was pretty good but the bar ran out of corona staff is wonderful as was my experience in every area of the kerry, we used to go to the brew all the time although pricy generally enjoyed it food quality and service started to go down hill so stopped going tonight went back waited over 30 min for someone to wait on us not busy also had a table fiasco just trying to switch to a better table basically we will never go back service poor and food just so so skip it and find a better place, excellent brewery on site recommend the pills ipa and the mash happy hour until 8 live music most nights, we went to the brew before and found decent service good beer and tasty food
when we returned yesterday evening we were shocked the staff did barely speak english we waited 25 minutes for our chicken satay sticks and the pizza arrived even later and burned to charcoal  inedible
we were offered a new one but since the kitchen was very busy we might have to wait for another 25 minutes asked what was going on this evening we were told that they have a big group that eveningclearly they were not able handle to handle that plus regular customers
very disappointing and we will think twice before returning, it locates at the first floor of the hotel just in the left side of the hotel front desk i like the live band here the price is also a bit lower than i expecut it is very recommended to spend some quality time with friends after a long day of work it is also nice if you go outside in the camp if it is nice <u+9152><u+5427><u+5750><u+843d><u+65bc><u+98ef><u+5e97><u+5927><u+5ef3><u+6ac3><u+81fa><u+5de6><u+5074><u+3002><u+6211><u+975e><u+5e38><u+559c><u+611b><u+9019><u+88e1><u+7684><u+73fe><u+5834><u+6f14><u+594f><u+6a02><u+968a><u+975e><u+5e38><u+6703><u+5531><u+4e14><u+5e36><u+52d5><u+73fe><u+5834><u+6c23><u+6c1b><u+3002><u+9910><u+9ede><u+9152><u+985e><u+50f9><u+4f4d><u+4f4e><u+65bc><u+6211><u+7684><u+9810><u+671f><u+3002><u+5728><u+4e00><u+5929><u+8f9b><u+52e4><u+7684><u+5de5><u+4f5c><u+5f8c><u+6211><u+975e><u+5e38><u+63a8><u+85a6><u+548c><u+670b><u+53cb><u+5230><u+9019><u+88e1><u+4f86><u+3002>, this place is great to hang out at night for drinks or just even for a quick lunch or dinenr it has a greta atmosphere and the staff is friendly, if i would not have been invited to a function at that place i would not have been there the beers are of average quality they make a mediocre cider there and declare it as beer the food abuffet was very good there was very loud live music on the evening of my visit not recommended for beer lovers, yes they brew their own beer yes some of it is excellent the service is really good

but the foodoh my word there should be an award for extra bad 

on my 1st visit they burnt my pizza

on my 2nd try they burnt my tasteless dry very poorly put together and served without a napkin or cutlery nachos

bad bad bad i fail to understand why the food in the kerry is consistently poor

this is a shangri la hotel but its an extremely poor relation to those i have dined in

if you want a beer and a band youre set anything more go to the blue frog in the mall next door, i walked by the bar to the elevator and the band was playing wish you were here by pink floyd i thought how appropriate, brew pub so best to like beer the skinny  lager was best for lager drinkers  live band and great atmosphere western prices, they have a wonderful range of beersales with a micro brewery on site although i didnt see it in action the food isnt the best but it has a good vibe and friendly manager some evenings they have live bands, nothing to say about the all you can eat buffet  you can choose between 8 different type of cuisines from sushi to french fries 
nothing also to say about the service and the restaurant by itself
the only thing is that we are just in a shopping center and not with seaview on the bund so when you get a 330 yuan bil  which mean 45 euros  50 usd  then it s surprising 
so you can go  but don t forget you will pay for it, i visited this place almost every night nice beers and nice local singers enjoyed this place, soulless hotel bar with a bad band on the night i went horrendously expensive for average beer in a poncy plastic cup i would never go back avoid at all costs why people might go here unless they were staying at the hotel on business is beyond me, located in ground floor of kerry hotel and colocated with nice shopping center the brew is a nice place to grab some western style food and drinks happy hour is bogo on their home brewed beers which i like very much pils ipa stout etc rmb 68 for a pint + one free food is mostly western and much of it is deep fried but they have good salads and pizza is surprisingly good comedy acts dj or bands on most weekend nights and there is a pool table lots of televisions playing regional sports can be a bit noisy so escape to outdoor seating if you need to overall a nice place to hang with friends, the food and service is good and we like the beer and the place was nice very relax to meet friends, usually quite good but somewhat spectacularly out of touch tonight not particularly busy but able to bring my food out cold and then magma level hot after i complain then i get staff arguing next to me between themselves for 20 minutes on organisational issues  im here to relax not listen to who didnt collect the bill from whom still confident enough to include a service charge which says that they probably dont know whats going on given the 5 people that tried to serve me this evening for the same things, this was the closest bar in the hotel after a boring day at the conference so it was packed in the evenings the drinks are good and so are the bar snacks theres also a live band belting out popular western numbers on most nights, not really though maybe be better great cider excellent snacks and a good band service is sometimes slow

if you are staying in the hotel it is a must, we dropped in here while staying at the hotel for a late evening drink and a snack it was a holiday chinese valentines day and extremely busy but i give the staff credit for keeping up fairly well

the food is quite good for western food in china i enjoyed some nachos as a snack they have a variety of craft beers brewed in house and you can try them all in a flight if desired

the place can be loud and boisterous but i think that adds to the atmosphere allinall we had a good time, beer should not be served in plastic cups that do not fit your hand please bring back the glass  that frosts  and sweats also they are not 500ml, always a great place for meeting friends the staff is great and treats me like family always with a smile the house band is always great party atmosphere during the weekend love this place, service is good and food was good  music was fantastic  chicken wings was very good and beer had different kinds it was very good  happy is good coz everyday, the name of the brew says it all the beer selection is the high point of the restaurant it is loud in the evening food is ok but nothing to brag about good spot for late night with friends, the atmosphere is trying to be a pub with a chinese dj during happy hour the food was mediocre i do not like beer so i cannot comment on that but they make beer on site here, located in the kerry hotel this place is fantastic had a great dinner and lots of beers with a large group of colleagues food service and of course the beer excellent, ive been going tothe brew for years now live in jinqiao not ten minutes away and have always encountered excellent service and food but that has changed my last three trips to the brew this spring has resulted in subpar performance by the waiterwaitress staff ie long waits for someone to take an order long waits for drinks longer waits for the food the management has changed smiles are gone efficiently has decreased this should not be the case in a high class hotel like the kerry center food is still good but bring back the high quality service because really shanghai has a lot to offer in the ways of good food come on brew you can do better, while the place is called the brew they still have wine on the menu and could not serve of the bottle we asked for disappointing and not the first time youd think theyd hire more english speaking servers considering the majority of the foreigner clientele i had a hot dog once here also disappointing the burger however was a great option despite the fact that is was about $20usd i would probably never say oh im in the mood for the brew but if theres an event i happen to be there for im quite happy its there friend had fish and chips and was pleased check out the whole area to see if inside or outside suits you best apparently theyve got live music during certain times in the evenings depends what you like, quite a selection of micro brews and snacks service was a little slow but friendly first time to find nachos in asia with jalapenos as well steak sandwich meat is a little tough so hard to eat in hand but still tasty, this is a very nice and impressive beer bar which is making their own beer they also have a nice band the staff is very nice, good bar but service is a bit slow and haphazard when it gets busy food was good great band and great atmosphere when the place is pumping, prefer the outdoor area a lot of late night vultures looking for boyfriends sugar daddies even johns in a group okay but i would not get drunk here alone a little creepy, i stopped here for a lunch meeting they tried to seat is in the tented area but this was hot and stuffy so we asked to moved indoors the place was noise with people but not so noisy we could not have a conversation we had the a burger and salmon salad both were good in addition i had an ipa which they brewed themselves and it was good they also offered a small free sampling of apple cider other than that they left us alone to work, like all the other reviewers have mentioned they make their own beerbut also they make a mean cidera razor back ciderlove the stuff it goes well with the chicken basket dish suggest you try a paddle a sampler of their beers

on nights when they have a live band which is typically very good it does get loudso head for the back room, nice place to try craft beer and dine with friends business associates or family there are many events held at this place and would surely recommend if you stay at the kerry park hotel look for fanni she is one of the best and most friendly server you can find go before 8pm to enjoy the 11 drink happy hour, if you come for the service then forget it tons of waiters don t manage customers they forget your orders they don t deliver in good sequence the food are just ok and overpriced if you compare with other restaurants in this area, nice cozy place good location close to alot of restaurants the beer is from their own brewery we order a set of six different beer so you coyld taste the difference worth a visit, place to unwind and relax after a whole day meeting enjoyed the music band a lot cool place to meet other travelers and new friends try their local beer its good, checked in a little late and was surprised how good the brew is good service good beer selection and good food had caesar  salmon which was good reasonably priced definitely try if u r in the area, i have been here now two times and i like it very much they have a good selection of beers and the service is quick and good the have a pool table as well, really nice place to have a drink however service is unbelievably slow dont bother eating here unless you dont mind waiting an hour for a burger when the place is empty problem is i think that although adequately staffed its down to 3 or 4 people doing the work the others swan round like they are bosses not sure they need so many bosses the quality of service is actually very good
a shame really as my colleagues and i have basically given up on the place blue frog is cheaper and service is really fast, went to have some beers with my friends had an amazing night tried the tasting paddles which is a tasting of all their craft beers also the chicken wings are amazing and the live music is great
definitely a place to go if you love beer, the brew at kerry hotel a great bar near in exhibition center and best to unwind after work i try all thier craft beer and i iike the indian pale ale and wheat beer this two beer with awesome taste and quality also put in a unique glass the food was also great especially the brewery burger nachos and chicken wings with excellent and attentive service from all staff at the brew, they have a great brewery on site with good selection of different styles of biers i prefer the white ant the wait staff is very energetic and quick to refresh your beverage
the food is also good with many western and local varieties
there is live music that is good and will take requests to play your favorite music and get the party started, service very slow and you have to proactively track down the server to get serviceto order and to pay food just average and drinks just ok although they do have a few good specialty beerson their menu, the place is full of friendly expats the vibe is amazing specially when the live music is playing food is good you should definitely try their beer tasting sample service is friendly and i would definitely go back there next time, the brew pub was a highlight of my 4 day stay at the kerry
tried many styles but mostly stuck with the classic ipa well crafted and the local house band was excellent, the best bar in town the brewin kerry hotel have nice food excellent service they are true friendly and im very like the famous they called testing paddle they have seven kinds of beerperfect, this is the best craft beer in shanghai and you can try everything in one visits just order the famous tasting paddle the glass was also unique nice atmosphere nice ambiance and easy to communicate to all the staff and they are with good english communication skills friendly and attentive service, perfect spot to unwind after a day at the exhibition centre good beer good service good food and a few pool tables","Italian cuisine",0.924737020165718
106,"visited for colleagues for a work dinner recommend the chile verde margarita churros corn lollipops corn scallops soup and fish tacos good service yummy food and fun atmosphere, the atmosphere was nice they played natalia lafourcade while i was there so i had a great time we had tacos and guacamole and chips the decor is kinda trendy the place a bit small but cozy a great place, el luchador was amazing small quaint atmosphere wait staff was very attentive food came out fast and hot everything was delicious i had the fajitas best ive ever had i traveled china for two weeks on business and this was the best meal of my entire trip, best tacos i got the chorizo tacos good heat great cheese and the way they are made are revolutionary, i found this restaurant my last night in shanghai
the food was excellent i ordered the beef fajitas and a frozen mango margarita
although i thought the portion size was a bit small the food was delicious and cooked to perfection

the inside was crowded so i sat at one of the tables outside i briefly met the owner who i believe is from mexico if not mexico central america so you know that the food is cooked with authentic flavors and by following authentic recipes

this restaurant does not offer complimentary chips and salsa, weve been to both locations for el luchador and dont really know what all the fuss is about this has been shanghais darling mexican food spot for a while but the prices are really too high and portions too small the drinks will cost as much as your food and both will leave you going to the family mart afterwards if this is the benchmark place for mexican then taco bell is going to get a michelin star many other spots are better and have more value, we saw el luchador walking around xintiandi and decided to try it we were a little put off when we called the waiter and he shouted wait so we did for five minutes or so i turned around and saw him laughing with the bartender i called another waiter who took our order we ordered the nachos with carnitas the beef quesadilla and a frozen lime margarita

the drink was ok it wasnt great quality tequila the nachos came without the carnitas we asked and the manager quickly rectified the problem we wished that he hadnt the carnitas were not great just salty and wet they made the chips really soggy also very little real cheese was used instead they used three kinds of sauces most of what was on the plate tasted like it was from a can or a jar nothing fresh or authentic the quesadillas were soggy on the outside but the australian beef was surprisingly good the portion sizes were also small considering the prices although the margarita was competitively priced

overall the food was pretentious and lacked the rustic authenticity of real mexican food we wont be returning, good mexican food in shanghai the service was good they let us be when we wanted to enjoy the conversation with each other but also were available if we needed them  paid 140<u+00a5> about $10 usd for 2 burritos that were fairly small happy hour drinks were decently priced if youre looking for a good margarita you will find it here, we had a fantastic evening at this restaurant we had a starter main and dessert and we were very satisfied i was particularly impressed because i am a vegetarian and they had several options for me to choose from we felt the price was very reasonable the portion sizes were ample overall it was a very good evening out, found this place wondering around the place itself is not as big inside but acceptable the food is really really amazing try their burritos fajitas nachos or their margaritas all purely mexican as being a mexican food lover this is the best we can find in the town and the pricing is fair enough toodont miss to try this when you are in shanghai, the food is good and consistent however portions are a little small nice for a light lunch a very relaxed atmosphere both the yongkang lu and xintiandi locations are very similar, as a mexican i can say is the only truly mexican food in china if you want to know how real mexican food tastes you must come here if you visit shanghai is a rule to go there

mexicanos que estan lejos del sabor de su hogar el luchador es el lugar indicado si quieren recordar el verdadero sabor de la comida mexicana de calidad

this is not a cheap place are there any in this complex  but i didnt mind as the food drinks and atmosphere were all great to excellent
food presentation is on par with the taste and we had the best churros ever
id highly recommend this restaurant, dont expect fast service but the food is great and worth the wait

aim to sit upstairs if you can

clearly you need to sample at least a few of the margarita flavors on offer, lot of tourists but we are in yongkang road so that is expected but an excellent place to grab a bite and have a few cocktails or cold beers fast and nice service great food and enough folks to chat with will visit again soon, located in the french concession area makes it a great place for people watching had the corn lollypops quesadillas tuna tacos and nachos everything was great coronaritas and margaritas were also really good, im not a usual fan for mexican food but i do opt for tapas very often if not once or twice a month this place is more of spanish tapas than anything local or ordinary mexican food food quality creativity inspiration decoration are top notch and you can just tell how much thoughts and care put into the food i got a chance to visit the kitchen where it was totally sterile organized and coordinated ingredients are extremely fresh and many of the spice of unique ingredient are flown in from mexico everything was beyond word and i came back immediately the second day  service is superb and impressive staff are chilled yet attentive always know what you are looking for theres a reason why this place is so expensive not only its location but also the food and creativity behind it average person is around $50 usd, went here on a sunday night with friends we sat down right awaygood service nice outdoor seating as well located in xintiandi the cocktails were fairly priced and goodwe decided on an assortment of startersthe mushroom fundido is a must have we had to order another one it was so good, been mexican there are not too many places around shanghai to have authentic flavors and recently went to this place but at xintiandi
so to start prices indeed are higher but certainly not what i would consider crazy for a family of 3 we paid around 600 rmbs including drinks and lots of food so i would say ok for the shanghai std in this area certainly not when youre in a budget
about the food i was surprised about the flavors the carnitas or the barbacoa tacos guacamole or the jamaica water certainly remind me home
regarding presentation nice somehow fancy like for the gorditas in small bites but i have to accept that everything we tried was really good
for a dessert try the churros
place is medium size attention is great lalo is a great person that explain us the whole menu and even made some modification to a couple of dishes so my daughter could eat them
fyi most of the raw materials are imported it was said by lalo that is due to the questionable quality of the local so to assure top quality they import most of the things i appreciated the final result, great place excellent location and really good food always make a beeline for this place when on yklgood feed descent pricing and excellent service, this place has the best of both worlds the best mexican food in town and the best location on the new shanghai bars street ask for eduardo the owner he will recomend you the best of the best, we arrive there around 930 and still almost all tables are occupied and it was thursday we order tacos burritos and quesadilla cheese all food are amazing as well as the mango soda drink i dont know exactly the taste of a mexican food but for me it was really good with a great location in the corner of yongkang lu with a cross street of xiang yang lu, the food was good enough it somewhat reminded me of the mexican food i can get back at home in california the service was good but a tad slow the drinks were good for the price we paid, really nice location on yongkang lu the burritos were great and the coronarita did not disappoint however i thought i didnt get enough chips when i ordered the nachos, yongkang lu is a mustvisit if youre into drinking day or night and el luchador is the perfect place to grab a bite to eat it has 2 floors and a few small tables outside for peoplewatching and enjoying the sun however it can get very busy so perhaps book in advance i think the food is fantastic  i have no idea if its authentic mexican street food or not  but i dont really care either way as it tastes great, we have been to both el luchador locations in shanghai if you are looking for a fun bar experience then yong kang is your better bet if you want a nice dining experience with better quality food the xtd location does not disappoint yes it cost more but i believe you get what you pay for at the xtd location you are paying for quality taste experience and creativity you get all three give it a try, we have been at the new location at xintiandi and were totally disappointed the food is good but nothing special the price however is ridiculous eg almost 10� for a few tortilla chips with dip is just a ripoff also all the other dishes have a crazy price compared to what you get

there are so many places which are better than this, fresh and interesting and better than us style mexican fresh flat taco plates fajhitas interesting small plates and of course good drinks and beer better food than the rest of this block long expat bar street i live nearby and come here often for a light meal with a clean fresh taste and lime on the side small cafe but also a room upstairs with more tables only two blocks from iapm mall, especially good to go on the weekend where they have all you can drink margaritas for around 150 kuai nice atmosphere and al fresco dining also possible, food is great and the atmosphere is awesome come in have some drinkssnacks and take in the vibe if you dont have fun then you just suck, went with friend for a few drinks the lamb tacos were the best i have tried in shanghai really like mexican food margarita section and flavor are great, reminiscent of california mexican food this place hits the mark on good basics like burritos and tacos the baja fish tacos are best similar to the ones in south baja san felipe carnitas are flavored well

avoid the guacamole just horrible flavor likely not made fresh as avocados are hard to source for a real authentic guac, el luchador is located in a nice spot on the street corner so its a nice spot to watch the world go by the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable although you may want to book in advance if theres a group of you 4+

service was ok and staff were pleasant food arrived in the usual ad hoc manner that tends to be the norm in shanghai we ordered a mixture of tacos and burritos and the food was tasty and well presented my criticism of the food here is the portion size as you dont get a lot for your money otherwise its a reasonable place to grab a bite to eat

price wise youre looking at about 65rmb for a burrito 30rmb for a single taco and bottled beers range from 40 to 60rmb depending if its happy hour or not

for the most part i enjoyed our visit and im sure at some point well return but sadly it wont make my top ten list for shanghai, nice place on the famous yongkang lu food is straight and easy portions are big and service super good, nice bar with very good service yummy margaritas and total atmosphere is funky food is authentic tasting and very well priced, the mexican food there is excellent best mexican dish in town i would say if you go there dont miss the chance to drink one of their tequila based cocktails they really serve high quality drinks and if you dont have to work the next day try the coronarita magarita with a bottle of corona my favorite drink there when it comes to cocktails, best kept secret in shanghai staff is friendly and accommodating food presentation is amazing and the margaritas are silky smooth chefowner eduardo takes a simple burrito and creates a delicious and scrumptious dish mexican food done right, fantastic mexican food the best in shanghai try the tacos and quesadillas the best margaritas in the city and wonderful staff i highly recommend this place, nice place for tacos and beer in the expat area of shanghai i would give it 5 stars but the tortillas break apart while eating the tacos still good, while theres nothing like a good margarita great mex food is really hard to find and shows up in so many forms

this tequila bar makes their margaritas w lemon juice which tho sourced from mexico supposedly still does not have the crisp tart taste that a good margarita needs theres great choice for types of margaritas based on quality of tequila  but the call drinks can get pricier than expected

el luchadors version of mex food was not what i expected in terms of quality nor presentation but then again ive been to many really good mexican restaurants in both california and mexico  all more authentic, i simply love this bar tequila and tacos how can you go wrong the food is great and the atmosphere is fun situated on yongkang lu the weekend night life is so great especially during summer  although i dont remember leaving because some one gave me to much tequila i definitely remember arriving give it a try, enjoyed the beef chicken and pork in various configurations of burritos and tacos pretty darn good the corn tortillas were a little stale but hey just getting corn tortillas is a chore even in shanghai, i stopped into el luchador on sunday afternoon their affable chef eduardo told us that they were unfortunately closed but agreed to open for margaritas first off the interior design for me was a big plus downstairs the walls are emblazoned with masked wrestlers on exposed brick it reminded me of the oldtimey advertisements fading on the brick exteriors of buildings in the american west upstairs was quieter and offered a better option for a conversation

the margaritas are terrific as we got there before they were officially open we had to start off on the rocks but as their frozen machine cooled down we were able to transition to the frozen variety both are excellent and dare i say better than cantina agave the frozen variety was a personal favorite of mine i enjoyed how finely the ice was chopped and the perfect pairing of booze and mix

i was also here the other night for food i tried all of the tacos available one of the burritos nachos and quesadillas everything was fairly good they take a different approach to their chips as they seem to have a thick cut and are seasoned with red pepper if you liked the tacos at mi tierra you�ll love el luchador they are pretty much made in the same form this is not surprising as the chef cut his teeth there and at mexo at the bund i�m really looking forward to the mole offerings down the road, right at the entrance of yongkang road sits this mexican restaurant the margaritas were good but very expensive for what it is skip the other 2 for 1 margaritas special as it is really an ice slurpie we decided to try some tacos and guacamole with an added beef but was disappointed to see that it came like a bowl of rice small portion no salsa at all and guacamole was barely a teaspoonful the added beef was more a seasoning rather than actual beef that was not a great introduction to what was to come and we decided to cut our losses and left disappointing when a mexican restaurant cannot even provide basic chips  guacamole  salsa like the rest of the reviews dont think the food is anything to hold your breath about skip it, the dishes are sometimes diverging from classic interpretation but always in a good sense i did visit the place twice, love the food nice portion size good selection beers are cold great atmosphere and people watching spot highly recommended, the restaurant is in a hip spot with a lot of bars and restaurants with expats the restaurant is nice and the service is quite good as a mexican food lover and expat i was excited for the food which others recommended highly i feel you can usually judge a lot by the quality of a places salsa and chips and both were pretty disappointing and not very flavorful the verde was quite poor the tacos were alright but i was hoping for much better flavor and options no lingua or barbacoa was a let down hot sauce options were minimal was hoping for cholula at least good drinks and a friendly staff were the highlights,  great buzz when the singer was singing soon dipped when she stopped good food for a quick mexican fix

worth a visit, seriously i dont see how it gets better than this i have tried the nachos the tacos the quesadillas and fajitas everything was fabulous i have been to other mexican restaurants in shanghai and i was already quite satisfied but this was way above my expectations the food is just so fresh and well prepared the galletas are crispy and warm they put plenty of cheese and meat and marinated ingredients it was amazing the only downside is the service wasnt great both waiters that attended our table looked unhappy and were almost impolite but its no big deal when the foods that good","Cantonese cuisine",0.999806644639467
107,"you get quite the experience though its not exactly hard to find the way to get in is mostly noticeable as long as you know the right store to walk in the first level of this speakeasy is way too crowded the drinks are very interesting and some good some bad the next level of this speakeasy is just the right amount of comfort people and atmosphere so if you get there put your name on the list early wait it out and head to the second level worth it once but i cant see myself becoming a regular here which this place is filled to max capacity with regulars, we loved this place you enter through the shop ocho and the guy behind the till opens the secret door behind the bookcase we walked through the secret passage and up to the stairs to the bar it was very busy even on a tuesday night at 2130 we managed to find a spot for three or us and ordered our cocktails they were all fantastic if you wish to go up to the next floor your will have to put your name on the waiting list ask the lady at the bottom of the stairs we asked and she said it was full but after about 20 mins she came over to us and said she had three spaces upstairs if we still wished she took us up the stairs to another secret bar which looks amazing only seating for about 20 people hence the waiting list the drinks in this bar are a little more expensive still reasonable by uk standards but are more elaborate and fancy you must try this place we will be back on our next visit, i ve been there in january with friends there you have firstto find the entry door secret at first floor you have a large bar  i recommend to sit a the bar jaoanese bar tenders with high knowledge price are high for shanghai atmospere is cool relax you can chat the cocktail card is not huge but you can always talk and ask for something special
a second floor a second room only if once more you find how to open it i did not try the food  but you can also eat, by the time i get to this asia top 50 i had been around the for a bit i was still in search of my palette in this city something i do everywhere i go  to find a comfort zone i can have a tipple and i found it right here at speak low

being asia top 50 it also meant it wasnt easy to get through the doors of this speakeasy over my two weeks stay in shanghai i had figured out the best timing to come and also when to just bite the bullet and wait it out knowing that it will all be worth it at the night of the night i started with orders off the menu and i moved on to doing my usual at every cocktail bar  throw the bartender i like at first sight a bespoke challenge most of them here at speak low have scored with super flying colours kris du and yumi together with upandcoming kevin are my favourite stars that can ever align behind the bar

kris is officially my palette in shanghai he made me the more than 30 bespokes with just gin alone over just the few nights i have met him on shift record breaking compared to everyone i have ever met combined just for gin alone he introduced me to new gins he had used as the base other than my usual hendricks range of sipsmith and monkey he had also surprised me very much with the ones he made with rum and whiskies whisky cocktails are never my thing cos they were never made with good understanding but kris did it i was impressed by his humility and fire in his eyes whenever i ask for a bespoke i love to meet a mixologist who is bursting with ideas and so dying to put their knowledge and theories outside the menu to surprises you will never expect and it had came to a point all i had to do is tell kris which gin i want and he will do the rest all with a mutual understanding of palette

yumi is from japan and i love how graceful and elegant she is over the bar she definitely has defined a style she can call her own and she totally pulls if off she is beautiful to watch as she goes into action making drinks she does the regulars better than the others  its funny how the same recipes made by different people can taste differently i have had glasses of bespoke good vibes from her too

a friend of mine told me i cant hide all the hot bartenders i met and i would say most of the best ones in shanghai  boys and girls are all here at speak low kris yumi takumi fayeall the most beautiful people you can ever ask for on the other side of the bar at the same time, we went here on the review of a friend best cocktails weve had in our lives and possibly ever will have it gets busy but its well worth the wait or having to stand up great atmosphere and every single drink was a hit between the 4 of us we tasted a good majority of the drinks on the menu and each one was without fault our bartender chris was super busy making up cocktails with precision but still found the time to chat to us and was very attentive he even gave us some other recommendations at the end would recommend ordering off the menu but they can also make anything else you want well worth the prices great service, visited this place on christmas eve with some friends after hearing rave reviews

it was unbelievably busy i understand it was christmas eve but there comes a point you have to stop letting customer after customer come in and allow the cramped sardines inside the chance to enjoy the facility

i think if it was less crowded it could be an awesome place what did disappoint me was the limited festive drinks list at around 95rmb per drink i was expecting so much more very disappointed after all of the great reviews i had heard from friends in the city

i would consider returning as this may have been one of the worse nights to attend but i must leave feedback based on my experience, it used to be tough to find the bar as it was styled after a speakeasy think hidden doors nowadays they have been attracting a large crowd and the fun of finding the place is gone

but the cocktails are amazing each floor has a different menu set my personal favourite is the menu on the 3rd floor to get access up you would have to ask the hostess if there are any seats upstairs and either wait for a table or go right on up there is also an elusive 4th floor which is solely for regulars

suggest going in small groups as the place is relatively small, with each stop here the novelty of the hidden doors wears off on this trip they had a menu of christmas themed drinks this selection of savory or coconut flavored drinks just did not do it for me i struggled to find anything to my liking i would also say after three drinks my head felt the same as if i had drank 3 glasses of water what happened to the booze the reality is this is a tight bar that if you get in you are packed in like sardines and have a long wait for service if at a table along with a limited menu of drinks sure if you remember your favorite from last time you are in good shape i am however only in shanghai about six times a year and do not remember which ones i liked there are just too many choices for good cocktails for me to be packed in wait for service and enjoy novelty to make this my go to for cocktails, this is one of the best cocktail bars ive been to  period this is without doubt the top spot in shanghai there are 4 floors the 2nd is more of a laid back vibe the 3rd floor only has 25 seats and has a no standing policy and the 4th is invitation only absolutely love this place concept is fun atmosphere is great and the cocktails are something else, was in town for a meeting and made a point to visit this speakeasy the fact that the passage in and stairs up are hidden within the pretense of a shop selling bar tools makes this truly a speakeasy much like the prohibition period found my way in and went up to the second floor bar as i was there rather early i decided to enjoy a cocktail at that bar at the suggestion of the bartender yumi i started off with that english mule a variation of moscow mule the aroma of the bergamot mixed with the floral bouquet of the bombay sapphire infused earl grey for 5 days at room temperature was quite memorable watching the bartender mixing each of the cocktails would make anyone appreciate the art and science of blending in various flavors and aromas

my second drink was the eastern paris with the unique combination of aged puer and brandy mac the knife as recommended by yumi rounded off my evening another interesting combination of flavorssweetness of the agave spiciness of the cayenne pepper and the aroma of fresh thyme needless to say i had such a great time learning about the drinks and enjoying them i never made it up to the 3rd floor bar which i was told had better selection of japanese whiskey so a return visit is a must whenever im back, this is one of the coolest place in shanghai recently as i read many people are talking about it so i decided to check it out the headed bartender is from japan but i didn�t see him that night they have 2nd and 3rd floors and everyone said you shouldn�t miss 3rd floor i have tried both as there�s no seat available on 3rd floor initially

on 2nd floor there�s a long bar and i think people could just stand around when it becomes packed the staff will control the guest number on 3rd floor so you can�t just squeeze in there are only 6 seats at the bar and a few small tables on 3rd floor which offers more complex flavor cocktails the cocktail menu is subheaded by flavors like smoke spice and fruits  vegetables

the cocktails on 2nd floor ranged from rmb85 usd 12 vs 3rd floor starts from rmb120 usd17 up there�s a quiet comprehensive food menu from small bites to pizza served on both floors, found speak low on a list of best cocktails places it did not disappoint over the course of two visits we enjoyed a variety of great cocktails but none compare to the margarita its made with a pepper infused tequila and includes something cilantro from the street its a nondescript small store of books and bar tools the book shelf slides back to reveal stairs above there are two levels of bars this was a great latenight spot for us, speak low takes the bar experience to another level prepare yourself to be amazed by what youll find here, there are several similar establishments but not all of them make the top 100 bars list in asia reservations are recommended there is a standing bar and you would usually hang out there until a table becomes available upstairs they have a vip club for genuine and serious whiskey lovers i think its by invite not sure great selection and very potent, 3 floors of great thematic bar first floor chill bear and simple cocktails second level great cocktail bar wiith nice atmosphere third secret bar great quality cocktails professional bar keepers, speak low is a cool and unexpected experience for those who just arrived in shanghai with not one but two secret bars within itself speak low takes the idea of speakeasy to the next level with real shanghainese charm and vibe

the presentation of the drink is rather special the signature speak low is a chocolatey cocktail served with two pieces of chocolate and a hardpressed ice cube complete with the bars logo which i found was a very nice touch, awesome speakeasy bar with at least they say there is a 3rd hidden one 2 different areas the 1st one managed by shingo gokan is great for groups of 23 persons the 2nd one upstairs if you know how to get in has tables and is better for 45 persons groups, first floor is a bartending tools store you need to find the entrance by yourself then go to second floor for the bar its a long narrow space at second floor only with about 20 seats and 3 tables if you want to have a seat you might be there as early as possible or only can stand in there furthermore third floor is the most recommended place never say that youve been here if you didnt go to third floor this is a smaller place and also with a secret entrance but after you get inside you will find everything worth btw different floor provides different kind of cocktails but the all awesome, this place are full of b and people inside are not welcome friendly  i try 3 time and always same  so will not try anymore , after visiting most of the japanese bars in shanghai or so i thought i did i visited this place after a little search on the web for any more japanese bars out there and i am so glad i did i love the concept of this place and i do not want to go into too much detail as you must experience it for yourself the quality of the drinks are the best in shanghai and this is my new favorite spot for whenever i am in town, went on a thursday night up to the 3rd floor very quiet and intimate but slowly got filled and started to get rowdy exclusively all local chinese and no foreigners took a peek at the 2nd floor and it was the same drinks were expensive but fantastic service at the bar will go again, nicely designed speakeasy with 2 floors for drinking theres a secret 3rd floor bar but it can be quite small and most patrons order a drink and stay for quite a while it can be quite frustrating recommend going in small groups the drinks menu from the 2nd and 3rd floor differ so definitely check out the 2nd while waiting for a table upstairs, the hidden bar in downtown with the best cocktail you may find in pro level bartender are friendly and may mix the surprise you would like for you, first and foremost its common knowledge how hard it is to find a bar with real alcohol in shanghai but this bar has it not only that the bartenders really know their stuff they are polite welcoming and try to accommodate everyone even when the place is packed

amazing drinks a little bit on the pricey side but you pay for quality liquor right go early to get spots on the 3rd floor , i was recommended by friend of mine to try out this speak easy bar the entrance of the bar is actually a bar equipment shop where you can purchase some bar tools or book the secret door in behind the bookshelf the cocktails are one of the best cocktail in town try 3rd floor you will have surprise as well, had a great time at speak low last night faye took great care of us with several different drinks highly recommended great for ex pats, almost impossible to find if you dont know what you are looking for the entrence is cammuflaged and doors with secret access bottons once you get inside you will have a chance to enjoy some very very tasty drinks and nice atmousphere its a little pricy  bring money, at first when we went to find this place it was a little difficult to locate it the front presnts itself as just another shop selling on this occasion bar tools etc but not so upon entering and enquiring you are shown a concealed door hidden in the wall and then a staircase takes you up to a lower bar  here is where the cheaper and more simple cocktails are served but still you can watch some fantastic workmanship behind the bar happening also here is where you may have to wait before a table becomes available upstairs in the smaller and a bit more expensive fancier cocktail bar  once you can go up there is a secret to getting in the door to this upper bar i am not going to reveal it you find out for yourself the concoctions within this bar are outstanding definetly some master barman at work overall be prepared to splurge a bit money wise drink a little to get a decent taste of what cocktail delights there is on offer and enjoy it is well worth it, overwhelming the class this place exudes is overwhelming the concept of secret lair within a secret lair is amazing with a total of 4 stories each one being harder to assess than the previous one with more intricate cocktails more experienced mixologists and more premium ingredients even the quality of glassware improves with each lvl up their signature cocktail blends matcha goodness with chocolate with bittersweet luxury and a nice tannic texture must try if you love understated hole in the wall concepts with world class mixologists, for my background i have a chance to visit many bars in various countires this is the first time i come here and just like i describe on my title everything here is just impressive wonderful and creative drinks with the perfect balance of every cocktail if you love cocktail you cant miss this place when visiting shaghai highly recommend, first of all i adore the secret passages the ambience the buzz the cocktails are incredible nuanced flavours and interesting combintions love the top floor bar and love love love the staff <3 julie astsushi and the owner shingo  its a perfect place to spend an evening enjoying the craftsmanship of the bartenders well worth a visit, very unassuming entry chic and cozy place go there if you do not prefer loud and crowded environment the twisted cocktails are fun and well made i loved the cousin mary the bartenders are professional and well groomed no problem if you are a foreigner one of the coolest hidden bars in shanghai there is level 2 where you need to hit shanghai on a map to have the door opened loved their tissue paper gimmick, it starts with a weird hidden path that probably make some of the hype but the top floor bar is something
quite small and always packed it gives quite a show for every original drinks they have
the food is super refine
really enjoyed it i wish it was less popular though so could enjoy it more often really tough to get a table, this is my favorite bar in shanghai and in the world love the way they make the drinks and all the details they focus on if you are coming to shanghai this is the bar you must go highly recommended, after finding the entrance we found ourselves to be he only westerners in the bar all staff speak english and the bartenders knew their job its a place there are less tourists which is nice, youll get very angry when trying to find the secret passage its very well hidden but thats not why it gets 4 stars the bar itself has three different floors the top floor requires another solving of a map puzzle to enter the room and for good reason the first and second floor have moderately high priced drinks but the the third floor ahs some really pricey drinks they are all very good drinks and they dont shy away from the alcohol but well it was slightly out of my price range when i was paying for both a girl and myself still i understand the prices but i cant give a perfect rating id still recomend anyone i know to go there, it is nice to find a way behind of all the hidden undergrounds but the price for one cocktail in the 3rd floor is too expensive you pay around 120rmb for just one cocktail its nice to be there and the ambient is very cool but for that price i wouldnt stay there a long time, this inconspicuous store sits in the middle of a quiet street a lone storeman stayed silent at the cash register as we walked around the shop filled with curiousity it was up to us to find that secret door that would lead us into a secret underground behind that secret door at 2nd level is a cocktail bar where craftsmen create a plethora of amazing cocktails that even i a semiteetotaller enjoy but the best part is yet to come an even more amazing cocktail menu exists at the 3rd floor theres no rsvp available one has to simply wait it out when its our turn we were presented another puzzle crack it and youll be rewarded with a whole different class of cocktails in a small cosy private room where the craftsmen have no qualms displaying their tricks and showmanship in a little glass

108,"live jazz music as matter of place and bar nothing special
live musica jazz posto e bar non hanno nulla di eccezzionale, dont miss at least a peek into this historic bar and stay for at least a few renditions from the jazz bandthey wont be there forever, the oldest band in the world takes you back in time and you cant help be swept into 1930s shanghai an experience, great atmosphere and a band whos oldest member is 96 charming place to relax at the end of the day, great place for a quiet drink and good jazz the older gentleman that play in the evening are wonderful good bar food too, the jazz bar is on the ground floor of the fairmont peace hotel and features the oldest jazz band in the world  mainly septuagenarians but there is even one 96 year old they are accompanied by a young singer who was very good
the bar is an old style bar with dark wood and tables set around the room with a stage on one side its a little dark in the room but that just helps the atmosphere which is really great  we sat for long time sipping cocktails and listening to the great music the septuagenarians are not the only band they are spelled by youger relatively speaking musicinas too but the music from them all is just great its a very enjoyable way to pass an hour or so in the evening dont miss it, my husband who fell in love with shanghai brought me to this place on my first night in shanghai it was a great fun amid the charming atmosphere but its not just that its the classic vibe you couldnt find anywhere else

imagine the old shanghai you saw in movies great chinese jazz music from very traditional costumed musicians and vocalist the highly western influenced culture in a lounge of an artdeco architecture on the historic street of shanghai thats exactly what youd get from here, we stayed at the fairmont and visited this iconic jazz bar it was happily busy reasonably priced with first class entertainment and a mixed crowd from all over the world, our group enjoyed the jazz bar very much great music nice bar and a very historic setting make reservations we tried to return another night without reservations and it was full, no the jazz isnt great no the drinks arent great yes the food is awful but make sure you experience it its a load of fun watching these personality filled old guys bang away slightly out of time to chinese and other favourites reservations strongly recommended if you dont want a potentially long wait, makes you feel like youve gone back in time i think the jazz band is also the oldest and i mean oldest jazz band in shanghai lots of fun, try this place any evening any day
the jazz band members have been playing here everyday for years  i mean decades 

the place is small and i would recommend sitting at the bar to better view the band

drinks are the same price as everywhere else the venue at the cathaypeacefairmont hotel is great and location right on the bund, we felt like we were back in the louche shanghai of the 1920s it was atmospheric with great music and excellent cocktails we had a wonderful evening, a shanghai institution with great drinks and live music we took only drinks and snacks here but enjoyed the olde worlde atmosphere service was efficient and professional drinks quality very high although a little on the pricey side although you are also paying for a live jazz concert recommended at least once while in shanghai, a great place to go and enjoy an evening great environment and entertainment from this literally old jazz band a septuagenarian sextet highly entertaining in what must be shanghais most famous jazz band an evening of entertainment and nostalgia youll pay a bit more for the drinks but well worth it, the jazz bar fulfils your fantasies of what life was like in prewar and decadent shanghai atmospheric cocktails good whisky and a wonderful old literally jazz band we are not jazz fans but we were entranced by the music and the mellow and tranquil mood of the surroundings our top treat in shanghai, everything was so old school and quaint and cool service staff was great and of international standard especially considering i was in track shoes dont judge me and cargo pants two drinks should about cover you for the minimum spend of rmb200 if youre not too hungry dont need to order food too cos theyll give you assorted tasty nuts but if you are then i recommend the cheese and cold cuts platter only low point in my evening there was really just the local customer who had no qualms or apologies for ramming her chair into mine to get into her seat at the next table  so i guess that doesnt change here no matter how fancy a place you are in, jazz bar is always a mustgo when visiting shanghai and stay at the peacehotel great music great atmosphere, my father celebrated his 70th birthday at the peace hotels jazz bar featuring members of the world famous old jazz band it was a throwback to the past as if we were in the 1920s of old shanghai my father thoroughly enjoyed the experience the high tea canapes and sweets were delectable and worth every cent there was almost too much food get there at 230pm and spend the entire day until 6pm enjoying classic jazz standards soaking in the history and reliving shanghai from yesteryear the staff especially amanda wu and her coworkers edward vicky sarah and alice were fantastic cordial helpful and enthusiastic an extremely memorable experience one that we will cherish forever many thanks to amanda and everyone at the fairmont peace hotel a highlight of our trip and a recommendation to all do not miss this onceinalifetime experience, spent many happy evenings there with cosmopolitan crowd not cheap most evening <u+00a3>150 for drinks for 4 for a few hours
always live music staff excellent, the jazz bar has to be seen to be believed although no jazz fan the atmosphere alone is well worth the visit the price of drinks was a bit naughty and the service not up to normal chinese standards, classic and timeless and very international while listening to standard american jazz songs played by elderly chinese musicians after ordering a negroni you are as likely to be seated nest to a business man from morrocco as a tourist from sweden or a european diplomat or a chinese model

i love it everytime i go there alsays relaxing and fun and engaging the service is excellent, this is what made it fun tbh some of the musicians were seriously old and that made it quaint the bar itself was great but the music was a little challenged, your hear the unique sound at the lobby you see beautiful girls standing in line in front of the bar you have the feeling this is the place you have to see
it is very kind of the girls at the entrance to the bar to inform you that you have to consume at least 200 y per person to go inside it is a nostalgic moment to see the elderly musicians playing a very unique kind of jazz it is fascinating to watch and as more you drink as more you like to listenafter a while and several drinks it is time to leave and go with a smile into the bed or walking , we drank at this place only the place had a retro ambience like we travelled back in time

the members of the band were so old that they felt like they were the original musicians from the earlier days wait maybe they were

the minimum expenditure is rmb300pax good if you have time and cash but not a mustdo, an option to kill some spare time if you have it is a fun way to exeperience the old shanghai with the jazz band and singing of english and mandarine songs there is a minimum spend of cny 150 per person the bar is now nonsmoking which is a welcomed change great atmosphere but not exaclty a have to do item in shanghai, the jazz bar has a great atmosphere one almost feels taken back in time  the band playing was excellent, the band in this bar is a group of 80 year old musicians that have been playing in this bar since the 1970s the music is old style jazz and great music to relax to and sip on a nice glass of wine
word of warning the coverage charge is 150 yuan about $25 canadian per person  entitles you entry and one drink from the bar menu sip an expensive glass of red wine and drink in the atmosphere, a very exclusive place which requires reservation there is a cover charge of rmb 200 which is waived for hotel guests the drinks are priced on the high side but for the kind of place they seem ok the old jazz band is energetic for their age, without a visit to the peace hotel jazz bar any trip to shanghai is incomplete the old men there are still in their best form with the bar completely furnished to resemble what it looked like in the 1920s their music can easily bring you back in time shanghai was the paris of the east and now its getting back there

minimum charge is 100 yuan per person thats the price of one cocktail or two mocktails drinks come with free nuts not bad at all

be sure to go early before the old mens show ends at 10pm, the average age of the jazz players might be 72 but thats the beauty of this place age and experience adds up to talent and great entertainment couples spontaneously got up to dance because the music was so good weekends there is a cover charge but its worth it if you only have a weekend time slot to see and hear this attraction they also served the only dry rose that we could find in shanghai  or china for that matter, slip into the rhythm of the cool jazz and enjoy a drink in fun surroundings the bar is always a happening place but without any pretensions","Chinese cuisine",0.522927368853534
109,"great food and service the place was spotlessly clean and we enjoyed it very much everything on the menu was great and the neighborhood is very nice  right near a pedestrian shopping zone

loved the xiaolongbo pork soup dumplings waitress even taught us how to soak the julienned ginger in soy and vinegar, the restaurant was a bit sterile in atmosphere and staff had to be hailed when trying to order get sauces or pay bill the food was inferior to other restaurants in the chain we were surprised when our hotel recommended this chain for dim sum but thought wed follow their recommendation, this was recommended as a top place for dumplings by my hotel concierge i enjoyed the visit but it did not live up to the hype the menu has a lot of variety i tried 6 different dishes mostly of the dumpling variety they were good but nothing outstanding or better than other places to get dumplings the atmosphere was cafeterialike the service was attentive and prompt, it has it all good location good food and good value for money so if you are around and fancy some good food especially good dim sums chinese dumplings go for it i believe stuff can speak english, it is usual for us to have lunch in this restaurant our preferred to experience dumpling taste is very good the best is the mix shrimps+pork maybe little bit smooth to match with western tastes more than for pure chinese
selections of rices good cantonese and noodles are wide and tasty
for italian habit desserts are not the best, if you are looking for authentic shanghai food with shanghai ambiance give this place a miss its a kin to eating in a cafeteria ok the food was tasty but not delicious and this place is written up as one of the best in shanghai no
brazed beef noodles highly recommended but the dumplings a bit on the dry side and almost drained of necessary juices which makes shanghai dumpling cusine so tasty
customers are specialtell your staff, definitely the best dumplings in shanghai also amazing to watch chefs make the dumplings so quickly and effortlessly, whenever i have guest visiting from abroad i always take them to din tai fung my favorite lunch time restaurant great smilingquick service the food is well prepared and delicious every time all their dumplings are great for an extra treat try the truffle dumplings so tasty and addictive a bit pricey but worth the extra rmbs , the setting was nice and clean and the menu easy to understand the service was ok although english was not widely understood some of the dumplings we ordered were lovely especially the special steamed pork xiaolongbao but others the vegetable ones for examples lacking in depth of flavor all in all we felt the dumplings were no better than you can get elsewhere in fact i preferred those we had for breakfast at the fairmont hotel maybe worth trying for lunch but not worth making a detour for, we went to the din tai fung in iampm the food was very good but the service horrible we have a toddler and i asked three times before they brought out the plastic dish cup and fork for her we also asked for water and there were four of us but they only gave us three waters we ordered three xiao lung bao and they came all at once for some reason this is the way they serve it in many branches around the world  bangkok kl la only in taipei do the xiao lung bao come individually what i mean by this is that one order is served and once that is finished they bring out the next one this keeps the xiao lung bao fresh and hot and the wrapper does not harden anyways we waited and waited for the spicy wontons and noodles we ordered great food but they need to work on service, this place runs like clockwork youll probably have to wait to get a table but its worth it quick efficient service excellent food spotlessly clean every tim we are in shanghai we visit this restaurant and its consistently good, we have visited din tai fung in several other countries including taiwan itself and the food is consistently great the signature xialongbao is great which flavourful soup inside and the skin is soft and thin accompanied with ginger strips and vinegar i could easily have ten of those

great ambience at the xin tian di restaurant and the staff were attentive our orders came quite fast and like din tai fung everywhere there are english menus just take a number and start queuing, safe choice when you are not sure where to eat the standard differs in different countries but it wont give you a nasty surprise what i like is that they give kids a small bottle of the dough they use to make the dumplings my child loves to roll and mould the dough the staff separately made a small pig using a dough and it looked so nice, great great restaurant i love it  there are many around shanghai so you can try all of them since the menu is the same really delicious and highly recommended especially the dumplings , we always return to din tai fung for their beautifully created xlb and other dumplings with crepe like thin wrappers their cold appetizers are also excellent along with the delicious soups on their menus looking forward to their arrival in new york city, perfect for business lunches this signature restaurant is one of several in shanghai great xiao long bao several versions veggies noodles for a perfect meal pricy but its still always busy, we decided to go out and explore shanghai for the first time during our 16 hour connection we came here for lunch based on a personal referral from a friend that lived in the area

the restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of a mall in the beautiful area of xintiandi there was a wait of 20 mins but we didnt mind once seated we ordered a variety of xiaolongbao with a few veggie options for balance the food was fantastic as new yorkers we tend to be a bit picky but were pleasantly surprised we stuck with the xiaolongbao since this is what they are known for and cant wait to go back one day

id recommend to go with some spare time to just wander the streets and enjoy a cocktail in the area afterwards, 130 rmb for 10 excellent dumplings pork and 10 solid veggie dumplings veggie options were limited but aight

best pork dumplings ive ever had

, the food the service and the ambiance are in a word superb and as a frequent visitor over ten years i can safely say i have never been disappointed be it lunch dinner or supper its a great venue for a gathering of family friends casual business or tourists

the standout show piece are the xiao long bao the famous shanghai pork dumplings with the soup inside you can actually watch these little delicacies been made

the starters of marinated cucumber pickled vegetables chicken spring rolls the double boiled chicken soup or the hot and sour soup should not be missed and these are just a few of the enticing little nibbles

stir fried green beans with pork cabbage with bacon pork chop fried rice and the many other varieties of dumplings are all sized to share are my favourites and you can sample a wide variety of selections with out overeating

shanghai is a big place and they have several restaurants spread across the city all are equally as good this restaurant is a must try you wont be disappointed, the din tai fung formula is very very successful for a reason when i look at their signature dish the xiao long bao i see a very well made dumpling almost perfectlooking however it is devoid of soul and that is my main critique that the franchise is devoid of soul and i find it very important for soul food to contain soul

you are treated very proper greeted proper and they give you a questionnaire afterwards due to the large size of the franchise the management does pretty well to guard the quality but if they could improve the price point and add soul they have solved the million dollar question and earned their last star

please ask around and look for a local superstar xiao long bao passionado seek and you shall find, great dim sums come early to escape waiting line mini dim sums with soup are the best cold appetizers waist of money too simple and not best quality stay with dim sums only, really good dim sum in xintiandi which is a mustsee part of shanghai its in a shopping mall so not the most atmospheric but the food is great the shanghai dumplings here are delicious a bit pricey but worth a visit, definitely worthy of the hype both the dumplings and the buns were delicious  definitely follow the instructions on the card to get the ginger soy and vinegar ratio right for your dip  it makes a huge difference the shrimp and asparagus was also good, i was a little surprised by the totally unromantic atmosphere of this placei even had some trouble finding it because i didnt realize it was on the second floor of a mall but the food was great and cheap and we had a very good time, had three types of dumplings  pork shrimp and a mix in a spicy sauce the skins were perfectly smooth and light a great pop when poked with the chop sticks the green beans in prok were good though the beans were a bit overcooked and lacked the snap of fresh cooked staff was friendly and quick the atmosphere of the place was a bit bland the area its in has a lot more cool places to hand out for a beer but the food here is great a bit more pricey than a locals place but worth going to, every shanghai trip ill go to the ding tai fung in xin tian di  i believe its the best in food quality service  taste, the xiaolongbao are delicious and the spicy shrimp and pork wontons are as well but it is overly expensive and there is not enough food to feed a full table so youll order multiple dishes

pros delicious food good atmosphere and nice service i went to the one on the 4th floor of the kerry center

cons not enough food per dish too expensive, xiao long bao soup dumplings try them you will not be disappointed
ive eaten at this place in singapore sydney and beijing always high quality clean and delicious, if youre looking for excellent quality dumplings this is the place to go a group of us went twice during our 2 day stay in shanghai which is an indication of how good we thought the food was one of our group is a vegetarian and she found plenty on the menu to enjoy in fact we all really enjoyed the freshness of the vegetable dishes the staff were really helpful and told us we were ordering too much food and they were right not the cheapest restaurant in town but definitely worth it, you can forget about eating dumplings anywhere in the world after you have been here the most paper thin wrappings encasing delicious fillings xiao long bao are famous here and once you have had one you will know why, for our trip to shanghai i googled different restaurants and when it came to dumplings all sources i found mentioned din tai fung as the best place to get them we knew the restaurant would be in the xin tian di area and we walked around looking for it in the older buildings without any luck the restaurant is not located there it is on the second floor of the newer shoping mall south of the shikumen houses

we ordered three different sets of dumplings and enjoyed every last one of them the restaurant is a part of a chain but dont let that stop you they serve great food and they have english menues so you exactly what you are ordering there is even a small guide how to eat the dumplings the proper way

this restaurant is well worth a visit, this is the best restaurant i have ever been to the food is just spectacular it is spacious and the ambience is very nice you get a nice view of xintiandi to go go go, i went there with some colleagues from italy singapore and indonesia i was the only one who wear hijab at that time at first my colleagues already plan to separate the order into two pork and non pork order but then before we start to order somebody who was looked like a manager of the restaurants he simply asked and reminded us about the order because he saw that i am a muslim he saw it from my hijab i was just simply happy and relieved for the thoughtful concern he had
anytime i miss shanghai i think i will just go to din tai fung jakarta and hopefully can feel again the hospitality athmosphere they gave me, din tai fung is by far the best xiao long bao i have ever tasted

the restaurant which is in the 2nd floor of a mall on xin tian di is spacious welllit clean and comfortable you are greeted by receptionists who will seat you as soon as a table becomes available the staff speak and understand english so it is not too difficult to communicate they are also welltrained courteous and efficient

there is an extensive menu apart from the house specialty xiao long bao prices are reasonable and selections are varied we tried 3 types of xiao long bao which come in orders of 10 pcs each my favorite was the shrimp they even have a printed card with step by step instruction on how to eat the dumplings

if you want to be seated quickly try to come early we arrived around 6pm and got a table right away by 630 the queue for a table was already long

must try when in shanghai

ps they have several branches saw one at a new strip mall across yuyuan garden","hot pot house",0.999427292300058
11,"its one of the highly recommend place to check out for xiao long bao they make fresh xiao long once you orders its take around 10 mins to 20 mins waiting time depend on the que its delicious and juicy xiao long bao highest recommend the crab meat xiao long bao, they mainly serve xiao long bao they had run out of many of the types luckily there was an english menu because the line was out the door and the woman at the door taking orders wouldnt have waited for us to translate everything the place is tiny and you have to share a table

we ended up having the crab with pork and egg with pork because thats all that was left the crab tasted like shrimp we liked the pork and egg one better it was pretty good the sauce they had with it on the table could use more vinegar soy sauce and needed some ginger we are actually partial to din tai fung for xlb, we were lucky to have chinese friend with us he translated us the name of this place because there is no english name in the entrance there is always line of people waiting to enter the reason is that there are not many tables everybody seat close to each other nothing to look around just eat and go away at the evening or may be always there were only a couple of dishes to choose from food is normal price is good, went to this branch the second time first was exactly a year ago to give it a second chance dissappointed again  will not return for the third time ive tried better elsewhere, the xialong baos are about 30rmb for 12 pieces and the space is very small with about ten tables you need to queue to buy what you want at the cashier and find a seat the ladies will bring out the food and call out the number printed on the receipt after which you can show them the receipt to claim the food you must have a receipt before finding a seat, jia jia tang bao is a small shop that many locals refer to as the best soup dumplings in the city

we ordered pork pork and shrimp and pure crab soup dumplings each order comes with 12 soup dumplings with ultra thin skin and nongreasy broth after you place your order at the counter try and grab a seat most likely youll be sharing with strangers when youre dumplings are ready theyll bring them out to your table

while the crab ones are definitely worth trying i personally prefer their original pork ones and shrimp ones ive also heard great things about their mushroom ones but they were sold out when we got there, for those who enjoy a small restaurant with 810 tables all locals and a festive environment this is a must stop roughly a block or two westsouthwest of the marriott city center is a restaurant that only serves dumplings  primarily pork and crab there are often lines of people to wait to eat or order take out

the whole street has different restaurants but this place seemed to have a buzz with the locals in comparison to the other establishments there are no frills inside but this is something worth trying, i eventually found the place after a good deal of searching  the high buildings in shanghai played havoc with my phones gps by 1115 the place was full and queueing outside but i chanced my lock with a table for 4 accompanied by some travellers from korea
as expected unfortunately and hopefully not too cynically there was only a limited range available  pork and prawn pork and egg and the expensive crab option we settled for the first two with a coke and a tsing tsao beer
prices were excellent just over <u+00a3>3 for 12 small ish soup dumplings and around a pound for the beer  in total around <u+00a3>6 for a tasty if busy lunch as such there is nothing really to be anything other than delighted about
but  ill be honest  although very cheap the dumplings are not the best ive had by any means and everything was a little grubby
i will return as the food is really good and the prices brilliant if you want really good authentic local dumplings with lots of locals to boot this is the place for you if you want the best that shanghai has to offer though i suggest you get out some plastic and go further afield, tried two types  the pork dumplings were just 15rmb for 12 and the crab and pork ones were 30rmb for 12 i liked the crab and pork ones more  good xiao long bao very worth it for the price as well no queue at 1030am but when we were leaving the area about 1145am there was a queue outside the shop already so do come early , it is a small local bun restaurant we waited for a while before we could even get into the restaurant it was totally worth waiting for though as a chinese foodie i would say that i want to go back to wait in the long line again just for other flavors some tips 1 go earlier they have a board shows what kind of flavors they still have for the day or that moment when we got there around 1400 in the afternoon there were only crab fillings buns <u+87f9><u+9ec4><u+5305> left we enjoyed it a lot but wish we could try other fillings 2 the juice in the buns is hot i suggest to wait for the buns to cool down just a little bit otherwise you cant really taste the super yummy and fresh taste, we were introduced to jia jia tang bao by locals luckily for us they were there early and secured a table these are most definitely the best of the best and i will definitely make this my must go to place each time i visit shanghai the only downside is that it will be extremely difficult to eat dumplings anywhere else, this review is aimed at all foreigners dont be worried about the total lack of signage in anything bar chinese there is reason that there is a queue outside the door on a cold cold day in february

the dumplings are excellent

as you enter an english menu is whipped out choose your dumplings pork or pork
plus eg shrimp plus soup if you want pay the ridiculous 15rmb for the standard 12 dumplings stand for a table sit and wait  all of 5 minutes for us and then enjoy a little simple chinese heaven

the dumplings are steaming hot and you add some sauce and chill from the table lovely

so no service no frills just great fun push that door open and enjoy, small little gem mostly locals that eat here we came during dinner and was busy table is shared since the place is jam packed very tasty crab and pork dumplings an order consists of 12 dumplings good cheap beer at rnb 8 definitely recommend it but dont be shy when you come here or think you can have your own table, i went at 600 pm no wait for table about a 20 minute wait for the food i had the mixed crab and pork dumplings as the straight pork was apparently sold out ill have to return for the pork dumplings definitely worth a visit but the best dumplings in shanghai debatable i found it amusing that there is a shiny yangs dumplings across the street which definitely rivals or surpasses the offerings of this place that being said definitely worth a visit, a bit hard to find no roman alpabet name on the outside just look for the number 90 but rewards are to be had in the form of the most freakishly good xiao long bao ever no extensive menu just really good and cheap the locals seem to approve, when i think of the best soup dumplings ive ever had this is it better than din tai fung joes shanghai nanxiang in flushing ny way better than xiao yang fried dumplings across the street hands down the best ratio ive had of soup to flavorful meat a perfectly juicy bite of thin but chewy skin essenceofporkgoodness juice and perfectly cooked pork
prices are crazy affordable at rmb15 for a basket of plain pork rmb30 for pork and crab i also had the rmb99 pure crab but i was underwhelmed my favorite is actually the cheapo plain pork as with most places
this place is a real hole in the wall sit on stools hold your bags in your lap drink beer out of flimsy plastic cups and hunch over a tiny table youre sharing with another party the xlb are made to order and there is table service but you pay at the front counter the line gets really long around noon so try to come little earlier i dont think the staff speaks any english but they are used to foreign tourists this place is definitely not a tourist trap the line is full of local regulars speaking shanghainese, the dumplings are just perfect and they are very inexpensive we had a full dinner with dumplings and soup for about 30rmb each the place is small and the staff dont speak any english however there is a foreigners menu in english each choice of dumplings consist of 12 dumplings not a lot of people there when we visited propably because of the chinese new year holiday absolutely a must if you are looking for authentic xiao long bao, been here with my wife after reading all the good reviews we arrived around 6pm and seated after 15 min wait only available crab and pork for 30 yuan x ptnof 12 dumplings or 99yuan xptn for pure crab
fair enough its one hour before closing and although i could see in the kitchen a big pile of pork with little minuscule pieces of crab meat on the tip i believed the owneryou could make pork only
we bought 2 servings they were good but you couldnt taste crab at all in the filling
we had another couple of days in shanghai and decided to get back here the following day at noon to sample the cheaper option of pork only for 15 yuan for a serving of 12 this option being good value for money
we arrived at 1220 pm and surprisingly found out that the only options available were again the same as previous evening how can everything can be sold out already 7hr before closing  this time a big pile of meat with not even crab meat on top was there in the kitchen big disappointment i took some photos they let you in advertising good value for money then charge you the most expensive on the menu its not for the 45$ price mark but for the taking the pi
order just one portion to give it a try but no more than that, i cannot get the delicious thought of these dumplings out of my head

luckily at around 11 on a thursday morning there were no lines, these xiao long bao are as good if not better as din tai feng the pork and soup are more flavoursome and the skins although not as thin they have more of a bite 15rmb for a whole basket 12 dumplings is hard to beat the dumplings are made fresh to order so you need to wait about 15 minutes but is 100 worth it, ok so we thought ya right what are the chances the 12 tripadvisor spot in shanghai is only a 5 minute walk away from the marriott the street this place is on is like a movie set very colorful loud busy but not crowded we walked the street 3 times before deciding that it was the place with all the people in line it was late and we didnt have the energy to we walked up the street north and found a big spot that had pictures on the menu and lots of cold tsingtao
later in the week we were back in shanghai and we headed to jia jia make a note there is no sign anywhere on the building that say jia jia tang in english
take dingxing rd to huanghe rd and turn left its like 2 or three down on the left
dont worry about language they have an old color photocopy of the menu and you want pork and shrimp anyway  the red hanging sticks indicate what they still have available that daynight at least i think that was what it was if there are two of you one should go get a seat as they fill quickly and others did the same the plastic glasses flimsy are funny and the staff is amazing and charming please try this place even if you not an adventurer the dumplings were almost too amazing and one order of each was too much for the two of us oh and it was very inexpensive, we rarely repeat places while traveling but came here 3 days straight while in shanghai because we loved it so much no frills atmosphere but superb quality compared to others we tried and fair prices at 30 yuan for 12 dumplings and 8 yuan for a big beer

things sell out through the day so come early to avoid that and between peak hours to avoid long lines, not many seats not many stores staffs are rude sometimes  better to have some patience

the xia long bao is soooooo juicyyyyyy so good when you eat in the winter warm up your body it is so yummy that i cant find this quality in my hometown sure it is a must try item in shanghai the price is cheap too  12 xia long bao with rmb$30

wanted to try the pork one but sold out quickly only tried the crab one sooooo good

tips
 dont try to pretend smart when you come with your friends i mean there are lots of travelers doing that ask one friend to go into the restaurant and find the seats another one queue for order you will definitely get scold and ask to go out from the restaurant

 better to be a good traveler follow the queue after ordering the dish the staffs will arrange for you

 be patience again the xia long bao are made and steamed right after your order

 try to order your food in one time

 better to put your receipt on the desk so the staff can deliver your food to you actually they will yell the receipt number to find the customers

 the place is small better go with a small group or by yourself, this is a very popular place to eat xia long bao since 630 am to 730 pm highly recommended the crab and pork ones 12 pieces just 31 yuans be patient its a small place there are many customers and you might need to wait for a while theres a menu in english but the employees dont speak english that much, coming from singapore im no stranger to xiaolongbao the main attraction here at jia jia but the xlb here is one of the best ive ever had � the filling is very fresh the skin wrapping the dumplings is thin yet strong and there are so many varieties to choose from the vinegar on the side is not as sharp as i would have liked but with xlb this good and fresh it didnt matter very much best of all the lunch we had here st jia jia was the one of cheapest we had on our entire trip while not losing on quality 5 stars all round tip if you are in a group have the rest of them grab a table while 1 person queues up to order, there was a long line but it moved reasonably quick though it was 9am we liked them but not really all that atmosphere is interesting good people watching, went in search for this little eatery based on tripadvisor reviews and we werent disappointed its a tiny restaurant very very simply decorated and a queue which we joined at 1030 am went on for 40 minutes well worth the wait we had steamed crab and pork dumplings and a seaweed and egg soup both absolutely delicious

the place is a bit of an experience in itself a bit grumpy cashier pulls out a little menu in english as soon as she sees a foreigner you order and pay at the entrance then get escorted to a table which may well be shared with a few more people service is ruthlessly efficient as they want you out in 30 mins max but the meal is so good youll want to come back for more, i know ding tai fung has a higher end dining experience and better service but way over priced and yu garden is now too commercial aiming for tourists and it has lost the original taste of xiao long
if youre after an authentic and original taste experience of shanghainese steamed pork dumplings xiao long bao jia jia tang bao is the right place for you, i tried different soup dumpling in shanghai  this is the best i bought the crab roe pork soup dumpling the skin is so thin and the meat is so juicy you can taste the crab roe too its very good price of 30 yen per basket 12 pieces service is good compare to other small shop along the nanjing pedestrian walk the shop is small and clean worth to walk there to just to try this soup dumpling for snack, this small restaurant located in huanghe lu and close to peoples square metro station exit 9 is very popular for different styles of chinese dumping xiolongbao

please note that there are always a long queue for dining inside and please dont expect you would sit for long time because there are many people waiting and the restaurant is so small for you to stay long nevertheless the food is great and the price is very reasonable, the best soup dumplings ive ever had  the porkcrab was delicious everything is freshly made the restaurant is a bit small so you may need to wait for a seat even in the middle of the afternoon but the food is worth it, i had the pork and egg soup dumplings here and they were probably one of the best things i ate during my entire trip to china easy to find easy to order and you can watch the kitchen masterfully prepare each serving by hand fun experience, excellent xiao long bao crab ones are not to be missed the duck blood soup is nice and warm exactly whats needed in cold morning queue can be a bit long so come early or outside regular meal hours, not much to say except the dumplings are amazing here and definitely the best i have ever tasted had the pork and porkcrab the pure crab were all sold out so make sure you get there early enough a little hard to pick out on the row of restaurants and naturally seating inside is limited great place to visit by yourself or with your group, was there for a conference when we slipped out for tea this restaurant is famous even amongst the locals and the best time we were told was to come during off peak hours like tea time at around 45pm we ordered 2 baskets of xiaolongbaos xlb the regular ones and the the crab meat xlbs the dumplings are freshly made when the order comes in and steamed to perfection pay 2rmb extra for the vingear and ginger strips to go with the dumpling the flavours are 100 enhanced with the condiments lastly wash it down with a bottle of the local tsingtao beer and viola you have just experienced the best steamed xlb dumplings arguably in the world, i think jia jia is still the most popular soup dumplings shop in shanghai everytime i visit i see it is packed with local shanghainese chinese from other provinces and foreign visitors around the world in compare with their old branch in he nan south road the hygiene level is much improved in the current branch on huanghe road i got 3 tips want to share

1 please go before 1030am to avoid the long queue so you can also leave some room for lunch in other places later

2 you can take 23 order ie 8 pieces instead of 12 pieces the standard price per order is 12 pieces but if you ask you can just take 8 pieces at prorata cost as sometimes you only go by yourself or with a small group you can just order 8 pieces x different types to try more flavors

3 you can order frozen soup dumplings and take back home please call them at 21 6327 6878 to reserve your order one day in advance you can buy a handy bag from them at around rmb10 and each bag can carry 1012 orders of frozen soup dumplings i used to buy this on my way to the airport on the day i leave but make sure you check in the baggage and put them into your suitcase of course will suggest you to do this if your flight time is around 3 hours though the taste won�t be as good as you have them fresh in the restaurant but sometimes you want to share good memories with your family or friends at home, previously in 2013

they only sell dumplings and several varieties of them if you are looking for more you might want to visit dingtaifeng instead

the dumplings were fresh and tasty we have 3 varieties at a fraction of the price at dingtaifeng

it is a small restaurant serving the locals so dont expect some swanky ambience you might have to share table when the restaurant is packed

of late

still the same tasty food
still the same location
it was renovated since the last time i was there the ambience is better now
prices increased slightly but still reasonable, be ready to dive into chinese culture dim sam are tasty but as for us its a little bit dirty as their a lot of guests  you will wait more than 10 minutes, we ordered two types of xiao long bao one with pork the other is all crab meat they are very tasty and flavorful it is steaming hot and very juicy they come in steamed with small dishes for the vinegar so your dumpling wont be cooled down, it is one of the best street food places in shanghai they also have a small sitting place try it it is a good value for money however the fried dumpings across the street are better, i confess my traveling friend and i had our hearts set on yangs fried dumplings across the street but they were closed so we opted for jia jiatang bao wow we would never have discovered this place had yangs been opened we have eaten at yangs several times on other visits to shanghai the xiao long bao steamed dumplings here are absolutely delicious dont be scared away by the line to get in its worth the wait we had breakfast there we will certainly return on our next visit to shanghai, i arrived 10 mins before the opening time and there was already a line outside within 15mins of allowing people to order and sit down the place was full however the restaurant is really small so chances are you will have to wait about 2030mins in the line the is really good and the service is quick i personally think these are better then din tai fung but everyones taste is different i ordered the normal pork and the pure crab one the normal one was really good but the pure crab one was not to my liking no soup inside overall will go back if i am in shanghai again, i arrived early in the evening hoping that i would be able to get a seat right away the line wasnt very long but the allpork dumplings were sold out instead i got to try the crab and porkcrab dumplings  which were plentiful and delicious if you want to try the soup dumplings with black vinegar you will need to pay a little extra

the restaurant is quite small and can get crowded easily i would suggest visiting at an awkward time to avoid a crowd andor feeling pressured to finish your dumplings quickly slow eaters take note, delicious dumplings i tried the pork and crab dumplings which were excelent you have to pay rmb2 for a vinager sauce and rmb30 for 12 dumpling pieces
they have an english menu the place is a very basic room with some tablesgreat food thoughhighly recommended, the dumplings here melt in your mouth the place doesnt look like much but the food sure is good you get to added bonus of watching them prepare the dumplings behind the counter which is entertainment in and of itself go here get and order of their steamed dumplings and then walk across the street to yangs and get an order of fried dumplings and youll be set, we know this shanghai famous dish since we visit area 10 years ago but we had never noticed this small unique restaurant with delicious steam bread all kind the filling just melt in your mouse and the bread is so tender a must have when you visit shanghai just must, seriously we ate all three meals here one day amazing soup dumplings and the kind of local dive that makes you feel legit, i visit jia jia tang bao with 2 friends pass lunch hour so as many had previously mentioned the pork only filled steamed dumpling had run out we ordered two servings of the pork  crab meat filling

they were absolutely delicious the filling was very flavorful and accompanied with the succulent broth in the dumpling the bao was heavenly

however the small stall gave a cold feeling and was barely furnished moreover the place was not tidy and unfortunately gave a sense that the staff were unhygienic

that aside i still highly recommend trying these xiao long baos they were better than the xiao long baos i had at taiwanese chain din tai fung singapore branch, the dumplings at jia jia are the best i had so far in china and elsewhere unfortunately others think so too as a result you might have to wait in a long queue i had the crab and meat dumplings for 30 rmb as well as the crab dumplings for 99 rmb both are very good crab alone is a special treat and definitely worth the extra yuan, visited with my wife on a sunday around 12pm on arrival the small casual eatery was very busy but we ordered two steamers of crab and prawn soup dumplings these were the only two options left on the menu with ginger dipping sauce and a coca cola each we waited for a seat and then went to sit down little english is spoken the food was fantastic very hot and tasty however the place is a bit too casual rushed hot with people tightly packed in on very small tables and chairs the place is a bargain though only 70rmb the dumplings were very good i would return","Jazz bar",0.999559066224964
110,"we went to masala art on a business lunch on 18th march

the food in this restaurant is exceptionally good the ambiance is also amazing with dimmed lights and providing a cozy feel but the service from the staff specifically 1 waiter spoiled our mood and we felt very low while we left from this restaurant the waiter was very pushy and would not let us order according to our preference we could see that he would also not treat his other customers properly the management should do something regarding this i would recommend to try their food by not to dine at their dagu road branch

they also serve halal food, i went to this restaurent in march 2016 with my family  ad had lunch over there food was good services was good  spices and salt in the food was perfect
overall good food and experience, we were in search of good vegetarian food and we came across this indian restaurantits big nicely decorated and was filled with customersthe nearest metro station is west nanjing line 2 from there it is on a 13 km or 15 min walking distance
however its a busy restaurant as staff is less for serving food
food was great we ordered dal fry and paneer kadhaiboth were good with sufficient quantity for 2 people
overall if you are tired of chinese foodits a must try, delicious indian cuisine very tasty food traditional indian interior with the staff wearing indian outfits overall good experience certainly recommened, we arrived late without a reservation but were stl welcomed with fantastic appetisers and service
curries were fantastic and the wine was perfect and inexpensive
there is a lot to choose from on this street but we think we made the right call, the chicken masala is the most important india cuisine it is high level in masala artand the naan is also yummy the paste with side dish is very india the waiters and chefs are also from india even the most of guests, centrally located and good ambience good quick service very average food qualify cottage cheese and chicken were not fresh and preparations were not authentic no remorse from the staff not recommended, hi if you visit shanghai and if you want to indian taste than these is the best hotel each and every taste is of indian taste i use to visit daily these hotel specially for indian tea due to area location its somewhat costly but fulfill your needs, if you are hungry and wana taste indian chats and snacks this is the place in shanghai to hog and munch , on our trip to shanghai we had googled for indian restaurants and came across this one coz it was closer to our hotel radission blue went there for dinner on the first day and kept getting hitched to go back everyday and trying different meals it was just too perfect for us we went there for dinner all 6 days of our stay the staff was really helpful and friendly amazing indian restaurant in shanghai a must visit for every indian food lover, we came here on a recommendation and it didnt disappoint it isnt cheap but it filled me up and was worth it naan was hot and crisp and vegetarian options plenty sadly no paneer that night but i wasnt stuck for alternative choice i would recommend channa masala

it was a busy night but we were served prompt and the staff were very nice only downside was no toilet roll left in the ladies but luckily i noticed beforehand overall i would definitely recommend, nice restaurant  we could get all indian food here we struggled a lot to get indian good in shanghai, i am a vegetarian and prefer the simple homemade less spicy variety tried the vegetarian thali as for a single person the rest of the combinations wouldve been a waste  for the price of rmb 138  it was quite good  more than filling 1 nan roti  split into 4 pieces some rice starters lots of vegetables  dal salad some desert etc  though i dont like to stuff myself so left much of it unfinished and felt sorry for doing so a complimentary bottle of water was also served  though it wasnt clear it was complimentary i was surprised as i expected them to charge for it
though quite rich and spicy the food was tasty and i had no complaints very good presentation, excellent indian food few minutes from xintinadi and naniking road

they have opened a new reaturant right next to this one which is also good

in china u can also order through sherpa  understand english just call the resturant and place it order the call sherpa to pick and deliver it to ur hotel  just give hotel phone no

we were 6 people and one meal used to cost us around rmb 650 which is standard in china

they also make fill a which is otherwise not in the menu, my fav eating place in shanghai
its the best indian food you can get in shanghai
great garlic naan with dal

also the try the chola bhatura, we visited with 4 this restaurant and were surprised with the quality and taste of the place the restaurant has a lot of nice places to sit but got very crowded with indian people later that evening so crowded that it was difficult to get your bill at the end but the staff did what it could to serve every body nice food good admosphere and beautiful place to sit the chicken tandoori was excellent the lamb kebab very good the lentil curry and the cauliflower with potatoes were very nice even as all there different bread a surprising place to eat in this interesting street, the restaurant location is right on the food street
most happening place
nice decor
good staff
you feel like india right in the heart of shanghai
its not only popular with indian
but sub continental and arabs and white man too
good taste
nice servings
a place where you find your desi food with a touch
over all a good experience, we went to this place after another indian restaurant hit wicket was closed on sunday evening this place was about 15 minutes by cab from pudong avenue area initial impressions of the place was awesome and rich interiors service was excellent while i was tempted to go for the veg thali settled for ala carte and ordered paneer rotis and dal the food was just awesome very rich in flavour and the quantity was quite a lot prices i would not say they were really expensive and justified the restaurant interiors etc highly recommend, i visit every week with my wife the food and service is always fantastic
a very special thanks to deepak the most friendly and happy waiter in shanghai
thank you for all the special moments, if you are looking for best indian street food along with mughlai north indian food than masala art is the best restaurant  all staff is indian to give you feel in india  average cost per person is around 125 rmb if you are in a group  we had gol gappas and fantastic papdi  taste and presentation excellent  ambience is excellent , food is too much expensive taste is also not good as indian dishes quantity is low and waiter should behave properly either customer is indian or foreigner price is ok but taste is not affordable at that price, ordered veg thali delicious food came in time the quantity was enough for two people conveniently located restaurant must visit for all indians, visited this restaurant with an guest from norway for dinner though he was full due to late lunch the food butter chicken and the lamb starter was so tasty that he ended up eating all of it i being a vegetarian liked the dishes very much would certainly recommend this restaurant, the menu is typical indian with many choices and can be somewhat overwhelming you cant go wrong with butter chicken or the lamb vindaloobut if you are undecided or want to try something new ask the waitstaff for recommendations deepak in particular has given me numerous new dishes to try some that arent even on the menu i ate there a lot while in shanghai but could always count on new flavors and dishes that didnt disappoint, masala art is a big relief when it comes to indian food a vegetarian can be sure that she or he will be taken care of in truly the indian hospitality style as you enter it says atithi devo bhava and thats perfect dont miss the delicious kebabs sizzling chutneys and end your meal with authentic indian masala chai thanks mr rajesh prabhakar you are doing a great job, went with a lot of expectations as the decor is very nice but he overall taste of food and the general lackadaisical service made the entire experience a bit dull, first time can be a beginner luck second time assures you that you had the right choice then you cant resist your crave to that tasty food service is great waiters are so welcoming and friendly the let you feel that youre the only one in the world deserves to be served start your meal with tomato soup dont miss samosas its a lovely mix of rather crunchy crust with a tender chilly filling i recommend the butter chicken dal and nan if you dont get a lamb beriani then youre not in india  believe me one time is not enough, used to be a regular customer herebut super disappointed about the services this time
we keep calling the waiters four times no one answered and i dont see any of them are serving other customers finally one guywith a cubby body shape came but with a super rude attitude of the way he talk and keep asking to take out our plates three times though we already keep told him weve not finished  obvious there are plenty of food left we just take a break for chatting the worst part is  he bring out the bills without any of us have asked all of my friends are super disappointed about the dining experience and with that rude service atitudes i dont think i will ever come back again, ive been there 3 times in my trip to shanghai the food is authentic good service
try the chicken masala eith nan  its really tasty and also the eggplant dish, we went this place on the last day of our stay in shanghai and regretted that we dint come earlier 
they have another outlet masala desi next door which caters to the indian street food we tried that and what can i say it was way beyond our expections we tried the tomato shorba chole batura pani puri papdi chatand all that was simply yumm specially the pani puri this is a must must must visit place if u love street food and are bored of the routine north indian food u get everywhere
the service was exemplary the waiters courteous and helpful and the ambience was so soothing
i wish i could give it more than 5 star rating, i went their with friends keeping an open mind as to being able to find an acceptable indian restaurant in shanghai after being so disappointed in the past wellthis to turned out to be the same the staff were a bit slow and not truly very attentive we ordered 2 starters and some drinks at the beginningmust admit starters were not too bad and arrived very quickly there were only 2 other tables with patronsso i expected that the service would have been spot onthey always seemed to busy doing somethingbut not paying attention to customers we ordered a third dishthe lamb chops that have been recommended on this sitenot good at all they seemed to lack any flavour and the meat itself was definitely not fresh after a few more drinkswhich were never served in fresh glasses we decided to have 2 mains and just one garlic nan the amritsar butter chicken was appalling and as for chana masala this had no taste at all i actually told a waiter that the garlic nan was undercooked still raw insidehe actually seemed to not care whatsoever just walked away i do not recommend this restaurantunless there is no other place open in shanghai for food just take a look at the upholstery on the bench chairsit was disgusting i certainly have no intention of going there again, overall the food is good staffs seem to be low in energy price is a little steep environment is great ac is not strong enough, after 4 nights in shanghai we were craving for indian food especially my friend who is a jain while we were in the bund and nanjing street area on the last night of our stay in shanghai we wanted to try indian food and we were referred to this restaurant by a reputed hotel in nanjing street the cab took 10 minutes from there to bring us to this restaurant it is on a street complete with various restaurants on both sides we ordered a veg thaali and a non veg thaali and i must say that though the price was expensive but the food was decent there was enough variety in the food as you would see in the enclosed picture in nv thaali there was a piece of mutton seekh chicken tikka rice dal two vegetable dishes both chicken and mutton curry some salad and a dessert for vegetarians there were two veg starters and paneercottage cheese and mix veg besides the dal and two other vegetarian dishes one thaali is enough for two light eaters but it was not the case with us the only thing that was not upto the mark was parantha which i think was more like a ready made kulcha made warm enough raita curd was also missing the restaurant also serve liquor we saw many europeans and even some chinese dining there

good ambience good food and a must try when you are in shanghai, the restaurant serves pure veg food with authentic indian taste
in case you are craving for indian food in shanghai this is the place to satisfy your taste buds, i come here with my husband for decent indian food food is not great but acceptable i believe the chef accommodates to the locals taste as food is little sweet they only have one unhappy service staff that work all day service is painfully slow no refills of chips unless requested restaurant is mostly quiet on weekends tough they serve rmb100 for a decent buffet lunch which i think is a good value for money ala carte is definitely too pricy, just the regular indian food  slow service  yet food taste is nothing above average  taxi finding is a big issue from this place if the timing is not right it seems very hard to find  we saw not much indians while we were dining  however chinese guests were present  food taste is average not bad  not to good either, to preface my review our group of 6 diners were all indian so we are very familiar with indian food

the service was reasonably fast but very curt and unfriendly we ordered a variety of vegetarian and nonvegetarian items they were all basically average

other reviewers have commented that there are issues with getting a taxi from this place we had the same experience the very rude server topped the bad experience off by telling us i dont have any taxi company numbers

my recommendation would be to pass on visiting this place, great place for the vegetarians the indian snacks are good nice ambience definitely worth a visit, been there many times for the dinner recommend authentic indian food and this place always busy with indian crowed, found this restaurant through trip advisor and i must admit was not at all disappointed visited with my colleague and ordered for starter tomato shorba it was a delicious journey after enjoying tomato shorba to enjoy bhindi masala with dal makhani and garlic naan

dal makhani was nothing i have had before with tomato tadka to dal makhani taste was mouth watering bhindi masala was superb as it was not over cooked which is what i loved ambience is great

recommended for sure, if you are craving for an desi food on a foreign land am sure you wont be disappointed serves fresh and taste food, the food was correct nothing out standing we go there with my family no special attention service was polite but nothing more, large tasteful modern vibe to this restaurant pleasant service and prompt delivery of your food leads to a stress free dining experience well thought out menu plenty of vegetarian options lots of house specialities  but mainly barbecue items and a great wine list their version of lamb rogan josh was great plenty of meat and a good thick sauce the naan bread was excellent i left full and well satisfied, this place has great food great value and also great lunch sets you can order from sherpas for delivery and some days they have special deals which makes it even more worthwhile very pleased with this place
i actually ate with an indian friend who was equally pleased with the taste and value also, cannot stop coming back as authentic as it gets
attentive service reasonable variety there is indian fast food available next door, tasty food and made meals which werent on menu chicken jalfrezi wait staff attentive
really enjoyed the evening until we wanted a cab to the hotel and they refused to order one   stood for 20 minutes in minus 7 degrees before got one spoiled an otherwise great evening, well ive been here quite a few times over the last 13mths and its a good un i like the fact that your made welcome to make requests for anything not on the menu and they are willing to adapt anything you ask for which for me is spice to say the very least i like it hot hot hot cheers guys see you again very soon x, its inarguably the best indian restaurant in shanghai great food attentive staff and value for money must try their samosas and lamb chops, we were in a group of 6 who came in for 31st dec lunch we started of with beers and starters which were decent though the harilali chicken kebab were quite good while ordering the mutton dish i specifically asked the server if the mutton would be soft enough onto which i was assured it will be but that was the case the mutton was very chewy and hard and should be avoided here the rest of the food like dal makhni chicken tikka masala palak paneer breads etc were all made decent

for me the service along with good food matters and the service was just ok till it turned 3pm upon which we were asked to leave because the restaurant shuts down we had just ordered a round of beers and asked for 10 mins to finish the last round of beers we had already cleared our bill in the meanwhile onto which the server with the big stomach along with the thin server with very less hair on his head completely ignored our request and shut the air conditioningi mean really if you were going to do that to kick us out then dont serve us the last round of beers

nowadays good food is very common in many restaurants i visit and to me what matters is also the service so you can be sure i wont be visiting your establishment again, situated on dagu lu`s restaurant row a very comfortable indian restaurant with nice decor service is good if not a little hurried food on the other hand is good not bad but nothing special we tried a tasty eggplant dish that was mainly potato and a tandoori prawn dish with tasteless prawns and bulked out with baby prawns hint if you cant get good prawns don`t serve them otherwise you come across as just being cheap go if you want a comfortable environment with friends with just ok food","dumpling restaurant",0.464747241597488
111,"i came here with some local colleagues who did all the ordering the dishes they ordered including the duck were generally of high quality and quite tasty the service was courteous though a bit slow, this is one of chef dadongs restaurants most famous for peking duck but offering many spectacular dishes presentation is practically museum quality  very sophisticated and incredibly delicious he offers some dishes that are hard to find be advised high quality equals high cost  but you wont be disappointed, the pekin duck is superb the food in general fantastic its a must go pekin duck perfect place, lovely restaurant with great food staff do not speak english but tried to be helpful all the same, first of all im going to start the review by saying that ive been to da dong duck in beijing several times and it is one of my favourite restaurants on the planet i would crawl over hot coals to go to that restaurant so i may be biased in my review

we arrived at 630 for dinner and were told that there was a 90 minute wait for a table on a tuesday night as we hadnt booked we went away and came back 90 minutes later only to be told that there were 14 tables still waiting to be seated before us that was fine there was free wine tea fruit drinks and sweet snacks which were delicious and gave us high expectations of the upcoming meal as we sat reading da dongs beautifully designed phone book sized menu complete with amazing photography

we were eventually seated our total wait time was 210 but had we booked this wouldnt have been a problem the waitress came over to take our order
we ordered
1 duck split between 3 people
1 beijing style noodles
1 sour and spicy cucumber
1 plate of braised eggplant
4 beers

the waitress took our order mostly from memory before calling over another waitress to write down our order

the duck arrived and was delicious with all the usual bits and pieces the three of us finished the duck before the other parts of the meal arrived our 4th group member is vegetarian and so does not eat duck
the cucumber and the eggplant arrived next the cucumber was tasty the eggplant wasnt bad although wasnt as good as beijing it was while we were eating the cucumber and the eggplant we spotted another chef show up near the table and start carving a duck we thought nothing of it then suddenly we recieved 2 new pots of pancakes and a new plate of duck this seemed odd as we had only ordered 1 duck and we had finished eating that minutes earlier we called a member of staff over and explained that we had not ordered the extra duck that was on the table in front of us we did not want it and did not want to pay for another duck she went away for a couple of minutes and came back saying that it was alright when asked if we could eat the duck that was now on the table in front of us i was told alright again as the ducks are carved fresh i assume that any meat served and not eaten is likely to be disposed of no more duck was carved and we tucked into the half portion of duck wed already received half way through the extra duck the staff member came back after conferring with the chef and some other staff members to tell us that in fact we would have to pay for a duck and a half as wed eaten the duck that was left on the table which we thought wed been given the go ahead to eat we asked to speak to the manager and they agreed not to charge us for the second portion of duck again then they took the half eaten plate of duck off our table and placed it on a nearby table so we could not eat any more just out of our reach not really sure what the point of this was as it would presumably just go in the trash it was while we were discussing the duck with the manager that 4 plated of beijing noodles arrived on our table not the 1 plate wed ordered so we had to get the extra 3 plates removed again
when the bill came everything was in order
overall the meal was good although not as good as the beijing branch the issues we had with our dinner could easily be solved by having the waiting staff write down your order as you made it andor reading the order back to the table to confirm, i was taken here for a business lunch by a chinese colleague da dong is a well known and well thought of most any chinese guest will view an invitation here as a sign of respect  and the food is quite good, i went there for a business dinner their speciality is the duck overall on the average the service too i do not know the price as i was invited to go i would recommend to reserve a table in advance, this place sells good and tasty food some expensive and affordable the ambience is very nice and the staff extremely professional, went to da dong in shanghai for the first time i had been to several of them in beijing and have always found them excellent we had my favorite the black pepper beef kung pao shrimp and of course duck

service was very attentive though it did help that we had a mandarin speaking colleague with us, i have visited da dong here and in beijing premises it is wonderful duck is superb but make room for other dishesthis is a modern chinese that becomes a real experience
do not miss, and guess where i had better ones in london in a small place in battersea owned my a top chinese chef immigrated over 10 years ago

even though you make a reservation it doesnt mean your table will be available we had to wait at the bar for at least 30mins which depending of your hunger can be rather annoying

the staff was not pleasant and we had to argue to get more pancakes to eat the duck and even some water
considering the price and standing of the place i dont think that this level of servicing is acceptable

i am sure there are other better places in shanghai to eat the duck  after all it is a huge city with an endless option of places to eat, of all the dozen restaurants tried in 8 days da dong stands out
sheer professionalism with spectacular interior
the duck fantastic enjoyed by the 6 of us
so good we ordered another duck
half our table 3 who travelled extensively in china said this was the best restaurant in china
magical esp the smoking chocolate white chocolate desert
just so classy and enchanting, i love peking duck and my hosts when i travel to china are well aware of this and so on this trip on our first night in shanghai it was off to da dong a well known duck experience in china and it was not disappointing  we were in a private room which is great and the service was incredible the duck presentation was well done and the duck itself some of the best i have had ever had in china and all the other dishes that we had were some of the most creative that i have had in china i will go back there in a heart beat, having tried the original in beijing  i had to have more when in shanghai here thye are less inclined for tourists in beijing they explained the condiment hoices to me and the ducks being roasted are not on show but the food was excellent and i just cant wait for da dong to spread out internationally and come to singapore, duck duck and thats where we should have stopped hailing from beijing as one of the preeminent duck institutions the novel and creative da dong perched atop of one of jingan largest shopping malls should be included on the food savvy travellers list however i would add a qualifier to that as expected the star of our meal was the lean and golden duck accompanied by a plethora of garnishes to enhance its delicious delicate flavours but much like the ostentatious and hifalutin ground floor of the seemingly glamorous mall beneath the further you journey into it it becomes apparent there is a superficial veneer

now let me explain this bold statement francis underwood has always taught me that first impressions last and upon exiting the elevator when you finally find it da dong appears to be an upscale and exclusive shanghai haunt that would not be out of place in a larger european metropolis we are somewhat warmly greeted by three lovely hostesses who indicated it would be a 40 min wait for a table

after selecting a drink from their kitsch and clipped cocktail menu decisions were made and i picked up the food menu with both hands and immediately dropped it da dongs menu is approximately as long as a george r r martin opus to the uninitiated and virgin visitor this may seem confronting and overwhelming i did hear one member of our group mention that she was glad not to be responsible for ordering as the mere thought of having to distil that down was bringing her out in hives

after some lengthy discussions and people losing track we settled in on the following super lean duck sticky pork ribs squirrel sweet and sour fish mashed eggplant and soybean cups old beijing style meatballs broad beans and dried shrimp steamed and pan fried dumplings special fried rice as we started to peel away the veneer of this experience and look past the dramatic theatricality of the plating and presentation the reason for this restaurants reputation became clear dont be too drawn in by your first impression the duck is the real hero and should be appreciated as such

we were a couple of dishes too many for 5 of us and the ones we could have done without were those which felt as thought they were catering for a western palette were looking at you beijing meatballs and eggplant hors doevres the cuisine itself was the highlight as were were largely forgotten about sitting in the centre of the restaurant with our impressive window view

for those foodies out there its not a massive hit to the hip pocket particularly not if youre travelling with euros or usd as a rough guide its approximately only the buckle of a marni belt from the mall below or 65 aud a head for those not versed in the parlance european high street fashion

the meal provides the perfect analogy to summarise our experience as a complimentary closing palette cleaner with almost ceremonial reverence we were offered a plate of strawberries au naturale haphazardly arranged within a shaved ice mountain never content with simplicity the sculpture rested atop a lake of dry ice cascading onto our table much like the duck the strawberries were sweet and delicious but were ultimately overshadowed by unnecessarily theatre and distractions of the accoutrement even as a matter of curiosity we would recommend da dong but be warned  this meal is more guess than gucci, a large group of us dined here recently in typical fashion our hosts ordered lots of items so we had many things to sample the duck was amazing the restaurant is large comfortable very busy service is excellent the menu is a massive book i am amazed they can have such an inventory of food items but they seem to do an amazing job im not sure an uninformed westerner could manage this menu i know i couldnt but to go here with local hosts is a nice experience, i m so so disappointed with this famous restaurant poor service and arrangement

i had already waited for 90 minutes from 1930 at the crowed and noisy lobby then the waitress just informed that the roasted duck have to prepare for 100 mins 2100 already  ridiculousand told us the store will be closed at 2300 whats a five stars restaurant the waitress didnt know when the table is ready and ask us to order the food so do we need to have dinner on high table or lobby area only serving 30 minutes dinner it is a fast food restaurant its totally make us disappointed and upset

we dont mind to wait but they have to tell us the real situation and preparation time when we walk in and get the ticket it waste time and get nothing, ive been back to this restaurant for 3 times over the past year and half as the food is lovely the peking duck was of course a given must try with its crispy skin and moist roasted meat the other must try is the foie gras cherryhawtorn berry depending on season and for dessert the freeze dried chocolate that just melts in your mouth the minute it hits your palette with smoke spewing its both delicious and fun to eat

food aside the thing i didnt like was the wait for a table unless one make reservations way ahead if not it could be an hours wait for a table however they try to make the wait a little more bearable by serving free beverages non alcohol and some snacks but there is not enough seating area in the queue and sometimes we have to stand for some time before a vacant seat is available, make sure your hotel gets u a reservation or expect to wait 2 hrs theres free wine so its okey the restaurant is very hard to find once u see starbucks at ground floor ur near

dont order other stuff in the menu as it will be very expensive duck is good price 3 people can enjoy a whole duck if ur party is more than 3 just order 2 ducks its at 220ish yuan for a whole duck, i walked in to dadong on a wednesday night around 8pm indicated that i am one person and received a ticket i waited an hour and with no idea how long i would wait and then was led to a 2top table in a simple hallway that connects the dining rooms once the waiter arrived and i discovered that we couldnt communicate i waited another 10 minutes for an english speaker to assist my waiter

the peking duck was prepared deliciously another waitress explained how to wrap the duck in a pancake and use the accompaniments

tip its difficult to find the restaurant its located on the 5th floor but you enter on the side entrance go down an escalator to the basement and then take an elevator to the 5th floor where the elevator opens to the restaurant

overall my recommendation is to visit the restaurant with a chinese local to have a better experience solo westerners not so much, we arrive are put on the waiting list and told there will be a one hour wait for a table after 1h 40mins still no table we decide to leave on our way out the headwaiter comes up to us no apologies and asks if we want a singletable room which will be available in five mins the charge for a room is an extra 10 on the check what a complete joke needless to say we left, ive visited da dong several times already and it will always remain good their duck is just amazing their other dishes are great too and served very pretty the view of the jin an district is also amazing, we went to da dong with a group of 6 and had a tremendous meal the duck was excellent but also the other dishes were delicious in their own right and complemented the duck the cherries filled with foie gras were incredible the staff was attentive and helpful and demonstrated how to eat some of the meal i had never tried to fold peking duck into its pancake wrapper with chopsticks before we had a great time and a great meal, this place is something special although we had a reservation we had to wait a bit during waiting time small dishes were served for free we had a table with a view outside  the crowded shopping streets of shanghai already the menu and the wine list are impressive of course prices are high but worth a try
we tried shrimps scalops foie gras goose liver and the famos roasted duck  beijing style
it was so much to eat that i couldt make the dessert excellent restaurant, we where staying at the puli hotel fantastic and since we know dadong quality in beijing and this restaurant is of the same chain and near by we booked through the hotel concierge
reservation for 1930 for 4 and we are asked to be punctual
we arrived at least 5 minutes early and there was along waiting line we bypassed it since we had a booking but very rudely they told us that we had to wait minimum 30 minutes we had 2 young and hungry boys thats why we booked early and said it was not possible they even denied we had a booking luckily the concierge manager from the puli even came across the road to help us nothing we where not offered a drink our interlocutor mrs sue customer senior manager was helpless and certainly doesnt deserve the title
no comment on the food its dadong style good but this doesnt allow them to treat clients this way specially clients with a reservation, chinese cuisine has never been able to compete with the upscale french restaurants generally because of lack of presentation and finesse da dong surprised me with creating excellent flavors with nice plating and presentation still not quite comparable to the michelin starred restaurants but getting close their duck is a must have where the skin is crisp and melts in your mouth which is quite a feat we had other regular dishes like eggplant shrimp which were all very tasty dessert was complementary and included a type of plum that i have never tried before and almond tofu with sizzling sugar crystals again very unique i would definitely be back although make sure you make a reservation as they fill up quickly, their peking duck is amazing and a musteat in china dumplings are also delicious very exquisite chinese cuisine totally recommend ambient and atmosphere are also nice downsides  most of the waiters dont speak englishs prices are high specially wines, from the moment i entered i could feel the energy in the restaurant it is very well done up and the ambience makes it lively and energised

it has the largest menu i have ever seen at any restaurant you will definitely be spoilt for choice whatever we ordered was beautifully presented and loved upto our expectations

the peking duck was absolutely superb a must try place whenever in shanghai, the house specialty is the peking duck i took my friend who was visiting from san francisco and we had a wonderful meal the duck was perfect crisp skin the right amount of skinfat ratio combined by excellent flavor the best ive ever had and ive had many over the years you can order half of a duck which was perfect for two people, visited with colleagues while in shanghai

ordered a variety of dishes including jelly fish beef noodles lychees and of course peking duck

food came out very well presented lychees on a purple lit plate packed with ice for example and the duck was crispy skinned and when sauced up in a pancake truly delicious

most of the dishes were a win in the flavour stakes chicken with a bit of spice put off a couple of my fellow diners with its kick

however the service was not very good at all  it was busy but staff were short and sharp and not very attentive the prices were pretty steep too  the amex took a fair hit for the four of us which pulls this from a potential 4 on food and presentation to a 3, you go there for the duck just excellent we tried the lake shrimp with spring tea interesting taste most dishes are affordable some are very expensive modern atmosphere most of staff do not speak english but manageable try to get a table by the window you get a nice view on nanjing road and new shopping mall area
we reserved but you have to wait anyway, we had a gastronomical feast for a large group twenty some dishes each tastier than the next with beautiful presentations the atmosphere was loud and boisterous but the staff were friendly and the food came out amazing quickly for a packed saturday night numerous dishes of beef chicken fish vegetables and soups from the typical like stir fried spinach to the more unusual like duck hearts  which some loved and i didnt care for a true feast loved the modern blue and white decor agree with other reviewers that its a bit hard to find, ever since you enter the place it is just lovely you can see how they prepare the duck which is a mustorder dish the service is not extraordinary but it is totally worth it dishes and drinks are very well presented with a very good flavor do not skip dessert make reservations ahead, absolutely delicious roasted duck though its quite priceybetter to come for lunch than dinner because it usually is very crowded around dinner time comparing with wangfujings quan ji de its one of the best ones visited in nov 2013, da dong originally from beijing has ventured into shanghai the store is located atop the reel department store right outside jing an temple stop it has its own elevator so take note of that when drppping by also reservations are only until 630 and after that you have to try your luck at the queue our first attempt on a monday was a fail but tuesday wasnt as busy

the restaurant is best known for its sea cucumber and peking duck but dont let that stop you from ordering the other items

on our visit we first had the gong bao shrimp which was not too spicy the braised house special eggplant followed and it was really good the eggplant slices were as wide as pig trotters or mushrooms and you would think you were eating juicy soft meat

we then had the chestnut stewed ox tail which was stewed to perfection with the meat falling right off the bone

the highlight was of course the peking duck which was served with pancakes and a rice puff honestly the pancakes are a lot better thin and moist like freshly made dumpling dough it was just perfect for the flavours you would put in the condiments are in one platter consisting of black tangerine peel red pickled ginger orange melon green cucumber white leeks yellow garlic zest washed sugar and hoisin sauce putting them all together or to your liking will leave you with endless combinations of a peking duck roll

it is worth the wait as the crispy peking duck literally has no fat left in it completely rendered out through the cooking process and the meat is just so succulent, simply fantastic
having been to one of the dadong restaurants in beijing i was curious how this one in shanghai would measure up in a word it was fantastic
we went with a group of nine and had a private room in a back corner of the restaurant it was a first class room with its own bar and private bathroom
the peking duck exceptionally good at dadong was only part of the meal there was a giant spider crab a snapper clams in an ice sphere dalian beef just as good as wagyu i could scarcely believe it and a 22 day old roast duckling a feast in short
the cooking was perfect on every dish the service was in keeping with the setting and the food the timing of each dish was ideal i can�t say enough good about it i was sorry that i had eaten lunch that day i will return to this location, we couldnt find the restaurant as reel centre very confusing so arrived late our table was effectively in a corridor by kitchen so had all sorts of distractions and didnt feel as if we were in a restaurant atmosphere therefore was non existent menu quite confusing and if you mis ordered the bill could be astronomical that said you could not fault the food, first time da dong in shanghai after some visits to da dong in beijing as it has been a while it can be my feel but it seemed the duck here in shanghai tasted less crispy and was more fat also keep in mind that none of the waiters here speaks one single word english so to get recommendations from them on what to order is difficult however the menu is full of pictures so you can point it out overall it was good but in my mind its better in beijing, originally from beijing  chef da dong opened last year this new outlet in shanghai 
of course this location is not as charming as the original one in beijing  but the menu  huge choice  is the same  and nearly all dishes are here proposed in 3 sizes at different cost 
the beijing duck is of course a must roasted in hoven made in italy especially for chef dadong and signed dadong 
a place to go when you love chinese food  even if here all is big and lake of simplicity and discretion , executive summary

pros  the food quality is just as good as the one in beijing given this is a chain great service and ambience prices are reasonable for a finer dining experience mid to high

cons  none

top tip  book in advance and must order the peking duck party of 2 can easily finish half a duck, da dong is famous for its peking duck but it offers a lot more this is chinese cuisine at its best all dishes are not only presented in a nicer way that in your typical chinese restaurant but also taste better the peking duck is excellent with a very thin and crisp skin and all other dishes were very good too

the decor of the place is upscale and so are prices by chinese standards the service isnt bad but doesnt match the level of the place in other areas

so when in shanghai and craving for high end chinese food da dong is a good choice, new beautiful peking duck emporium beautiful place excellent food the duck is to die for excellent presentations most great food must make a reservation
not much english spoken but good service but worth a visit pricey, i went there for dinner with 20 colleagues and we had a nice room set for us thus it was quiet and we could really enjoy the dinner without being disturbed or without disturbing the others

we had a nice variety of dishes and i while i dont particularly remember one i know ive enjoyed it the duck was well done but so were others like soft peanuts spicy beef and shrimps

nothing special re the service but i had a good night more a 35 stars than 4 but definitely not a 3, i had the occasion da dongs roasted peking duck this was marvelous someone comes and slices the duck in front of you in very thin layers with a lot of skills
we could as well enjoy some chopped vegetable which was very good
the staff is helpful but really busy and the price is a bit high but it worth the experience, the duck at da dong is as good as everyone says but bad service can ruin a meal when we arrived they wanted us to eat the set westerner menu as they found that is what tourists like best we are adventurous eaters though and wanted to order off the menu they kept insisting for over 10 minutes that we choose the set menu even though we said we did not want it they then proceeded to ignore us for at least 20 minutes after that as they did not want to deal with us

after we ordered though everything went smooth the duck was great although not as good as 1949 and the back waiter that was supporting our table was excellent but the bad initial experience made me wish we had gone somewhere else that evening, i visited this restaurant with a large group so we ordered just about everything on the menu the dishes were unique and very well presented the duck was perfectly prepared and had the most consistent browning pattern i have ever seen on a duck entree i thought the beef with peppers was one of the best dishes

service was spectacular pricey, the first time i went to a dadong restaurant it was a great experience it was new and there was a lot of hype over its opening in shanghai however i was very disappointed with my last visit nov 2014 food was okay you would expect more for the price and service was terrible the duck took more than 1 hour to be served and they offered to make a soup with the bones which we had to remind them to serve the chef carving the duck was also a trainee you would not expect this from a hiend restaurant charging the prices this place does
i dont think i will be going back to this restaurant, on my last shanghai trip i heard that da dong had opened in shanghai so i had to try decor is very nice but we ended up down a narrow hallway which was a through fare for the server staff to get to the back service was good food overall was good i find it interesting that they can even justify an additional charge for the pancakes plum sauce and other accompaniments in addition to the very pricey duck it wouldnt be traditional peking duck without them now down to the duck itselfpresentation was nice the skin if eaten by itself was amazing the meat was indeed extra lean to the point it was tough and chewy and except for the salty brine flavour which i like it was pretty flavourless  it was also cold  i am glad i went for the experience but would not repeat for the dollars there are too many other great options in shanghai, a nice highend duck restaurant but its for the tourists very very expensive and theres better duck to be had in beijing i highly recommend the peking duck at na jia restaurant outside the north gate of art 798 also on the pricy side ill admit but excellent atmosphere much quieter than dadong and the duck is better

ive been here several times with family and with friends and everyone loves it, very impressed with the presentation of the food the dishes were superbly crafted to let feel you want to have taste of the fine dishes prepared for you the peking duck was very good and a must try item in the menu","Mexican cuisine",0.699996385356116
112,"nice to have a night of easy western food and the view is great but its nothing more beyond that service was well intended but overly so  waiters so keen to pour drinks that they kept mixing them in our glasses, we went to pop bar for some pre dinner drinks as we had a reservation later that night in metcato same building different floor drinks were nice abd the view over the bund as well will certainly come back when the wheather is warmenough for outdoor drinks i saw the pop brasserie was very busy as well when i passed it maybe will make acreservation there in future, we are about to move to shanghai and reckon this restaurant will be one of our go to places for a special meal or night out with friends and family the dining room is trendy but comfortable with a busy but relaxed atmosphere we had the sharing menu for five people and the food was varied very well cooked and delicious the steaks and burgers are equally good and you can enjoy a drink in the bar with the legendary views of the bund the service is unobtrusive and efficient a lovely night out and good value for all that is on offer at pop, i went there a couple of times and i have really like it
expensive but you also pay the view of the bund which is amazing
you can go at anytime tea time is really good and at night it is very nice to have a drink with you friends, i was a little sceptical about visiting this restaurantbar due to some reviews on ta however our food burgers and ny steak were as good as the views from the terrace no sitting outside due to cold weather but you can still enjoy the view across the river, it is worth to have a drink here to benefit of the beautiful view from the terrace
good service and price in the average
open till late evening, came here for dinner booked a table near the window so i got a table near the bar lol
then i asked the staff why and they didnt care and was more like you want it or not gm no where to be found hiding
food average
drinks average
view amazing
get rid of the service drinks and food and you have a good looking restaurant
prices are ridiculous, wonderful the restaurant is really nice  the view is unforgettable the food was really good , lovely views great service at dinner lovely food will not be the cheapest but thats what to expect when you are at any establishment on the bund we started with drinks at the bar took in the views then adjourned for dinner later
shared the tomahawk cant recall what exact name of dish was a caesar salad and scallops all were fantastic david was very good with his suggestion on wines thank you, one of the best places on the bund the view is phenomenal the food service  atmosphere top notch my favorite place, undoubtedly one of the places in the bund that offers fantastic nighttime views perfect picture for those who want the iconic scenes of the boats plying the river and the nicely lit buildings on either side the restaurant is nicely decorated and a great range of alcohol including whiskies unfortunately the food is on the whole average i think the grilled meats especially the beef is not bad the fish selection is good never ever order the pork neck as it is swimming in oil appetizers are quite decent on the whole i think this is an average experience you can get the same nice views elsewhere too, we didnt go out specifically looking for western food but were wandering the bund and were drawn to the lights twinkling on the rooftop bar we werent disappointed spectacular views good decor and the food was pretty good large portions lamb was a full rack and would have been plenty for two so go easy on the sides and unless you are very very hungry you probably dont need to bother with a starter the service was a little overattentive they seemed to be refilling our glasses every time we had a sip but apart from that the ambiance was delightful wine was extremely expensive but i think thats pretty standard in shanghai overall we really enjoyed the experience and found it a great place to soak up the views of pudong, we had about 10 at our table on a business junket
its a nice place and the food is satisfactory the wine is good too and we had plenty of it
however at 11pm after our main courses we were the only table left and were informed the kitchen was closed so we needed to pay and leave so we did
what a strange experience, it was a very windy night a typhoon had just past further south off the coast of china but we started off with cocktails on the outdoor terrace bar and the views of the river and buildings opposite the bund were magnificent three on the bund is itself a beautiful older building with stunning architecture pop has a nice modern bistro vibe with very friendly staff and the maitre d was especially helpful in then getting us a nice table inside for dinner we did have reservations which i always recommend food was very good and when one of our steaks was overdone he offered a new one but we were ok with that so he then gave us free desserts and dessert martinis one thing to keep in mind when wanting to see the views and the buildings lit up is that many of the buildings turn off their lights around 10 pm also getting taxis in shanghai can be very challenging  even when at a restaurant or hotel many drivers will try to overcharge and remember the metro stops at 11pm, obviously the key selling feature to this place is its rooftop patio off the bund with a great view the food was really good service in english and pretty cocktails greeted by western staff in our case a cute scot hip atmosphere mostly western clientele and much of the food ingredients are imported ie my fish was from norway only complaint was that some items were a little overpriced and the mixed drinks werent the quickest to arrive however if you want a nice rooftop spot to eat on the bund this is a great choice, had supper tonight and really enjoyed the meal ambience and service on the bund and has a rooftop patio which overlooks the hangpu river across to pudong at night lights are beautiful on the buildings food was very delicious especially the scallop dish started with clam chowder soup light and not creamy service was impeccable and staff very knowledgeable well worth a visit, if you tire of the food on offer in shanghai and want something a bit more western pop is a good choice located on the bund a very popular tourist spot pop gives great views of the city from the fifth floor spot at number 5 the food is reasonably priced and of good quality and portions are more american in size than european whcih is more common in shanghai there are plenty of tables inside and out and even at a reasonably busy time in the evening we did not have to book, we came here as a group of five on a summer night
this is a swanky spot with an amazing view of the city, it could have been because the sight of a 6 year old in our group made the wait staff uneasy and we went largely ignored which was surprising because of its location at three on the bund but seriously  we we there at 630  not a busy time by any means and it took some aggressive armwaving antics and fuyuan calls to get the attention of our waiter besides the service that sucked the views were outstanding food was alright with a nice wine list to drown our sorrow of bad service, the view was the reason why i picked this place for my cocktails and i havent been disappointed however the cocktail are not tasty at all i expected something better in term of beverage quality as well as the service could be more professional raise up your hand its unfortunately the only way to get their attention, a friend of mine recommended me this restaurant and i have to say its very good the views of pu dong are amazing and the food was delicious specially if you have been travelling around asia for a while i ate gazpacho and salmon and both were amazing
service is also good, good for nights out nice atmosphere very different inside there is a little tower you can go up so plan one night for visiting it  no clubbing gust a bar and lounge, get the best of colonial and modern shanghai with this beautiful terrasse food is western as the name implies and is quite ok we had steaks so hardly a testimony to the chefs creativity we mostly enjoyed the setting and the view, amazing view from the balcony interior design also impressive very nice atmosphere
all this makes hard for the food to compete
we had some oysters that were ok
also the beef carpaccio was nice
main dishes were a disappointed fish was dry and lacking taste
asked for an espresso at the end  it was bad very bad
not cheap, i went here with work colleagues 10 of us and got mixed reviews from everyone on their food i had the wagyu burger which was ok not bad
the wine and desserts were ok too
the view is spectacular and service is very good, you definately visit this place because of its view over both the bund and pudong skyline the view is also obviously what you payed for as the food was really poor compared to the price range the meat was dry and the portions small besides that the service was good id recommend visiting their bar instead for good drinks and equally good views instead of going there for dinner, we went there on our first evening in shanghai it was dark out side and we had a really good view the restaurant was cozy and there was a lot of people and the staff was friendly and helpful

we did have a litte trouble finding the entrance to pop but luckily a friendly soul pointed us in the right direction

the quality of the food was really good we had seabass and a classic burger to drink we had two of the president the plates was not that big and you are able to find cheaper and just as goodtasty food other places in shanghai that being said im glad we went to pop  it was a really good and tasty experience, we did not want to do fine dining and not too many foreign restaurant choice in waitan so we checked the menu and decided to try pop so glad we did service was excellent we had some special requests due to allergy and they took it in and made it perfectly without messing it up or asking stupid questions very attentive and food was excellent i had a lobster risotto my sons tried fois gras burger and fish and chips my husband tried steak they are all excellent definitely recommend this, had a burger for lunch it was a really mediocre standard it was on a national holiday so maybe unexperienced staff in the kitchen some of the service staff was most likely new for the day
the view from the outdoor seating area is really nice, we met friends for brunch on sundaythe views from the terrace look right over the bundwe had the fixed brunch menu at <u+00a5>288 which was good value for the class of establishmentthe gazpacho was excellent and the grilled salmon and the french toast with sausage was very tasty but the sausage was impossible to cut
the service was good and it was a very pleasant venue on the 7 th floor , i took my friend here for dinner on a monday night and we were very well looked after the service was good and really friendly the sommellier gave me the details of where my very very lovely californian chardonnay had come from i had a steak with mash which was nice and my friend had fish and chips which was very generous there was a set menu which looked quite competitive but we both fancied something from the main menu

the views are great if you want to take some photos walk round to the front of the private dining room which has an unobstructed view of the bund

loved the wine best glass ive had in shanghai the food was good and the service very friendly great place for dinner with friends, very nice view for this restaurant that has not many other things to offer
terrace is really beautiful and you have an option to dine inside the tower for a privateone table service
service and food taste not more than average
quite expensive for what it is worth the view, did lunch here and was very impressed staff were good and lunchtime menu a great price and food didnt disappoint we had coffee on the amazing terrace on a warm march day in shanghai at night the view will be very impressive
i had a look at the speak easy bar and look forward to going back and enjoying a cocktail or two in what were very luxurious surroundings, you enter the pop brasserie from a side entrance it already looks more expensive on the weekend you will probably need a reservation we went there on saturday for brunch two dishes for one person cost about 230 rmb no drinks included except for water but i have to say it was really tasty especially the appetizer was soo good all dishes we could choose for brunch were western like scrambled eggs gnocchi with salmon pancakes the service was okay
so if you want to dine more exclusively this is probably the right place, we were heading to mercato and decided on the spurn of the moment to venture up to the top floor and try pop we werent disappointed
the service was impeccable
we proceeded to have a drink at the terrace before dinner and eventhough it was a tad cold the wait staff was quick to turn on the outdoor heater
we order the burratta the chef recommended duck confit and the tenderloin
the burratta was simply marvelous i thought the duck confit could have used a little less salt  the steak was a very delightful cut of meat

all in all a very pleasant and satisfying experience

tip if you enjoy a cigar or two after dinner head over to whispers their little speakeasy cigar bar hidden in the corner, sunshine has returned to shangahi and what better place to spend my day than at pop

the manager remembered our party from our previous visit and straightaway arranged the best table on the terrace even though they were fully booked bravo

lunch menu excellent value with a 2 course menu starting at 138rmb i started with the ceviche and then onto the flank steak brilliant

we were all so full after the lunch but we managed to squeeze in a sundae to share which was a delight

still one of my favourites on the bund, terrible food  nothing on a plate  ceviche on set menu is 2 forks  sea bass awful no taste  dessert dont take  why  just because we wait 1 h 30 min  yes lunch time  anyway service bad  managing bad  only 1 person be quiet good his name is barbaros  music terrible  i m very sick of this place where they think is everything about the view and atmosphere  i will never recommend this place  and i m so happy too not sale any wine to this restaurant  that the problem to take some staff how are not ready for this kind of place  anyway i very very disappointed  like usual you complain and they dont care , have been to this place before about 8 years ago was called those these new heights place more or less look the same view is fantastic fro the restaurant overseeing the bund with its light boats and the illuminating view to the skyline of the city center  ordered chef special menu
very simple starter with shrimps  after very pale clam showder steak was imported good meat but was served out too late from kitchen so was called after complaining the pre heated it so instead of medium rare got a medium steak but warm
beer served after 30 minutes with excuses so free of house
cheese cake tasted liked industrialised one ice cream very nice espresso below average no crema too bitter and not fresh
overall disappointing as i have had great dinners here 8 years ago, we went for the chinese new year special that we found on timeoutshanghaicom at 288rmb per person it was a steal i added 2 glasses of wine for an additional 118rmb the best food was the appetizers the salmon bruschetta was great the main course was lacking in my opinion it was fried seafood basket and then steak and french fries dessert was a nice end note it was geared towards westerners i wish the menu offered a little piece of chinese tradition considering the holiday my friend ordered the diva drink and it was 198rmb that was way to pricy for a single drink the restaurant decor is nice and sleek the views of pudong and the pearl tower were outstanding, great restaurant with incredible views had a nice chefs menu my wife had the burger it was stellar server i think his name was lewis was great very friendly and super attentive james brown soundtrack was an awesome touch feel good spot, cool place on the top of the building on the riverside with amazing view kiwi cocktail is really nice and burgers are tasty when the weather is fine i would recommend to sit outside on the terrace and chill at the bar they also serve branches there, this restaurant is located in the 3 building on the bund so the views are fantastic the menu is fairly limited think up market surf and turf i guess because of the location the price tag is suprisingly higher than expected waiters not as on the ball as i would like given the calibre of the restaurant good non alcoholic cocktails as well as alcoholic if you want just bar snacks they do serve food on the terrace but remember to reserve a table ive been to this restaurant twice for a business dinner and it has never been too busy i couldnt get a table so i guess i would say if you are a fairly plain eater and want an amazing view this is the place for you, � a very good choice its central the food selection and preparation was considerably outstanding and the location as such is quite attractive, incredible view of the bund from this rooftop restaurant the food is good but the real show is the view of the city i dont know why anyone would want to sit inside a nice addition is the wellstocked cigar bar great stop for a meal or premeal, i went with a friend for brunch
the weather was tricky so we sat indoors we didnt enjoyed the view that much however the space has good natural light

suddenly the music was too loud we asked the management to lowered it a bit and they nicely did it
they have to set prices <u+00a5>208 for 2 courses or <u+00a5>258 for 3 courses

two courses is more than enough unless you train for marathons
we picked the salmon poached eggs with hollandaise sauce the serving was a bit cold also coffee is not included and its kind of ok not spectacular as i would have expected

i guess the view worths to be seen around 7 pm when the lights are on in the bund and the pudong skyline, i have been here a few times and the general manager ahmed is always very friendly and helpful the location is amazing with a beautiful rooftop bar which can be closed off if the weather gets a bit cooler, we ate here with a group of six the views are spectacular many other reviewers have done a great job explaining this the bund at night is very well seen from the terrace

unfortunately the food was average to slightly below average if you are craving american food you may be tempted to come here be warned its a little expensive for what you get portions are okay and the food was presented well

this place is extremely trendy has decent music that is neither loud nor too quiet the service is average and there are plenty of english speakers about you must make reservations especially to sit outside this restaurant is not worth trying unless you eat outside, i went with my friend for dinteresse good terrace but very normal food as the location is great i think they should give some dishes less expected fishchips was full of fries and only 2 small piece of fish normal wine selection but malbec glass was great, visit this place at night for the most amazing views of the bund ever we arrived about 600 and got great seats on the terrace over looking the river and bund we had cocktails and hot snacks and were treated to the most fantastic light show ever service is spot on and the decor and facilities first class loved it im sure it will become a modern day shanghai institution go while there are still seats, we reserved a friday night table for 4 at pop being an american expat ive never gone out of my way to find american food in china so i went in with an open mind and flexible expectations also having been a frequent patron of former occupant new heights i was curious to see what had been done to transform the space into an american brasserie

first impressions werent great the main dining area now crammed with tiny 4top tables was completely deserted most of the tables outside were occupied we were seated at a indoor table which we quickly discovered was nearly incapable of containing all of our plates and glasses when we asked to move to a larger table near a window we were told the table was reserved for the restaurants owners we watched that table  and the rest of the dining room for the next 15 hours  and we were the only people seated inside at all during that time

steaks occupy a large portion of pops menu so two were ordered for our table  one a wagyu filet the other a new york strip a roast chicken plate and several appetizers were also ordered along with several bottles of wine the food with the exception of a smoked salmon plate pretty hard to screw that up ranged from boring to awful the steaks were tough and chewy the appetizers and chicken uninspired having just returned from a trip in japan were pretty certain pops wagyu is not the real deal

with a disappointing dinner finished we asked about being moved to the bar area for an afterdinner drink at this point we were told that an outdoor table would require an additional 2000rmb spend  on top of the 2500 wed already spent on dinner and wine when going over to view bar tables i was brushed aside by a bar manager who told the waitress with me in chinese that the choice interior table could not be ours he acted as if i wasnt standing right in front of them

at this point we finally got the message and decided to leave

before leaving we politely expressed our dissatisfaction to our waitress and a passing manager but were ignored no apologies no offer to remedy our complaints nothing

wed wondered on arrival why the place was empty after this experience we have the painful answer pop is a sad waste of a beautiful space but we should expect it will soon go pop and be replaced by something superior","Turkish cuisine",0.999606667695962
113,"solid ipa awesome outdoor patio clean bathrooms overall nice pit stop in the former french concession happy hour has nice prices and it is happy hour all day on mondays, we walked to the donghu lu branch after discovering the dongping lu branch was closed what a nice surprise this one looks slightly smaller than the dongping lu branch but well thought out in design we tried just about every beer on the menu and a couple of whiskies though the ipas could be slightly more bitter the rest of the beers have come into their own since the last time i was in shanghai the food served was good and serving sizes larger than normal for shanghai a good mix of local chinese expats and some visiting  laid back after work crowd, good happy hour from 48 pm on weekends try one of the brewers ciders food is good standard american style bar food try the buffalo wings

smoking allowed on the first floor, this place at donghu road seems to be a branch of shanghai brewery although the place do not appear in their official webpage

i have been disappointed in shanghai brewery as they have downgraded their glass size and thus tried to cheat their guests and served smaller beers for same price this have happened in their shanghai brewery dongping road department  this place at dongping road is currently closed

but but  this place shanghai brewery at donghu road is a positive surprise
the place bears the stamp of the original shanghai i loved
here they have the glass size of the right pint size

here are friendly  helpful and quick responsive staff
here is the good beer and reasonable food for the price

a good place to relax in the heart of the city
if they keep their standard and level so i have rediscovered shanghai brewery as one of my favorite places to go  but i will choose this place shanghai brewery donghu road, this place is the place to be it might not be that genuine but the beers we had were amazing and brewed in shanghai the steak was one of the best steaks ive ever had go here, it is a bar there is indoor and outdoor seating the menu is a mix of chinese and western food there are many expats hanging out here, since i frequently stay at donghu hotel i often go across the street for some beers n bites at the sh brewery the beers are good there is happy hour and friendly prompt waiterswaitresses as food they serve pasta pizza steaks ribs nachos salads and more, shanghai brewery is the one of favorite places in shanghai nice decoration really good beer and food they have food promo every monday and tuesdayburgers 1+1 happy hour for beer every day before 8pm try north star ipa it is the best, really cool retro decor a nice atmosphere excellent beer choices and in a cool part of town well worth a visit, i was looking for somewhere walkable from the hotel in shanghai to get something to eat when i saw a micro brew i had to try it the amber is smooth unfiltered and satisfying i have had great local cuisine already with 12 more days in the region i opted for a bbq chicken flat bread pizza for a taste of home it was recommended by the waitress who spoke english well the pizza was very good it had caramelized onions avocado fried shoe string onions cheese and chicken of course and a nice spicy after bite they have english menu and outdoor seating if u want a change of pace for eats give it a try, stopped in this place for a beer and tried their pilsner it was ok nothing special but very drinkable also had a burger and fries that were pretty good but pricey ~100 yuan, went here for first time this week was pleasantly surprised with the good quality of food and the beer is good  i only tried the ipa our party had pizza a burger and wings everyone was pleased with there meals beers were about 35 rmb pizza and others about 100 rmb will definitely come here again, great place for american food and beer lots of micro brews and draft beers food are reasonably priced generous potion sizes and tastes good thats why they were packed on a saturday night with their neighbors having thinner crowds you can order nachos  fajitas burgers fries pizzas etc, my girlfriend and i met at the university of wisconsin so naturally beer is important to us we were visiting her parents in shanghai this july and were excited to see what beer shanghai had to offer

our hotel had samplings of tsingtaos attempts at a stout weiss and amber ale but none hit the spot we also tried a place in hangzhou that promised germanstyle beers but those were lacking as well

we had read that shanghai brewery was good but we still had our doubts one night we decided to put it to the test and shanghai brewery definitely passed

the beers were very much american in style with the stout being very good and memorable the touted kiwi beer was fine but not to our tastes

in addition to the beer the food was delicious we had calamari and wings that were both well presented and tasted great

next time we go to shanghai we are definitely coming back here, if you are into micro brews and you just want a really nice pplace to hang out for the night this is it i have been to the other shanghai brews but i like this one the best it is still in a neighborhood and has a great outdoor seating area the beer speaks for itself if you are a lover of micro brews they always have something new and seasonal on tap
they had a peach beer that was really tasty of course you can get a pilsner or ipa but i like to taste the new experiment stuff food is really good a very diverse menu will suite all from burgers to pizza braised pork knuckle sauer bratten bangers and mashed bbq ribs even a few mexican dishes something to please everyone this is not set up like a sports bar like the others so you have less of the sport crowd screeming and yelling throughout lending for a more relaxing and toned down atmoshere outside late cool night excellent, the restaurant is pretty good and reasonably priced especially for western style food which can be poor and overpriced in shanghai the food was both plated well and cooked well even though the menu is basic the food is finished well the place is roomy and the staff friendly  just a little inattentive but in general pretty good all in all a good experience what the food lacks the beer makes up for give it a try, very good beers from draft ambers and ipa
western dishes nachos hamburgers and something with oriental taste everything very good
many people of all the world
nice, the beer was good and the menu was extensive although i did not eat there outside seating was surrounded by trees even though it was close to a major street
this place is worth a look, chicken and waffle sandwich looked appealing but once i dug in turned out to be grissly fatty dark meatnot what i expected, the food from this restaurant and the ambience has been the highlight of my stay in china i look forward to it every friday i have eaten a burger and a club sandwich at this restaurant totally worth the price and that beer mmm dive inn, big selection of home brew plus lots of imported bottles theres a nice outside area which is great for lunch with kids happy our started at 1500, the food here is delicious offering up a place to relax shanghai garden is located on donghu road in the french concession there is an outdoor seating area and plenty of seating inside dont come here for a quiet place but instead come to chat merrily with friends

the beer is very good and especially good for china after happy hour beers cost about $10 for 350ml expensive but average for a craft or imported beer in china

the food is western and fusion there are plenty of selections to choose from including building your own pizza or burger i built my own burger with avocado and garlic sauce gruyere and jalapenos even the bun was delicious with black and white sesame seeds on top

the waiter did everything a western tourist would expect took drink orders first brought out appetizers and checked on us regularly when our burgers took awhile to come out the waiter came by at the end of the meal to applogize and gave us a free dessert we got tiramisu

if you want some good food great beer and a lively atmosphere for a reasonable price then shanghai brewery is for you, the drinks are quite expensive if you miss out on happy hour and the food is extremely expensive the service can be a bit slow sometimes too the food was good but this is a restaurant i dont see myself coming back to anytime soon, so worth a visit to the beautiful neighborhood and the building for the brewery is a gorgeous historic place that fits right in beers were really great as was the marguerite pizza and chicken pasta definitely worth a stop in for craft beer enthusiasts as usual there are a lot of staff standing around chatting and texting long after your pint is drained so youve gotta speak up to get served, living in sh i frequented shanghai brewery all 3 actually great place for westerners to meet up and mingle food is western apple cider beer is my favorite i would go for both lunch dinner and a good hh it is family oriented good vibe good western music, this branch of shanghai brewery opened relatively recently and was a pleasant surprise the place is very classy and has a deliberate 1920s art deco vibe the menu is slightly different from the other locations and feature more cocktails they also seem to have several beers that are unique to this place my personal favourite being the cherry porter balanced and not overly sweet

a great place to chill out in the heart of the city it would be great for dates and is also very family friendly during the day best staff of all the shanghai brewery restaurants which is a high standard to beat, we wanted to try shanghai beer and we were not disappointed the place looks cool good vibe the shanghai brewery ipa beer was very good as was the white ipa brew they have won some beer awards in the states and australia we also found the menu to be good the nachos were good and even had mangoes on them compliments to the beef tataki and the best burger we had in china, this branch is new but feels old they have a nice selection of craft beers and a broad casual menu burgers steaks chicken salads pasta and bar snacks are delicious and the servers are fast and efficient probably because the managers keep an attentive eye on things it was comfortable for several solo and family meals and there is an outdoor terrace for nice weather  but the traffic on narrow donghu rd makes that noisy and not very restful good location a block from iapm mall and the metro station check out the newly designed donghu park across the street, spent a couple of afternoon happy hours here twoforone drinks and reasonable appetizers ground floor bar area is spacious with views to the street and attentive servers the only downside is that smoking is allowed insideits what made us leave both times, we were impressed with the shanghai brewery we went for the beer which was spot on and we liked the whole place attractive and the menu had a little bit of a gourmet twist we really enjoyed it and it was not expensive especially compared ot some of the other places we went to while in shanghai","steakhouse",0.977553090135457
114,"go early evening for a good seat so that after dark you can enjoy night view of the bund area so beautiful the food was also perfectly cooked and delicious it was not traditional chinese but very usinternational i had halibut and my colleagues had salmon delish we also enjoyed appetizers and dessert we had fun as a work group but i would have loved to make this date night with my husband you could walk the bund after, had lunch after a tourist city tour it is a very nice place quiet with very good food and an amazing visit of the shanghai skyline, nice spot in the north of the bund to enjoy sunrise or sunset and the bund view located in old sassoon warehouse building

service is good and the food is ok but nothing with a taste that one would grave

the best dishes they have are the desserts like pannacotta and cheese cake, had lunch here on a recent business trip to shanghai sat outside as it was a nice day with decent air quality i had the tomato soup which was really good i only had the soup but the menu has many offerings that looked good service was very friendly and efficient very enjoyable close by our shanghai office so ill be back , the restaurant has a stunning view of the shanghai skyline the food is good but service seemed a little slow the bar is full service with a decent looking wine menu for those in town for business they also host small gatherings for a happy hour and cocktail reception that worked out well for my company, nice location to have a decent drink or dinner good view in the river easy music in the background all good with dinner starting at 200 rmb and a 500ml hoegaarden for 90 rmb it is not a cheap location but worth a visit, the restaurant had a great terrace with view to the lujiazui area the pearl tower is right in front of it and most of the west side buildings can be seen from there the food is very good and prices are not crazy the ambient is nice and can be elegant in the closed area very nice place to have a business or family  friends dinner, yes you can eat hear but we didnt its a great place to start the evening with great views across the bund, the restaurant has the most beautiful view and offers a delicious western and japanese food

ideal for a romantic dinner a business dinner or to bring visitors in town who want a break from chinese food anyway if you want the view on shanghai you have to eat western

the food was a great surprise the first time i went there and it keeps on being so delicious my favorites are the tomato soup just amazing their beef rossini and the legendary lava cake

an overall amazing experience and a very warm and friendly staff that is also something rare around here, we went as a group and as a treat a treat it was the ambiance lovely the food superb and the service great a must to visit the view something not to be missed with great food and service, dinner on the terrace offers a sensational view with the tv tower right in the middle the atmosphere is therefore very good the food is also delicious and the service is friendly, we went here for our anniversary dinner and loved everything about this restaurant the staff went above and beyond to serve us well and even gave us a beautiful dessert for our anniversary we ordered sushi and scallops as starters the lobster and halibut for dinner and the red velvet cake for dessert everything was nicely portioned beautifully presented and so delicious the ambiance of the restaurant was classy and romantic and although there was an event on the terrace and glass room so we were inside the views were still wonderful would highly recommend this place and plan to go there again, i have had both dinner and lunch at kathleens they have a nice selection of seafood as well as other dishes food is great
the view is one of the better you can have over hangpu river the reason is the angle which allows you to see both the pudong skyline and the bund side of the river, recomended
pretty good food and spectacular view good during rainy weather i loved the atmosphere there i dont understand those tea sets a few little cakes with a cup of tea for 150 rmb but its ok  good for fine dining really, this is one of my favourite restaurants in shanghai they offer some stunning views of the hangpu river due to the location you will see both the bund side as well as the pudong skyline
i have visited twice once for dinner and once for lunch the menu has a good selection of seafood such as sushi fresh oysters etc
it is not a cheap place but reasonable for the view and the food quality
highly recommended for both business or private dining, our group had dinner here and it was a great experience it is the only restaurant right on the rivers edge right across from pudong with great views you can also see the grand old buildings on the bund downriver the building used to be an opium warehouse back in the day so it has the old shanghai feeling to it the menu had a good selection of asian and western dishes food quality and service were both very good i highly recommend it, great views and lovely setting on a balmy summers evening but expensive for dinner even for a special occasion looked like people were lingering over drinks and plates of french fries sushi starters to enjoy the outdoor experience without the huge outlaywould maybe try lunch as reviews say more reasonably priced, fantastic view of the bund and very nice food too
all in out party were very happy with the food good fish and excellent meat western style i had the 3 course menu and can really recommen it
the wine that was recommended was maybe not top class bu otherwise it was a great experience
and the view, i came for corporate dinner at the end of a conference so the menu was prearranged and therefore i cannot comment on the menu selection the bar service was very good and service generally remained quite attentive all evening however the food served that evening was rather tasteless and uninteresting would not very good by chinese standards, the view is really fantastic on the shanghai light close to the river and the restaurant itself is ok the service was also quite good in the right timing and professional but really disappointed by the food no taste and really expensive the only thing i appreciated was the tiramisu who was ok the rest from the seafood entry to the kingprawn in garlic who to much cooked and with a sauce without any interest as the pasta and sushi nothing fine even for this meals so simple to succeed it was less than average really need an improvment, when visiting it quickly became apparent that his is a high class restaurant the staff offers excellent service and the food definitely meets expectations as well the steaks served were of good quality and the fish we ordered bordered on perfection, staff was polite and quick the view was great international kitchen with food from all over the world except china i never had sushiroll as a starter with bread and butter the food was very expensive there must be better places with more reasonable prices no local specialties which we missed considering the beautifull local view on the surrounding riverside and pudong area, firstly  the view of the bund here is incredible right on the riverfront in front of the pearl tower lots of seating options inside and out

service was very good for china ie meals all came at the same time and drinks regularly topped up apart from one waiter who was a bit rough always barging over my shoulder to top up drinks  deal with plates

had sashimi salad followed by salmon salmon was nice but could have done with some veg or something on the side  but i suppose you can order this as a side dish

3 others at our table had steak  all cuts looked great but rotisserie would be my choice, spectacular views great service reasonable food without being amazing wine was ok the views are why you would go here, this restaurant has an amazing view over the skyline of pudong side besides this the food is amazing not cheap both worth it really really good, great view of the pudong financial area food is fine nothing special a bit overpriced but i guess you are paying for the view the service was actually quite good even the guy was not very presentable uniform haircut etc but was very attentive its side bund but the view even better from there at some point we sat on a terrace on sunday morning can smoke there too, arriving late evening we asked the concierge of our hotel for a recommendation of a restaurant in walking distance he send us to kathleens and we were totally surprised to find such a beautiful place in a small tiny road and average building  you have a fantastic view over both sides of the river the bund and pudong with the pearl tower the ambience is nice and cosystaff is great though english is not their favourite language food wine and atmosphere were great not cheap but absolutely worth we will come again for sure  especially because they have a nice outdoor area , its hard to have a bad seat in this place the main dining room has 3 walls of floorceiling windows it is situated just next to hyatt on the bund on the bend in the river so you are looking directly at the pearl tower and can appreciate old bund on puxi side and new bund on pudong side at the same time the contrast at night is very beautiful

service is very attentive some of the wait staff have very limited english but if you run into problems the more senior staff speak very good english the manager came to our table while we were there just to greet us he kindly arranged for a custom meal for a child in our party as there is no kids menu

food was very good with large portions the menu is mostly seafood and steak including sushi  sashimi i had the baked cod with lentils it was perfectly cooked others had steak lobster beef carpaccio and tiger prawns everybody was very happy with their meals

i would recommend this for a business dinner a date the tables are well spaced lighting is dark or for outof town guests you would like to impress with the view, we had booked to have dinner here but were so disappointed with the menu that we decided to have a bottle of wine and head elsewhere i cant comment on the food as i didnt have any but the wine was of a high standard and the bar snacks provided were good the views from here over to pudong skyline are magical staff were very friendly and its just ashame we didnt like the menu and thats the only reason i cant rate higher, the location is nice with a good view across the river on the pudong side with its magnificent illuminated towers food and service quality is good but quite expensive we were there for a business dinner would go again, we came here on a sunday for brunch although the brunch menu is shorter than the lunch menu our pick was still tasty and healthy the service was very good they never forgot anything and were really helpful with everything next time we want to try the lunch menu which has a very nice deal, this restaurant might be a bit off track as it doesnt really counts as bund but it has some of the best views if you ask me the food quality is good and the restaurant setting is very classy but yet very approachable

i was here for a group dinner and it is a perfect private venue location as well if you take the private room seats easily up to 30 pax and the steak i had was really good, food and service is excellent views of the bund and pudong  pearl tower is amazingatmosphere is elegant, slightly rundown neighborhood but once you head up to the restaurant the view is wonderful food and drinks are pretty good prices are reasonable went here for brunch and the menu is comparable to other places around shanghai, super view of the river and pudong sites very creative sushi super steak well prepared and presented food, did not eat hear but went for a drink on a clear night and really enjoyed the view highly recommend for the bund views, really impressive view of both sides of the bund and directly across from the pearl tower they have a lovely large terrace for outdoor seating as well as two indoor rooms one encased in glass walls its one of the least impeded views on the puxi side of the river food was very good  i had salmon  which i normally dont enjoy  and loved it preparation was perfect would definitely take out of town guests to this one, in short they refused to give me a receipt after a good meal and told me to call their lawyer if not happy

this is a sad and silly story i brought 2 colleagues to this restaurant as we were staying in a nearby hotel we had a great evening and a great meal actually it was so far the best meal we had in shanghai

its a bit pricey but ok you get your money worth i paid the meal with my credit card 10 minutes later we left  they didnt give me a receipt or my credit card paper slip i realized it in the taxi and my colleagues simply suggested i send them an email as i was flying out the very next morning

me thanks for the great food nice evening  can you please take a snapshot of my receipt i gave all the details for my administration it was work related

them quote we cant help you sorry

me again a bit more assertive please search your archive and send me my receipt a scan is fine

them our manager tony is not agree to do so sorry sir

and the tones raises until by law you ate and with your willings sic you have paid sir if any case will come up our lawyers will take care of it

really so im askingwarning anyone going there what could possibly make them respond something like this this sounds way too fishy i just involved american express to help me out here, i really recommend this place the terrasse is very pleasant with a different view of the river compared to the traditional bund view
went for a fixed lunch where everything was well presented impeccable service and smiles everywhere a westerner manager was present to correct the little mistakes as the waiters had a tendency to give the preference to serving first wine and drinks and forget about water
all in all a place i will visit again for a one on one lunch without hesitation, went for dinner with 11 people for a special occasion we arrived and it took 20 minutes to be asked if we wanted a drink 30 minutes to get a menu and it was really slow and drinks coming all over the place finally ordered food sharing tuna  salmon rolls were served all confused no idea who had what a main course came out at the same time and french fries worse than fast food and cold then the main courseshocking 4 orders of steak but only two came waited for others one came then finally 4th was served raw and cold in the middle the taste of the dishes i have to say was really really good i would recommend the tuna roll  steak with fois gras however the night was so stressful the table having to instruct the waitors the manager was very apologetic gave 2 bottles of wine and additional free drinks however my bill was <u+00a3>50 and i wouldnt go again great view and foodterrible service, this is a nice restaurant and bar with a great view of the famous shanghai financial district skyline a good restaurant italian kitchen ankd nice food also excellent sushi rolls we had here a drink and took some appetizeers weve enjoyed it very much

also a nice teraace outside, this place is right on the water with great views of lujiazui its not easy to find tell the cab driver its next to the hyatt on the bund in bei waitan its a nice place for girls lunch as you can sit there and chat away they offer a 2course or 3course lunch menu with very reasonable price waitresses are nice and service is fast they dont have vegetarian dishes on the menu but they made a special eggplant plate for my vegetarian friend the high ceiling and floortoceiling glass windows make this place very pleasant its also a good place for big group dinners or events, we had a birthday party at kathleen waitan with 10+ people so we had an fixed menu with 2 hour free flow of wine and beer
the food was very nice and the wine as well the wine we had at first was not nice at all but they changed it for us after we said something about it
the restaurant has a really nice view really worth it its a bit expensive for chinese standards however for shanghai its quite normal
i definitely recommend this restaurant to have a drink or a nice meal, the view was awesome from this rooftop restaurant

they also have a atrium room glass walls  ceiling which makes the view visible from much of the restaurant

we booked the entire restaurant for our large group the food being made for so many was simply ok i expect it would be better for a small group, i went there to meet an old friend of mine
the place has a great view on the bund bin winter the terrace is closed unfortunately
i liked the menu which is a mix of japanese and french the service was fast and very efficient and the staff spoke very good english
in conclusion it is s very reliable address, nothing beats the location of this restaurant it is in the premier location to see the lights of the ultra modern buildings shanghai pudong over the river from the bund probably one of the most magnificent sights in the world  when it comes to cityscape
the food was excellent too and the service top class you will not be disappointed  unless you choose a rainy day, i was taken here by a local business partner but was a little sceptical that the view of the bund would be awesome from the 4th floor well i was wrong absolutely amazing just had a couple of drinks so cant comment on the food but the service was great and i will definitely return to find out about the food cant get over the view, fish platter as snacks and pasta as main course were my combintions and i liked those very much the biggest advantages were those foods were not at all spicy, based on shanghai timeout recommendations we went there
the food was disappointing
sushi not fresh
the place was a bit messy and drafty
i dont recommend it, went to kathleens for a 60th birthday treat with friends this is the 3rd time i have been there and it confirmed my view that it is one of the best restaurants in shanghai the menu is extensive and the food tremendous the wine selction is great and you can get a good wine for the price the view is absolutely wonderful and you get a view from the huang pu bend
the manager dina made it very special for us and made a fuss for my birthday thanks to all at kathleens","bar",0.999824261073021
115,"i always go there for watching f1 racing  but also other sports events food is good and not to expensive and nice draft beers friendly staff a pool table where you participate if you want on different days offers like thursday 25  off the steaks, we had to visit this place since no other place was open i ordered 1 beer and they brought 4 glass of same beer  never mind i can finish my wife ordered 4 types of snacks then after 15 min when we still have still 3 beers and lots of snacks the waiter pushed us for the bill as they need to close this is not acceptable if they told us they are closing that early that night either we will try another place either we will not order that much it is not good to inform customer that you are closing just after you made your maidan hope the upper management will see this review as the local staff needs serious improvement , las posadas christmas party was the best  with delicious tamales and great music
i have always found pistolera very friendly atmosphere and didnt disappointed me even in that special occasion, went there with friends after sports service was average as it seems only some waiters can speak english but you can see they are trying i spilled part of my drink after getting grazed by a hot dish served at our table no harm done and i said nothing but the waiter took it upon himself to replace my drink for free nice, everything was perfect from the view to the service charming waitress in black attire tasty food good western music and swag if youre in shanghai and wants to feel like youre in new york this is the place kudos, lucky to not miss game 7 of the world series  just arrived to shanghai night before  found out about big bamboo directly behind our hotel during breakfast

since then weve dropped in for catching a piece of the action of nfl nba and nhl games throughout our stay with other enthusiastic sport fans here

happy travels yall, the perfect restaurant for all the sport lovers where is possible to watch several kind of event sport drink beer and a wide choice of food to enjoy of your favourite sport in the company of your friends, best sports bar in shanghai with good quality food service and prices every time i go to shanghai i enjoy having my meal  drinks here atmosphere is good and staff are friendly, as i live in changzhou mexican food is hard to come by and havent been able to leave there in quite some time today i had the chance to go to shanghai and chose to hit the big bamboo i hadnt been there in over a year a few things have changed most notably the prices they have gone up quite a bit

i ordered the chicken burritos there was only one big one instead of two smaller ones that they used to do refried beans and rice are no longer included either not a good bargain at about $15 my wife got the machos nachos they were good but close to $20 which was way too pricey my friend got the double bamboo burger it was good but now around $15

waitress was nice but didnt offer us refills or check on us

i doubt ill return as there are better places for all of the cuisines they offer at much more reasonable prices, title says it all been here a few times they had rugby golf olympics on tv but still managed to get the epl on forme in the side room service was a little slow but it is a busy place so understandably so had a hot beef sandwich with fried and gravy was as good as home very helpful staff and free wifi one of my favourite bars in shanghai thanks, over the last few years its fair to say ive been a regular here in my opinion its the most friendly bar you could visit in shanghai its great for expats ive made some good friends in here over the years
the staff are secondtonone its the best service ive ever experienced finally i should mention the burgersif nothing else come down for a burger theyre damn good and theyve just updated the menu with even more tasty choices, i certainly havent been to every burger joint in shanghai but big bamboo serves a real good one beer is cold and sports on tv wait staff is excellent and very friendly good enough with english visited twice on this trip and great both times in a good neighborhood plenty of taxis, ive lived in china many years ago and visit often and i love chinese food but sometimes after traveling around the less appealing parts of the country you just need a juicy burger ice cold draft beer and some old music videos playing on the screen the burgers are excellent i love the one with blue cheese but they have plenty of other great food the fajitas for example this place has been around forever and has stayed open while plenty of other places have closed they must be doing something right, big bamboo had some amazing food from pizzas nachos to burgers and steak a wide variety of beers including guinness on tap

they have a pool table which was always occupied till the wee of hours of the night

lance our server was fantastic spoke fluent english and was on the ball anticipating our next drink and knew the food well

we ended up visiting every night of our stay

the place has a great dj as well belting out retro numbers

overall a lively place which brought a sense of being alive

will definitely come back on our next visit, we are here wednesday lunch time we were served quickly and although busy found a table easily there is a pool table here and tvs the doors open fully at the front allowing for a breeze to come through
they offer free wifi which is easy to connect to
ours meals came to 245 yuan which included 4 beers and 2 meals
i had the pad thai which was lovely very spicy and my boyfriend the beef sandwich with beef gravy and chips which was lovely as the beef was marinated in rosemary both meals were delicious and arrived promptly
my fiance eats here regularly while in shanghai and it was he who recommended it and i have to say i would definitely recommend it to others, i love the nanyang rd big bamboo sports bar and am a regular customer in fact i am here now but standards are slipping so i hope mgmt will read this and make improvements
bb is a very good sports bar however today sat the sports being shown on tv are old and not much thought to what is being aired for instance now showing is game 1 of the cavspistons series but game 3 was just played today so they should be showing that game
the burgers taste is still good but picture on the menu shows a generous helping of fries in a nice steel cup i received about ten fries on the plate  not very appealing
the service team is as good as ever regarding expediting service so thats good
the website also does not work well as i tried to get on to view the sports schedules but many links do not work, i simply love this place good crowd good food we come here to watch live football match  love the selection of asian and western food they offer restaurant is always full and sadly some days its just hard to get seats they reserve tables which i feel is not a good thing
staff speak very basic english love the jalapenos in particular overall a good fun place to dine, this place has always been a draw for expats  locals alike
multiple sports screens pool tables good lighting good food nice background music that doesnt mean punters have to shout at each other smoking  non smoking area
a nice environment to have a few beers a winning combination
please open one in ningbo big bamboo you would make a killing, i stopped here for dinner and i spent really good time the steack was really delicious
goos service good seers, i havd a drink with my friends at this bar  very good place to relax  only one thing is when i pay the bill  the staff ask for tips , had a great time watching the nfl playoffs and drinking beers on tap the place is full of americans and any sports fan they have a nice pool table many screens with comfortable chairs at both tables and barstool spaces very friendly staff that kept the crowd pleased with many offerings this place will open for early am games 530am for the first wild card game also they will stay open if the game is on late

their food looked great very extensive menu but i did not eat great place and i will be back, stopped off here recently for a couple of drinks and to watch the f1

service was excellent and the atmosphere was great we ended up hanging around for a while had some nachos and more drinks

its not a fine dining place just a great friendly bar with very tasty food ideal for watching a game on one of the many large screen tvs, if you fancy a place to have a beer and a burger then it has to be the big bamboo its a great place to escape to a western style bar, i have visited this place several times over recent years and its good to see the standard is still high the atmosphere is fantastic and if you are travelling alone it wont be long before you are chatting drinking and playing pool with the lively regulars the standard of pool is high as many players are from the local league but the atmosphere is very friendly and service is excelleny, missing canada come here great selection on the menu for canadian type food even poutine friendly atmosphere and they are always showing a hockey game on the tvs and rugby of course easy to get to and reasonably priced, i like going to this spot to watch sports events but i must admit that having brunch here is probably not the best place to go to in shanghai good overall but just not brunch, if you are looking for western food and western company this is the place to go if you are missing home you will love there menu from full breakfast to burger and chips never been disappointed with the food, shows the premier league which is fantastic also the added bonus of time difference means the games show from around 7pm  10pm great before a night out food is too expensive and the same goes for drinks but i think that is the price you pay for a great sports bar, i am not a friend of sports bars but for good food and attentive service ill bear with tvs all over the place and an ambiance on the noisy side we went there arriving late after our flight had been <u+feff>delayed and i liked it enough to come back before my departure from shanghai the mexican food was authentic and very tasty guinness on tap is always a treat, i went here with friends place is nice and food is good one can enjoy sports on large screens and food for decent price, its one of the best places to go if you want to play pool and hangout food is good but a little expensive, this review is for the premises situated at 381 hongfeng road pudong

this is always a nice place to go with friendly and attentive staff ample seating and with pool tables and table football to while away an hour or so after dinner it is ideal for sports fans which i am not particularly as there are multiple screens permanently showing many different games

i have always found the food to be of good quality and on the two occasions our group dined there i had a huge hot dog marred a little by their toasting the inside of the bun but with this knowledge beforehand i am sure it is possible to request this is not done and on the other occasion everyone ate bar me because the waitress had forgotten to order mine otherwise i could have given a critique on the all day breakfast to be fair she was very apologetic but the thought of eating mine after everyone else had finished didnt appeal so i went without

if you intend to down quite a few drinks it is wise to go during the happy hours 18002000 i think

there is outdoor seating for those who prefer an alfresco setting, great food and ice cold drinks boys happy with their beers as us girls with the cold wine food great, pizza was google f1 enjoyable no sound unfortunately should change their branding to sports to watch 80s music for listening

i have never been to a pub that took so long to get a refill and i was sitting at the bar manager trying to look managerial cute bartender looking for new bf other bartender trying to pick up the slack for the other two job no 1  serve drinks job no 2  see job no 1, this is the place recommended particularly for foreignerswide range of alcoholic  non alcoholic drinks at reasonable pricesgood food and most important the feeling you are at your home pub restaurantservice was attentive and staff conversant in englishthere are a few big screen tvs where you can watch live sports eventsi ordered the laksa as my main course for dinner it was very delicious and tasted like that cooked in malaysia and singaporetaking a cab to this place is easy as most cab drivers are familiar with this pub restaurant, big bamboo is more or less a brand name for a couple of sports bars in shanghai in hongmei pedestrian road i visited many times the bb
recently getting very thirsty when shopping in jingan district i desired some pint of kilkenny and finally found my way to this  another  big bamboo sports bar
here i was not disappointed by the friendly waitress and got my cool beer almost as quickly as i drank it then a second definitely slower to drink
the place is very similar to the other two i know one in pudong from decoration menu and drinks and a very nice place to hang out after work, there are a number of locations but i prefer the one in jignan i love this place

it is friendly great service good food reasonable prices there are tvs everywhere you turn showing an assortment of sports from all over the world they are open crazy hours to catch important events live during world cup they were open all night and into the morning when big matches are bing shown the place is crowded and lively

the staff is top notch they are efficient and friendly there is a nice mix of regulars and tourists so you can strike up a conversation with likeminded sports fans from all over the world, i go to shanghai on extended business trips i like to go to the big bamboo behind the ritz carlton there are actually a few of these and they are the same chain it is a great place to go for stella beer and others i really dont like the chinese beer so this is good when i get the chance
if you want to pretend you are back home and in an american bar this is the place other than the chinese waitresses you would think you were home you dont have to be a sports fan to come here the food is good
dos and donts
do try the bamboo burger or the big bamboo burger this is as good as any home made burger you can have in the us
do try the spicy sicilian pizza if you want a spicy kick this is the one the other pizzas are good as well
do talk to mary upstairs she is a really nice lady and her english is top notch she will get you what you want and make great conversation the other servers all have adequate english for anything you order

they do have specials for every night of the week so check those out too

dont try the bar b cue ribs they are expensive vs what you get at home and a disappointment

otherwise all other food i have had there is good and priced right i can walk out with a tall glass of beer and pizza for well under $20 good prices in shanghai

tipping is not required in china dont feel bad at all not leaving a tip since this is an expat bar you may want to leave 10 but it is really not necessary, awesome little bar that we found in shanghai great if you are staying in the ritz carlton good selection of meals and drinks staff were great plenty of sports on the tvs im not a sports fan but good if youre feeling a little home sick , great food great drinks great atmosphere great fun great sports it was the best night we had while in shanghai keep up the good work, ate here twice on a recent business trip quick friendly service quite lively large tvs showing english and american sports food is a mix of american mexican bit of pasta and a bit of chinese i had a burger one night and a burrito on my next visit both were good not the best ever but what you would expect from this sort of place i guess good cocktail menu and it was perfect for a business dinner with friends where we didnt want to get dressed up after work etc relaxed atmosphere with good service something on the menu for everyone not somewhere you would go if you wanted to talk business but as a social place its perfect my only complaint would be the amount of smoke coming from the uk where smoking indoors is banned i find the smell particularly offensive especially while i am eating i left here stinking of smoke and had to shower and wash my hair before going to bed, proper irishenglish bar

free pool cheapish drinks good people and food good atmosphere and very friendly staff which is rare in china, saturday night english premier league live on the many large screen tvs busy place with a good atmosphere good menu was mostly pubbeer food burgers wings pizza nachos etc, this place is open late for diner midnight weekdays and 1 am on the weekends big bambo hongmei lu location is a nice place to run into expats and locals alike good crowd good food extended selection of beers while playing pool is a great way to spend the evening for non smokers  go to the second floor it has plenty of seating in the front courtyard as well but not for non smokers or the people who are allergic to smoke dont forget to try the jalapeno poppers for the ones who enjoy spicy food the dish is simply amazing, went here on a whim as i finished late one evening ordered a classic burger it was terrific the coffee was excellent too if you like your western food then this is the place for you not expensive the staff were friendly and efficient a real sports bar atmosphere woth lots of tvs showing different sports, visited a couple of times
food selection is worse than other similar places boxing cat shanghai brewery  but most annoying is the behaviour of employees
some were getting drunk joking about customers talking very loudly between themselves
this place has a huge potential but it is getting stuck in the foreigner ownership  chinese idontcare management style
guys find another place to hang out, after i arrived in china i was very worried about feeling comfortable with the food and places i go but big bamboo was a good surprise they have western style drinkscocktailsfoods and ambiance i had a great time while in shanghai and me and my friends left with a good impression of the place

i recommend you try the todiefor barbeque wings buffalo wings and perhaps the chin pa chicken or something like that good music as well as english speaking waitresses although you may need to explain things a couple of times

if you dont like smoking try the upper section and the terrace

shanghai is a beautiful place so enjoy, the pizza isnt made there they send out smoking is allowed in dinning areas neighborhood is set up for western travelers mostly western travelers in restaurantbar no live entertainment except pub quiz etc steaks mexican and pasta is good, good sports bar with nice beer and a mix western cuisine the bar is majorly occupied by the expats in shanghai and you hardly see the locals there try the grilled chicken spaghetti i like it quite a lot, was here in shanghai on business and needed to find a place to watch the gold medal game in sochi felt right at home at this bar good service beers and atmosphere for watching sports service is strong and i will most likely be back here in the summer to catch world cup","Indian cuisine",0.812741135774316
116,"rabbs eggs benedict with salmon were absolutely delicious nicely cooked and served service is rather chinese without saying more but mimosa very acidic sparkling wine not sure maybe even chinese and an orange juice from the can where it shall be a freshly squeezed one otherwise a vibrant place in a nice corner of xin tian di, kabb serves delicious steaks and other type of western food the restaurant is very popular and sometimes service suffers as a result of it be patient the waiters are very busy and its accepted to call one loudly in summer the outside is a great place to enjoy the food and do people watching, early 2000s i first visited xintiandi just as the area was starting the concept was to utilise some of the historic architectural designs of shanghai so creating a chic lifestyle and dining experience for a city that saw itself on the way up at that time i was not too impressed  not so much going on that would take me away from more familiar shanghai pubsbarsdiners since then xintiandi has matured into what i feel personally is a great place to visit for dining drinks experience and for me photography during my recent visit to shanghai i visited the area three times and each night going with my son to one bistro which quickly became our favourite kabb
this particular restaurantbar is located in a side alley within the beautiful northern section of xintiandi what immediately caught meimpressed me was the exterior of the building  a careful renovation of a twofloor grey brick structure typical of old shanghai as a photographer i just loved it  as i did with much of the surrounding area of course but kabb had a special beauty to it
going inside we were greeted by the agm stephanie ge who made us not only feel welcome on what had been a cold rainy shanghai day  but on talking with stephanie i discovered that kabb is part of the blue frog family  blue frog is a higherend burger restaurant group that has proved increasingly popular in china with its improved themes on burgers and other pasta salad and steak dishes kabb is more of a bistro venture for the group in keeping with the image of xintiandi some burgers are on its extensive menu but there is also a much greater range from the grill quality seafoods and appetisers they have an extensive good value lunch menu and weekend brunch
what impressed me and what took me back with my son was simply dining in such a beautiful location  i loved the ambience the feeling of walking up every evening from xintiandi metro station and taking in the whole atmosphere of xintiandi of walking through beautiful trafficfree alleys filled with history and then arriving at the little square in this side alley where kabb was located
there was always a warm welcome from the staff and eventually leaving kabb it was a pleasant feeling in such a vast modern city to step out into shanghais fascinating history
would i go back to kabb when in shanghai  yes i would certainly return next time i am in shanghai  which hopefully will be sooner than later it is only 5 hours away by train from beijing, we stumbled across this place on a cold and rainy november day attracted initially by their lunch deal the food was better than we had expected and we both enjoyed our meals the place has a great informal atmosphere and the staff couldnt do enough for us, i visited there by myself and my feeling and experience for this shop was not good as much i expected food was normal price was little expensive but normal in the new world area and the service was not good menu is just ordinary anyway i do not satisfied this shop at all <u+d63c><u+c790><u+bc29><u+bb38> <u+be44><u+cd94> <u+ac00><u+aca9><u+c740> <u+c2ec><u+cc9c><u+c9c0> <u+b300><u+be44> <u+c18c><u+c18c> <u+c11c><u+be44><u+c2a4> <u+bcc4><u+b85c> <u+ba54><u+b274><u+b3c4> <u+bcc4><u+b85c> <u+b9db><u+b3c4> <u+bcc4><u+b85c>
<u+ac04><u+d310><u+bcf4><u+ace0> <u+ae30><u+b300><u+b9c8><u+ad6c><u+ae30><u+b300><u+b294> <u+c544><u+b2c8><u+c9c0><u+b9cc><u+d588><u+b294><u+b370><u+b9db><u+bcf4><u+ace0><u+ba54><u+b274><u+bcf4><u+ace0> <u+ac00><u+aca9><u+bcf4><u+ace0> <u+bcc4><u+b85c>
<u+be44><u+cd94><u+c785><u+b2c8><u+b2e4>, nice grill resturant in xintiandi the hamburger is really good the service is not the best in town but this is quite normail in shanghai, stopped in for lunch nachos which is the kabb chefs special all corn chips lacking beef and cheese
chicken strips were 100 times better

good service

baby high chair was not safe baby tray tilts forward so food and plates fall of easy, came by for brunch after being away several years pancakes last time were great and were what i was looking for this time but they let me down overcooked stiff dumped some sliced bananas in syrup and called it banana pancakes disappointing, quite often i head to kabb in xintiandi for a beer or four after work the happy hour deal on beer is perfect for the end of the day  2 for 1 beer deal the food is not too bad without being great the outdoor area is nice in the warmer weather except that quite often there are tables of heavy smokers there to avoid the cigarette smoke you can head inside where smoking is strictly prohibited in the colder months indoors is the only option which is not a problem for me, went for breakfastbrunch and we were thoroughly impressed we were a party of 7 and we were worried it might be slow or poor service not the case the food arrived very quickly and the waiters were very attentive

everything was amazing the omelet  the frittata the burrito and the salmon benedict the bloody mary kit was a nice touch, we only had a drink here but it was happy hour so 2 henikens for 40 tea was more expensive that the beer all decked out for halloween service was very good and music too seems really popular and lots of people eating nice seating bar stools have backs on them and nice and cushioned too wish we had found it earlier, me and my boyfriend spent our first ever date here and it was so great lovely terrace great location and good drink deals also on another evening we experienced great food with friends i wish they had more branches in our district, my wife and i visited kabb to celebrate our wedding anniversary the ambiance was like a hipster barrestaurant  dark and the music was slightly loud not the ideal romantic setting we were seeking for this occasion it was a fun environment though

the food was great we split a caesar salad the black pepper tuna app and the fetachicken pesto pasta we loved the pasta and the tuna although the tuna looked slightly different from the menu the salad was good but typical

my only minor criticism is that the tuna quality was slightly high considering the quality and the amount

however the food was great and we will definitely return, title tells it all tried their seasonal menu  thaistyle chargrilled chicken salad chicken coconut chili absolutely fantastic combination the best salad ive ever eaten so far, kabb was a regular haunt when we lived here a few years ago so nostalgia pulled us back being in xintiandi this is expat central so prices reflect that  however kabb is always a great location to sit outside have a beer and people watch food was average hence the rating but kabb is more for an outdoor beer relaxing with friendsplenty of other places close by for eats, visited this restaurant a few days back with some of my colleagues the best thing was that the waiters talked in fluent english and for a person like me vegetarian helped quite a lot while selecting my dish the non alcoholic drinks were great too

will definitely recommend, from western to asian dishes they have it all despite the great location is famous xintiandi area the place is not that cheap service however is quite good and our waitress was actually very sweet, an office colleague recommended kabb and we both went over for lunch

the restaurant is in xintiandi and therefore easy to get to since we went a bit late on a weekday the restaurant wasnt that crowded

we both went in for the cheese burgers

thankfully mine came as ordered well done the burger was decent and the fries were not that great

may head there again for a quick bite, went there for a late dinner with a group of five people with reservation

positive the restaurants atmosphere itself was great the menu list music decoration were well balanced with each other it is also located in the middle of xintiandi tourist spot it wasnt easy to quickly grab a taxi since the waiting line was very long even at night unless you have on your own phone app to call a cab the food that we ordered were delicious i ordered one of kabbs recommendation spicy seafood spaghetti and i have to give it a thumbs up

downside the most obvious experience throughout the dining time was the service of the waitress not smile no gesture or passion shown in her attitude she was not attentive to us even when we asked for five glasses of water more than 3 times no apology but gave an annoying face back to us the restaurant didnt look that full and busy when we arrive so there shouldnt have been an excuse for a basic request from guests she was in charge of

if the service part improve i might come back, if you like light western food and salads this is the place good food beatiful building reasonable service, a nice selection of western type food the prices are more on the higher side especially for the steaks it can get pretty crowded so eat early of grab a beer while you wait for your table service is good and the steak that i had bacon wrapped filet was tender and juicy happy hour takes place so get in on it to cut down on the price of a glass of wine or beer, i like the atmosphere in this bistro and menu is varied and never fails to deliver however if only the staff could manage to deliver the food on the right order despite being asked i would rate it much higher, it has been almost 1 year that i did not come to shanghai since i move i used to come regularly to kabb and it is one of the oldest shop in xintiandi their food was again very good  nothing makes you blown away but very good decent and the cocktails are also nice and fairly priced for xintiandi, visited mar 28 2016 and ordered appetizers with drinks we were seated at the outdoor area near the cashier the drinks are okay nothing memorable the cookie that accompanied our mocha was good we cant comment on food because the waitress did not input our food orders even though she repeated the exact words of what we ordered when taking them down they also billed us as soon as all our drinks were placed on the table we paid anyway we waited a long time for our food that never came obviously and mentioned this to the cashier who wasnt happy when we pointed out their poor service we get this a lot from cheap street food stalls but to experience such bad attitude in one of the cafe in xtd was a big disappointment before we finished our drinks we noticed the waitress who took our order was already changed out of her uniform and finished her shift perhaps the reason she left out our food orders completely, this is a very international restaurantbar which i have gone to many times before over the past 810 years this time we went with a very international group and everybody was happy they have a great happy hour make sure what is on the happy hour list not all drinks are but the once that are are good value for money their snack plates are very good and a great start before the main meal, nice place to enjoy a beer and a steak great atmosphere and people great drinks and appetizers service is ok, it is very rare to have a restaurant fro 10 years maintaining the same good quality of food in shanghai well the kabb is one of them
i used to eat very often at this place almost 10 years ago dined last night at kabb yes same good quality food menu has changed of course but still fresh tasty dishes the servants pleasant smiling and very accommodating as usual this restaurant has a great outdoors sitting in xintiandi in the middle of a mixed crowd it was though chilling last night in shanghai
if you are in town i recommend seeing xintiandi ad lunching or dining at kabb salads are very good so is their kabb burger, found this place by accident happy hour runs from 58 pm its buy one get one on draft beers and house wines guinness beer is excluded from happy hour

ordered a double on the appetizer i was hungry it was really too much only complaint was the the staff served tartar sauce instead of blue cheese with the wings and wanted to charge extra for the blue cheese

recommend this place if youre looking for western food good drinksand a lively atmosphere come early or youll have to sit at the bar, living in shanghai 2 years kabb is my local standby and after dozens of visits it is very consistent friendly staff efficient service good drinks and very tasty food not too quiet lively enough to enjoy but good for a business meal too different lunch dinner and weekend brunch menus salads appetizers entrees not a burger or pub food place really good pasta with pesto tuna steak grilled steaks and the bloody mary kit is inspired mix your own as you like it cheese and deli appetizer is unusual desserts are the least interesting part reasonable prices at least for western food in shanghai 3 similar locations, we were 4 layout was good with just enough separation to be able to talk business the staff are friendly but the order came out gradually rather than together the food was tasty sesame shrimp was nicely cooked and juicy a nice looking version of scotch broth and mains of seafood pasta  thai warm duck salad lamb burger and baked norwegian salmon with a round of drinks to start and a bottle of average aussie wine 2k rmb so not cheap but nothing is cheap in shanghai worth a visit, ok so going to kabbs you need to get the bloody mary kit it is an awesome way to have a drinking brunch there and the food is good as well protip get the whole bottle of vodka itll be cheaper if you are a group but that is where it stops because the staff is awfully inattentive

it is unfortunate because it is the run of the mill for xintiandi really but the staff will pay you absolutely no attention want a drink pfft wait for an hour want to get your food order in pfft try and flag one of them down and they will see you in 30min i ended up getting up and going directly to the bar each and every time we wanted a drink because the outside staff would not helpful when they saw me doing this they laughed and enjoyed it but never offered to help

go to kabbs and enjoy the people watching while sitting outside expect to be there for 34hrs just waiting to get all of your drinks and food and no i am not being facetious, if you are want to meet people from all over the world then this is the spot to go expatriates from around the globe that now live in shanghai are mingling here amazing service in a beautifully restored old building, they have a reasonable pub platter or two and some pub grub that is not quite in line with some decent pubs from the west but if you are missing this then this will suffice reasonably priced for xintiandi as well

decent draught beer, if you are in xintiandi and looking for western food with a wide variety of options this is a good place cocktails are ok and food is normally constantly good we have been here quite a few times as it is the best place for cheesy chips and that is what i miss from home cheesy garlic chips the steaks are only ok and you have to really check that they understand how you want it it is not that they are often over or under done but they are likly to differ somewhat from what you ask for pasta tends to be good and sesame prawns are a favorate the portions are generous and given that xintiandi is a very expensive area the prices are ok, tried to eat here twice recently first time the order was forgotten second time in drink turned up 10 mins after inedible food there was is so many other good places in xintiandi dont bother with these complacent, went here for dinner the other night good quality food and ambience sitting outside we had steak and lamb chops which were delicious truffle mashed potato to die for they have happy hour till pretty late so buy one get one free house wine and beer i would definitely go back, been there a couple of times and will go back and apparenlty im not the only one thing so as the terrace seems to be full all the time excellent location in the heart of xintiandi surrounded by beatiful old buildings excellent salads nachos and other snack type foods beefprobably will not even try there, had a quick business lunch there and really liked the place good western food and top service salads and meats were excellent located in an awesome place need to get back to have lunch or dinner with more time, been here a couple of times for lunch dinner and after dinner drinks food not bad and drinks okay but a bit pricey relatively cheaper options available in shanghai, i visited this place couple of times we never have had any problems regarding food and service best part is sitting outside these days and watch the xintiandi crowd a comfortable and casual option at xintiandi, kabb has provided an excellent venue for so many years in xintiandi cocktails are top draw  the menu contains superb variations on standard fare the only thing stopping me giving a five star review is its success every night of the week its full to bursting with customers  its difficult to squeeze in, we were looking for a place to eat monday night and were having a hard time at one place nearby they told us the kitchen was closed after we ordered drinks and decided what we wanted from their menu at another estado puro they wanted to give us small rations for and outrageous price and another was sort of a german place we were not in the mood for sausages so we kept on looking and found kabb

the place was quiet because of the day the time and because it is on a sort of side street of the french concession the staff welcomed us with open arms and were very kind to us we ordered a couple of dishes they gave us the code for internet if you dont have a chinese number to connect free wifi means nothing in many places in china and they gave us theirs to use and asked us nicely if we would want to order anything else probably because they were going to close the kitchen but at least they asked us unlike the other place i had a duck salad excellent and my friend had a lasagna which was also very good not the finest of the finest cuisine but they fed us

decoration is modern but cosy without being kitsch prices are a bit high but that is what you pay in the area music is buddha barhotel costes type loved it but as i said in the title no drama and no pretentiousness at this place would recommend without doubt oh and as we were finishing our meal a couple came in also foreigners and they were not sent away great policy great service , remains a good restaurant in the area was there on thursday and had the steak special good size steak with side orders salad and a glass of wine for 198rmb good value for xtd area staff are always very good with great level of training always worth a visit if you can get a table , xintiandi is a nice but expensive place to dine in shanghai location is really nice staff were really friendly but food was just solala the steak was not really medium
but rather almost done but the staff were friendly and gave me some extra dessert for compensation id probably still go back there because the location is really great lets see how the food will be the next time, had dinner there with a colleague good food good meat excellent service the waitress was very caring and pro i will return when i have a chance, found this restaurant by chance after two weeks of chinese food it was great to have some very good western food staff spoke good english and were very helpful good choice and variety of food on menu happy hour was well worth it too we recommended kabb to some other british tourists who were also impressed would definitely come again, we had lunch after a morning of touring this is a great place for a western style
meali had a ribeye that was world class service was quick and responsive
and manager spoke good englisha great help go, i went there with a friend as per her recommendation it was good western style cooking the duck salad we tried was nice as well as their appetizer platter
we also had some pasta with truffle and enjoyed some wines along our meal
good value for money and portions are big
my only downturn is that we had to call the service every time we needed something which made our experience ok and not great, i have been going to kabb now for the better part of a decade the quality of the food there has remained constant what has changed is the service whoever is in charge of training kabb staff should get a medal they are friendly efficient and knowledgeable attributes unimaginable in shanghai a decade ago

go there and order the rueben on rye you wont regret it, best western brunch in shanghai great food and service cocktails are gorgeous ideal way to spend a sunday afternoon ","Sichuan cuisine",0.796482598374068
117,"nice and cosy is franck tucked away in a small street the service is good the food very tasty and the restaurant nicely decorated and lit definite a place to return too, french bistrot with delicious soup and starters including oyster tasty meat dishes my favourite is steak tartare very large french wine menu, started with an aperitif and finished with a bottle of sauternes the daily specials and main menu were priced well for the quality most people will need the sommeliers help with the astute wine list of excellent quality but watch your budget $$$ it is easy to get carried away by the ambiance and great company, it is a treat to come to this place food is always delicious french style a la carte and service is personal and excellent be prepared it might not come inexpensively though�, francks is quite simply the best food weve had in the city the prices are a bit steep but with such excellent food and service it cant be beat my husband and i usually wind up both ordering the steak each time we visit because it is of superb quality and always cooked exactly how we ordered it this is definitely a place that cant be missed if you are visiting or live in shanghai, went back to this restaurant again which is situated in the french quarter last night and wasnt let down
it has a limited menu but the food was excellent and if you like a good steak then this is a good place to eat
due to the weather cooling down lately we ate inside which was very nice, lovely warm cosy restaurant on a chilly shanghai evening
stews and steak and very delicious oysters were consumed
the chips are excellent, when i told my colleague that i am taking them to a restaurant to experience old shanghai they had no idea that they would be having french cuisine at this little bistrot in the courtyard of wukang road  famous for its authentic romantic atmosphere in the french concession area that houses all the shanghai society people in the 1930s and 1940s shanghai is as colonial as it is chinese the patio is great and the area is quint the food is very nice i had the sea bass which is obvious not chilean which i prefer as those are more fatty but very well cuisine
i totally come to any of the ferguson lane restaurants again to experience this side of shanghai by the way all the staff at the restaurants are the most professional weve seen in china everyone even speak french my colleauges and i were having really good french food in an authentic french restaurant that represent the essence of shanghai great experience, ferguson lane where franck is located is a beautiful little enclave isolated within the heart of shanghais french concession which is itself the heart of shanghai on a cool fall or warm spring day there are few better patios to sit on than francks

add in some excellent service from friendly attentive and knowledgeable staff and at the very least franck would be an excellent place for a glass of wine and a few small dishes

the food i had last night was good  some dishes were delicious seafood casserole cote de porc while others left me disappointed lobster bisque sea bream the costs are high here but you do get the sense that the quality is high and in some cases like the dishes mentioned above worth it

the long story short is that franck is an excellent place to visit if youre looking for fine french food in a very jovial atmosphere with outdoor seating, lets start from the price in 4 people we ordered several dishes and we shared all of them so we could try different kind of food
good quality good presentation i particularly liked the snails

service to be improved
a we asked for oil and vinegar for our salad they brought it but then they took it away they needed it for a different table for that price i expect they can have one set for each table
b we ordered a good wine at an acceptable price we wanted the order a second bottle but they had only one bottle, as usual everything was great attentive service with nice discussion with the team freshness of the food and as usual amazing wine list, the food are normal but not outstanding for the price  the wine are creasy expensive  the bigger problem dont eat the bread in the restaurant because they recycle it   i saw one employe so it , great service great food great location and great prices for their free flow rose whats not to love they also have the best french fries ive had in shanghai definitely give it a try, nice classic french food but service isnt consistant i used to go there more often to satisfy my cravings for french food because franck was the only place that served classic bistro style cuisine in shanghai consistently good food with inconsistent service  cliches come true, franck has always been a real winner in terms of french restaurants in shanghai i think the wines are too expensive but if you are going for the food its good value for money i am never disappointed there the bread is some of the best in china which is why he opened farine always have good butter and fleur du sel on the table the tartare is good and the fried potatoes that come with them are some of the best in shanghai the terrine de compagne is also great i never had a bad meal there, if you have been travelling china for a while and feel like a change from the lovely noodles dumplings rice stir fry dishes skewers of meat and seafood hotpots etc etc then franck offers a great option

while obviously pricier then eating the local asian fare you can still have a reasonably priced by western standards meal in a classic bistro setting the fixed priced menu in particular offers a value for money option with a good selection of entree mains and desserts the selection of cold meats and beetroot salads were both tasty and the pork belly main was great

they have an extensive wine list some with an extensive price tag too however we went for some cocktails the gin cooler was a standout  delicious, if i hadnt been told about this restaurant i would never have found it it is situated off road on what looks like someones garden you need to follow the path around the corner to find this delightful restaurant we sat outside where the views are very nice you will need to book the food we had was very good but a tad pricy but the overall experience well worth it and i will be back when i visit shanghai next, the restaurant is on a street full of historical buildings built in the early 20th centuries rumor has that a certain retired party secretary resides here in one of the garden residences behind high walls if you are not in a hurry a 15minute leisurely stroll in the neighborhood will be a good start the bistro is medium sized warmly lit and has dark wood and leather decor no printed menu and all items were listed on a chalkboard in french our young male chinese waiter was more than courteous and explained all the choices patiently to start we had beet salad roasted fois gras and a bottle of australian syrah for main dishes we had alsatian pot roast with sauerkraut and a white fish stew with three kinds of fish served in a le creuset casserole both tasted delicious for dessert we picked profiteroles with strawberry to share it was light and satisfying
overall the restaurant serves fresh quality food in a quiet romantic setting with great service it is certainly not cheap but is not out of line compared with other restaurants in upscale neighborhoods in a major metropolitan city definitely recommending it, quiet sophisticated ambience at this pricey french restaurant except it didnt knock my taste buds away food was okay if it was half the price, a tad expensive but very consistent very good food and service i have been there at least 20 times and never disappointed, franck is a bit of an institution but the french food is average which is a real pity the service is a bit lay back and lacks the correct details to make it feel like a good brasserie or typical french restaurant it sounds a bit like these provincial second tier city restaurant in france it is not bad either but there is a huge margin for improvement since it is not a cheap eatery, i wish i lived in shanghai so i could eat here every saturday night excellent food wine and especially english speaking service, for me one of the best french restaurants in shanghai soft lighting that just make you glimpse your partner but all very intimate and private the food delicious and also wines i recommend it to all couples who want to enjoy an evening of love and good food the corner where the restaurant is also very impressive are springing up all around the galleries of contemporary art and sculptures an plan air
w la france, the service and food are excellent 
very nice place for a romantic dinner or business lunch
true french cuisine with a piece of france in the center of shanghai, located in the hip french concession this place is a delight to visit for dinner

it is a quiet candle lit place with good service and good food

there are no printed menus just boards that they put in front of your table so you can choose if you read french everything is in french the waitress was patient and explained everything we asked about

at the end we had a great meal, went there with my parents for brunch what can i say the food was brilliant staff competent location great go try it out besides french quarters is a nice area to wander around after a delicious meal, it�s extremely hard to find a reliable place for an extra special occasion in this city many of the bund fine dining establishments disappoint one way or another � i�ve heard of horrific service stories at mercato for example so when my wife asked me to choose somewhere for my birthday dinner franck was top of my list sure it doesn�t have spectacular bund views but the level of attention to detail for both the service and the food is second to none don�t ever doubt that they have forgotten anything � they take their time and this is what you should do if you dine here don�t scream for a menu for example as soon as you sit down � they will bring the two hand written boards over to you when the time is right

menus are only in french which isn�t a big issue for me being educated in england but the waiter will explain the dishes in english or chinese if needed the options are simple and limited but that�s how you know that what you order will be fresh and cooked properly

we had escargots 110 rmb and terrine de foie gras with caramelized onions 210 rmb to start and a simple filet de boeuf 280 rmb and duck breast 250 rmb for mains and everything was executed perfectly i tend to prefer english mustard with my steak but this is the one place i won�t rock the boat and will just go with the french mustard profiteroles provided the perfect ending to the meal although we had to share it because we were so full from the earlier courses i�ve had variants of profiteroles in a few other places but here what you get is the traditional version which is the version i tend to favour

in terms of decor it really does feel like you�ve stepped out of shanghai and straight in to a parisian bistro � lots of leather upholstery and dark wood panels wine options include not just bottles and glasses but also carafes perfect for the expectant couple where only one person can drink a full allocation of wine

prices aren�t cheap but it�s fair given the quality of the materials and the cooking so dinner for two came to 1400 rmb and i would pay that gladly at franck rather than take a chance at any of the bund joints, we had dinner  the waiting staff brought the black boards  came back but no explanations whatsoever and we had to call to place the order
the bread and butter excellent  the kir white wine aperitif was very average in taste and measure  they did not tell us which wine wine they use 
we picked the palourdes  in french it is a very high quality clam  they served some large local clams  a lot of flesh inside and a delicious sauce but it was not palourdes  the white asparagus are local  ok  they looked nice but totally tasteless  half cooked  no salt and cooked in water not in a nice stock with condiments

main courses 
duck breast  again no salt  the meat texture was great and the sauce very good 
the sole fish  it was not a sole  or perhaps what they call sole fish in asia but not what you expect in a french restaurant  the onions were very good and the sauce as well

desserts
profiteroles  nice portion and warm chocolate sauce poured on top by the waitress  but the vanilla ice cream was terrible  very low quality
creme brulee  nice sugar crust  cooked well but not rich and creamy like a real creme brulee because it is made with half milk half cream 

using local ingredients is fine but do not cheat the customers with wrong food names especially with these prices  this is classic french cuisine  basic things like white asparagus should be executed properly expensive or not 

the service was very average  we bought a bottle of wine and they served us once  i poured the wine my self three times  this is a bistro i know but the bill was 1500 fmb for two persons

it has changed since my last visit which was a great meal  my feeling is that there is a serious food cost reduction  milk in creme brulee  sole fish and palourdes which are not  which affects the culinary experience you have to make profit of course 
this is the kind of restaurant where people who do not know about french food are beeing cheated and think it is great because it is franck 

conclusion  overpriced for what is served  ambiance  atmosphere pleasant , we had great fresh food and nice wines the steak tartare was delicious so was the terrine de foie gras and the creme brulee pricewise it is at the higher end but then you get what you pay for, my wife and i had a perfect date night here last week the location is very old school shanghai a gem of a courtyard with several different shops and cafes francks food was exactly what you want  simple delicious reminds us of all of those little french places in the upper east side of manhattan where we are from currently expats in shanghai will be back often, i was thankfully invited to for dinner to franck
good menu on a black ardoise as a french bistrot would do we had cote de boeuf  900 rmb was good but seriously 120 eur for a piece of meat
wine is as well overpriced for the most simple one
other options await you around shanghai at a more affordable price , we went for dinner to franck in the weekend and had great food in a very nice environment the restaurant was full lots of happy people enjoying great food in a relaxed environment the food was great and so were the wines perfect was the cheeseplatter for desert the blue cheese and the goat cheese were to my taste the perfect temperature this doesnt happen often the desserts yes we wanted to try these too were fantastic too the mascarpone with fresh strawberries between to thin waffels was divine and the moelleux au chocolat as well close to perfection
if you like to have a night out with great food in a nice but relaxed athmosphere you should consider franck enjoy, my child is 6 months old and she has already been lucky enough to go to some great restaurants in a several countries we have found that truly good restaurants in eg london shanghai and elsewhere have been not just accommodating but actually welcomingbut we werent allowed to make a reservation at franck and the phone manner of the lady who took the call was brusque rather than apologetic they also didnt have any information the ban on babies on the website amateurs im afraid, title says all actually classic french cuisine limited menu card which i think is very good  menu in french but dont try ordering in french cause it stops at the menu not cheap but good, we visited franck while on holiday in shanghai with friends we had an amazing meal with yummy wine and gorgeous dessert

cannot wait to return, it was a new year and i m on holiday with mt gf we are looking forwards to eat the famous cote de bourf i wa stold by the chinese waitress that the cote de
bourf is about 800g and she recommended us to order 2 appetizers so i did everything went well till the main arrived i was served with fillet of beef instaed to cote de bourf we both was stunned as we both acknowledge that we had ordered cote de bourf  so i had spoke to the same chinese waitress and she said that we had ordered fillet of beef and not the cote de bourf we are angry and even worst we were told by her that if we are not full we can order something else as if we are wrong  however we are sure that we r correct but we are forced to eat what we did nt order  eventually the french manager  simon come to cool down the situation  but it din not help as i am very angry as this did nit show customer the respect  for me even the cheapest xlb restaurant in shanghai give customer respect than this place trust me even thia place is the best in the world i will never return again  bye franck  u guys better teach yr staft well before open a restaurant  ps i will hv gove zero star in trip adviser if i could, recommended on numerous websites it is just exactly what we love to discover in the french concession is a lovely detour where several restaurants and a gallery is situated quiet and intimate it serves basic bistro food done well the steaks are expensive but done well all the usual suspects you expect however the drink menu is dismal and all they serve is wine when i asked for a french 75 it was like staring at the great wall when i asked for cream for my coffee i was told that they do not have cream in the restaurant really a french restaurant without cream is it coffee mate in my mussels perhaps it was just lost in translation but it can certainly be better in an international city like shanghai have a better cocktail list and yes cream with coffee is a good thing i would still go back simple well made food excellent and not the zoo that one expects from mr and mrs bund, ive been a fan of franck for years and my appreciation is rewarded on every visit ferguson lane is a hopping area these days and franck pretty much put it on the map its a great part of town with lots of restaurants and bars in the area either in ferguson lane or in the neighborhood, the food is very good there are not so many options but all the ones i tried were very good the staff is also friendly and the place is very nice the wines are a little expensive, franck has become one of my favs something as simple as fresh mushroom salad looked very humble but was very tasty i have a weak spot for their foie gras terrine as well as the mussels available from time to time worth a visit, my favorite french place in shanghai great food great service nice wine selection highly recommend it, the place is packed so that says something well the first thing it says is that people found the place  it has the worst sign posting in the world start at the front on wukang and try to find your way to the back its easier once youve been there but we were at the point of giving up
once in the food is excellent  we had a steak and the shoulder of lamb  just to try different meat dishes both excellent the wine is super expensive and better not to think about too long the service is quick but slightly crazy  why bring a pot which stands on the table wondering how youre going to dish up why bring the steak without the sidedishes and wait around for those its all a matter of timing  the pot has to arrive with the utensils for dishing up or really the pot being there is useless, great french brasserie in a cool part of the french quarter part of the ferguson lane cluster of restaurants and bars franck offers a blackboard menu of fresh ingredients beautifully cooked typically french fare cooked well with an excellent wine list and good choice by the glass a nice secluded outdoor seating area if u want to dine alfresco inside is all french tiles and wood white table cloths and speedy service great option in old france, was there in june had an excellent dinner with a friend the ambience is cosy and the service outstanding i will definitely go again when im in shanghai again, we had diner several times at franck and the food is amazing
the meat is particularly exceptional
everything is qualitative from elaborate menus to bread or small details as sea salt

just a shame to have no sparkling wine by the glass at an affordable price

very professional staff

will go there again for sure , we had dinner here a couple of weeks ago and dinner was excellent i was pleasantly surprised by this place as im not a big french bistro fan the first thing i noticed was the best olive oil from nice on every table and the bread was cut from a country loaf with thick crust delicious the white asparagus was perfectly prepared and it looked as if the tbone steak was very good although i dont eat beef desserts were good but i cant even remember what we had i will go again, a little establishment located within the french concession area  a little walk from the main road if coming by taxi or other ground transport
the atmosphere is cosy and slightly lively but not overly as you normally would find in a shanghai eating establishments the food and wine selection is good so will cater well for a group with different taste buds but do skip the desserts nothing that excites the palate the portion can be shared if ordering multiple dishes small to average apetities
definitely pricey and there is no views, what i can i say  i love food i love ambiance  i love service  was really nice  thank for the great evening  expensive but really fun and nice atmosphere, im used to come here time to time when im in shanghai and the touch is always the same very good excellent wine selection and good food especially beef recommended, food service setting all quite nice but for 1600 rmb 2 persons starters bottle of the cheapest  and averagetasting  white mains digestifs i expect more than that","Japanese cuisine",0.999725803346049
12,"i recently stayed at the jingan shangrila in shanghai separate review and wanted to be sure to include a special review for the mixology skills of the bartenders at 1515 bar located on the hotels fourth floor in years past a trip to shanghai was not complete without a visit to the legendary el cocotel bar for their magnificent vesper martini sadly el cocotel has now closed but a new vesper champion has arisen at 1515 tracy li is a maestro in making this martini made famous in flemings casino royale james bond novel with stunning consistency the setting is relaxed and elegant not as deliciously seedy as el cocotel if you are a fan of this drink please look her up, situated in the shangri la shanghai this is a top class restaurant as you would expect not cheap but the food is top quality and cooked to perfection some of the best beef in the world and selection of daily fresh oysters that were top shelf oh and did i mention the panfried foie gras amazing, i had the saddest lobster bisque here it didnt even have lobster in it just one previously frozen little shrimp way over priced nice atmosphere  would be way better if the bar wasnt smoke filled but do not go for the food, i was excited to try this place out with three friends who had done their research on steak houses the first thing i appreciated was the entrance which was very striking but there was no view from our table and after the initial okay this is nice there wasnt much else to say we tucked into our menus and after trying to figure it out for several minutes i finally looked up to see if everyone was as puzzled as i was the menu is so clever that requires figuring out exactly how youre supposed to read it titles such as first act and supporting cast for items that are not steak but are entrees what there was a constant swirl of people checking on our table which was interesting considering my drink took 20 minutes to arrive and out meals took so long that we were late for our after dinner plans everyone else at my table was served and it got both embarrassing and annoying to keep asking about the status of my cocktail in fairness i did receive an apology and i was not charged for it our order of water though made up for this freebie we were asked if we wanted water and were charged for a bottle of i dont know what only to learn that they give free filtered water if you just ask for it that seemed rather cheap and i know others commented on this as well in their reviews now for the food shanghai has no end of restaurants that serve steak and having lived here for almost four years i have tasted some fine ones granted they dont come cheap but thats life here at 1515 you are charged a premium price for an ok steak and i mean a very ok steak for the price i had to laugh when my steak arrived on a very large white plate almost a mini platter with just the steak with a small dollop of garlic puree on the side the steak looked lonely does it really break the bank to add some vegetables or at the very least a piece of parsley presentation was a c
steak was a b because i had to saw through the meat rather than cut through it maybe people like to feel impressed that they can dine at 1515 maybe getting to say youve been there carries some clout i have no idea i felt overcharged and underservedwe couldnt get a second piece of bread to save our lives and the meals took forever on a less than busy night there are literally hundreds of other places you can turn to for the same price where you can get a view excellent food and great service, it is a very good restaurant for meat not fancy but still pricey and at the shangrila good ambiance nice wine list the quality of the meat is really good, some friend invite me for a drink at the 1515 west bar and it was the best surprise so far in shanghai since i arrive 6 years ago
gorgeous design  live musicians and singers 
and of course amazing drinks 
the talented macarena rotgers sent me to a place far away from shanghai with her creative range of cocktails 
beautiful well balanced  just delicious 
a must try if you live or stop by shanghai , this a great place to dine and drink with friends cosy and sleek a great selection of fine wine the place to go for a quiet evening out with friends, the atmosphere is exactly what i am looking for in a place to unwind after a stressful day working in this crazy urban jungle sights smells sounds all come together for a relaxing place to catch up with friends and have a few extremely reasonably priced cocktails

also the manager macarena is exceptionally welcoming the second time i was back she remembered my name what i was drinking and we chatted at length for a bit about all that is going on with me her life etc now that im a semiregular weve established a solid rapport and she consistently exceeds not only my expectorations by my friends and other patrons as well

the wine list is also quite wellbuilt one of the somms gerard has a great wealth of knowledge about whats going on not only on his wine list but on global wine trends hes quite a sharp thinker

then there is the food gosh worth every jiao the meat is always done to perfection i have never had a bad meal also btw they have free beef sliders at happy hour i mean can you get any better

anyway im on my way there now do yourself a favor get out to 1515 and treat yourself to 5star quality everything good job team, 1515 makes you feel at home as soon as the lift doors open macarena and her team serve super drinks and have a great happy hour my new favourite local, i was was taken to this restaurant by local friend but both us were disappointed  the server recommendations were only the top price items we ordered a medium steak and we were expecting a very fresh medium steak instead we got a overcooked burnt surface chewy steak we just ordered house water which is free in most restaurants in shanghai but we got a voss water in addition to that we were charged service fee all in a very disappointed service for such price level, this place is absolutely delightful the first time i stepped in 1515 this past december there was a frank sinatra  esk singer accompanied by a beautiful pianist and cozy fire ive been back several times since and always feel very at home the staff is incredibly welcoming and kind the drinks are solid my friend and i believe they have the best dirty martinis  steak in town upscale classy welcoming cozy incredible food and drink you cant go wrong 5 stars plus will continue to frequent, if there is a restaurant where you can absolutely ask the chef to surprise me this is one of them the 5 course meal was flawless with one beautiful and perfect dish after another and the final desert was perfect

if you are in shanghai this is one restaruant you certainly do not want to miss check their own cattle farm bred beef and cured meats in the window at the entrance, i came here with my colleagues and a few clients for what we thought would be a fivestar business luncheon the only thing fivestart about it is the price tag a two course lunch is rmb158++ im not sure what were paying for as it wasnt the speedy service

our lunch reservation was for after 1pm which meant that the dining area was pretty much empty with many customers already asking for their checks while we were placing our orders i guess the kitchen staff goes on break then too as apparently it takes 30 minutes to make a cold salad

aside from the wait times the dishes presented were on the small side

definitely wont be back unless they revamp their lunch menu to include more bigger options and better prices for rmb158++ you can do much better in this city with quicker service to boot, the bar is the most unbelievable place i have been the restaurant is just a plus to the beautiful bar the lounge manager is the best i have ever experienced, terrible service  pity because the food look good  but need to wait 1 hour to get my steak 
what happen , i went to this restaurant on my birthday and got an amazing beef and a extremely good chocolate cake for dessert, we decided to try the 1515 west chophouse  bar and what an incredible decision we made

the food and service was brilliant we especially enjoyed the squid ink gnocchi which we would highly recommend the restaurant is expensive but it is an experience you will not forget

do not miss the 1515 west chophouse  bar, last night in 1515 we had the most magnificent food  cooked by a guy who really cares he has a degree in molecular gastronomy and is encyclopedic in his know ledge of food the worlds best cheesecake and baked alaska this place serves more than meat fabulous black cod nobel prize winning lobster bisque and a wine list to match peerless cooking go this is a 6 star experience , open kitchen with fancy deco
suitable for biz dinner and for taking your partner out for a treat yes it is a steakhouse but as i love seafood so the chef himself tailor made some seafood dishes for me he is so creative the cod fish with coconut source was the highlight, in my opinion no had the 450 g ribeye baked potato onions and a glass of wine and bottle of still water paid over 1000 rmb
service was good and the steak was tender the baked potato was also good could have used some additional sour cream however the onions they were burned and they start to taste bitter when burned that spoiled my dinner in a restaurant with prices like that onions like these should not even leave the kitchen no i didnt want to argue i was tired and wanted to leave the next day i found a different choice for steak which personally suits me more
overall i do not need to return, i have been going to this place since it opened it is by far the best steakhouse in shanghai great food great whiskey and great service, steak house is about the steak if you love it then its great if not well you meat lovers know this one is good and all about the meat australia be proud i really enjoyed this place good wine list tignanello was fairly priced you know i highly recommend it for a great meal and enjoyable time, after so many stays at shangri la i finally tried 1515 i did not book and went to the restaurant firstly i was told to wait 10 minutes to get the table cleaned after they told me no tables and i could have dinner at the bar which i did staff at the bar was lovely but please remember the whole bar is a smoking mecca lets go to the food i ordered octopus a la plancha as a starter and the smallest tenderloin as meat with sauteed mushrooms as a side octopus was really nice and tender almost too much if that is possible i have anyway my doubts on the sauces mixed on the plate mainly a sort of minestrone one which i found quite wired beef was cooked to perfection which is already a great plus i just found it slightly salty but this is me not adding salt anywhere  even on the salad mushrooms were ok but not to die for i will for sure go back and booking in advance to have a seat at the restaurant, i allways thought best steaks are in usa but i was wrong if you wan to have good steaks this is your choice absolutely restaurant is nice and service is good only minus goes to prices steaks arent cheap but worth trying anyhow, this has become my regular cocktail bar in shanghai this year great atmosphere slow jazz gorgeous decor and of course fantastic cocktails great place to spend an evening with friends i love it every time, ok nothing for low budget travellers but for me and my wife this place is simply the best for steaks in shanghai
so we invited some friend here for an nice evening sharing a big chunk of meat
the long aged steak was prepared perfectly to the point we three were full from one portion and thankful to the waitress recommending us not to order much more since it will be more than enough side dishes were very nice but not our main interest
at the end a perfect evening, didnt know there are so many steak options until i visited 1515 there are dry aged and wet aged  both with different taste and texture  the steaks were cook to our liking and the service was good  the bill  well it was to the high side but the whole dining experience was awesome , business triptoday went to 1515bar try the happy hoursfree flow drumstick and with planty choice of cocktailssprits just for 45rmbthe best deal in the townand the service was greatvery kind and keep refill the chicken there is one staff called chevaliereven can speak frenchalso is the sommelier of the bartake care me all the time feel back to europe if i come to shanghai next time will be come visite again for sure, im very enjoy here tonight james was very kindhe helped us take the menu from chophouse and recommended some delicious food for usi like this cocktail papa double, im steak lover and this is the best restaurant ever in china for steak
the price for steak is probably to high but if you want a quality meat this is the right place they have a good wine list with also many good wine a reasonable price considering where is located i love the atmosphere and the service is very professionally number 1, my friend and i decided to give 1515 west a try for the free sliders which honestly were better than mortons ever where and happy hour cocktails so glad we did food was great and the manager made our simple thursday week night one for the books one example she heard us eyeing this beautiful silver mug of beer as she delivered it to another table and before we had a chance to ask about two complementary mugs where at our sides now thats what i call good service, the layout of the bar has many semiprivate sections and booths hence ensures privacy and the background music is just about the right volume upbeat yet you can still socialize  which if you think about it is hard to balance the cocktail list is impeccable well designed and well executed also because they choose real quality base liquors not same bgraders you normally find in bars in china the bar food is great although a bit on the expensive side to take a special note the bar manager macarena rotger is fabulous she surely knows how to bring the party to you trust me james is fab too and dont get me started with the happy hour it is insanely good value there, been going to 1515 as a regular customer now the cocktails they make are outstanding they do customized cocktails and always have something new and they also host great cocktail classes great atmosphere and you learn a lot more than just drinking if you are visiting shanghai and looking for the best cocktail place to go this has to be on your list, attended the cocktail mixer was greeted by friendly staff especially the head mixologist macarena we had 3 different cocktails each came with its own food pairing the tequila with burned orange was my fav

a great place for a drink as the bar overlooks kerry center, we went to 1515 west for one of the mixology classes it was a beautiful evening with amazing drinks delicious food and great people hope to soon have the chance again for joining thank you dear macarena for the perfect organization, personally i think this is the best steakhouse in town the service is a little behind sometimes but the steak is just unbelievable, great steak the best you can find in shanghai drinks view and food all are great a little overpriced but it worth it, had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago after being in and out of shanghai for last 8 years its definitely one of the best steak houses in the city

grill restaurants come and go every day in shanghai but this one seems to continues to be a leader i suggest bone in ribeye and you have to see you the new york cheesecake definitely blown away

service very good the wine sommeliers not intimidating recommends good reasonable wines of the reasonable price sometimes you go to restaurants and they always recommend a super expensive can safely say will definitely back it will the near future, james is an incredibly hospitable staff willing to help as much as possibleive already took great interest in 1515bar about all the promotion he talked to mewed like to have dinner tomorrow there, very good service by james very good drink here its too busy tonight but we really enjoyed james told me about information about their mixologist class its free for the guests thats sounds good and happy hour time during 57 pm free floor sliders, its sundaywe come here for enjoy happy hour its james recommend for us very good price just 45 per drink and free floor mini burger very good service, ive lived in shanghai for the past 3 years and 1515 has been my refuge on friday evenings great service great happy hour from 5pm to 8pm excellent cocktails and a good jazz relaxing environment i definitely invite you to enjoy this relaxing bar, been several times either for drinks or dinner at the bar fantastic place with great music and ambiance james is the man he always takes excellent care of his guests, thanks to james and phillip very good service and good recommendation had very good time in 1515 and good band happy hour sounds lovely will try next time also will attend the cocktail lesson, fantastic drinks really good cocktails excellent and friendly staff philipp was really taking good care of us and the deal  45 rmb including unlimited buger sliders  is exceptional the deal is running until sept 30 so you better hurry up really nothing one should miss the location is also nice and classy, i like the cocktail here when you come here james is always the staff serve you helpfully they have a free entry mixology class every friday band start on wednesday to saturdaythaks james give us too much information about it, great deal for happy hour nice music great ambiance and great service by james oh and by the way the cloven club and beef slides are a must try, relax to cool tunes with nana the singer saxophonist and her pianist ringing in a friday evening unwindwith fabulous service from the delightful jamesa very nice person that give you the perfect service and the complimentary sliders perfect way to start your weekend, had great cocktails in 1515 west with nice service and ambiance we met james who took care of us and discovered they have happy hour everyday until end of september also live band in the evening  great place we recommend, great atmosphere and amazing staff happy hour is an absolutely amazing deal free flow wagyu beef sliders with the purchase of one 45 rmb drink ask for james when you come and you will not be disappointed with your service","Spanish cuisine",0.383371236926916
120,"there plenty of places to eat around but few of them have original food and good drinks with chill out music ingredients are of good quality the patatas bravas are a must hamburger is great try also the slow cook lamb sandwich they have good juices and i also recommend the vietnamese coffee, dont tell me that if you live in shanghai you have never taken friends or relatives to tianzifang
and thats what i did and kommune cafe is the perfect place where to sit and rest during or after having visited all the shops in the area
i love the outside tables in the very small square and i use those also in winter weather permitting
the service is good and the coffee is good as well
recently i discovered that they started to make promotions on beers normally those are from small breweries and the deal was buy one get one
when we went we had a pretty good ipa
i like the place, we were only intending to stay for a quick bite to eat but the accidental company of two swedish people turned this into more drinks than food the area is gorgeous and we were able to sit outside for what was decent food there are english speaking waiting staff so the process is easy there is a standard menu of european food which was good  the swedes had lasagne which they declared as good prices are mid range and it is value for money here be prepared to be photographed if you are european  it seems the chinese like to stroll around and get a glimpse of such that is good fun too well worth looking around the artsy area if you want a low key stroll, just had a coffee was good served in a glass pot they have seating outside and it was great sitting in the sun its a nice area small pedestrian streets with shops, burger and juice was good but average location and atmodphere is rather cool wort visiting would come back on a spring day, this hidden gem is owned by a melbournian so the coffee is good it can be a bit too hot but generally every coffee ive had there is great the big breakfast is big all in all a cool little spot to eat drink and watch people also but the coffee takeaway to get one of their cool coffee glasses, a nice little cafe in the middle of the french quarter kommune cafe offers breakfast smoothies and burgers in an innovative and delicious manner a must do, i been here more that once with friends family and solo good central location to take a break from tianzefeng wandering like the drinks all he been great got a wrap the other day but had way too much sauce i like overhauled food but even for me it was much get ur sauce on the side enjoy outside if poss lovely spot to chill, in the heart of tianzifang kommune is an easy pick if you are not feeling too brave experimenting with local dishes and other foreigners are a sign of comfort

kommune boasts of being a winebar serving fairly simple but rather expensive cafe food sandwiches and tapas etc

no idea about their wines as i had a beer but go there for the tianzifang district atmosphere which can be a much welcomed break from the malls and busy streets of shanghai, really cool place to chill and have a drink after walking around at tianzifang their drinks and cocktails were great , kommune is one of the best places we found in the tianzifang neighborhood they have a nice inside bar area with tables where you can eat if the weather is poor additionally they have a nice patio with tables outside kommune is a great place to grab a beer in the afternoon or grab some delicious food with quick and friendly service in the morning for brunch all around 5 stars, my husband  i went here for brunch and twas one of our best sat brunch ever
everything we had such us big daddy that comes with spicy bloody mary hummus  burgers were simply perfect  burgers that i had was delish i don�t normally order burger but this was the best tasting i�ve ever earthen service was very good i�m impressed and don�t miss out their cocktails i must say they have the best cocktails in town mojitos our fav and moscomule

recommended will definitely come back, simply sensational ive been all over the world and even though its not the best in the world its unbelievably good all things considered, stopped in here on a whim while wandering around tan zi feng and were not disappointed great frappucino espresso chicken sandwich and carrot cake can sit outside and people watch free wifi, very cool place to get breakfast or brunch fresh juices and international breakfast
its also nearby the market so you can have a walk around after, bloody marys are great nice little place to snack chat and drink great atmospherego and try it out, we had some pretty good food and coffee here my burger was surprisingly better tasting than i expected seating was hard to come by outside and a little cramped but still a reasonably quiet place to relax and eat in shanghai, half priced cocktails for happy hour is good if you can find it ordered a mojito  excellent  and bruschetta  not my favourite the bread strips came with sugar presumably to cut the acidity of the roast tomatoes service is great and fun ill order something different next time but ill definitely be back, or maybe thats just me and my sense of direction located in amongst a rabbit warren of shops and restaurants is this great little cafe friendly staff who speak english we were only here for drinks and had great coffee beer  you can not really go wrong with and cocktails all big servings only problem is it is very popular with locals and tourist, i dined here a few times with family that was visiting a very cozy fun place to dine they serve fantastic juices portions are large  food is simply great one can also walk around and shop as its surrounded with little cute cafes and shops selling art jewelry crafts  clothes overall a nice family hangout area with good food i find the cutleries all in a bag which is rather cute  unique place is always pack with foreignersso if you want a quiet dining this is definitely not it, the kommune cafe is not exactly the kind of restaurant you expect to find when you stroll through the old and quaint shopping area of tianzifang where tourists can buy all the paraphernalia they need to prove to their friends at home that they have been to shanghai decorated with revolutionary graffiti the restaurant offers very capitalist food like salads wraps and sandwiches we tried one of each chicken sandwich lamb wrap and the vietnamese chicken salad

all three were truly delicious however my wife who had the chicken sandwich developed some stomach pain about an hour later which lasted till the next morning  the timing was very suspicious and what i didnt like was that they serve the chai latte already sweetened much sweeter than i like it  i think they should leave it to the guest how much sugar he wants to put in, every time i got to shanghai i take the time to have a coffee here it is also a good place to meet friends and catch up it is ownedrun by australians is my guess so the coffee has a distinctly australian style flatwhite longblack etc the space is cool and the food good it can get busy but that is the cost of being good it can be hard to find but the immediate area is interesting to wander through so thats not a big cost just factor in 15 mins of wandering time if its your first visit, i been staying in shanghai for 3 years and kommune is one of the restaurant i first visit before moving to shanghai in 2007 not disappointing they has been well maintained very well in term of renew the food menu good atmosphere is always
as expatriate in shanghai dining  wining is of the must do routine in shanghai with friends and family so kommune is one of the best place to introduce for all season and always pleasant, ive been there several times now and have not been disappointed with the food or the service although you can wait a bit if you are right on lunch time l always go early about 1130 to miss the rush

food is pretty good and service is pleasant, i give it 5 stars just for the hot chocolate which is amazing
great ambience to place and feel very chilled when i go there
not eaten there but food looked good, busy at times in the bustling local shopping area all foods and drinks come in special preparation and presentation outdoor seating area, this used to be one of my favorite places to go to on the weekend just went last saturday and the prices went up its now just way overpriced the menu is limited i wanted the amazingly awesome potato wedges but was told they will no longer have any fried food ever bummer as the wedges and a bloody mary was always the way to go after a long night out bloody marys are now 88rmb or $1400 thats for one as a vegetarian your options are even more limited they got rid of the awesome falafel wrap and have some random curried veggie burger now which you cant even get fries with or chips for that matter id say skip kommune till they bring back their old menu and lower theyre prices

wait i forgot to mention that there is now a 125 service charge on weekends and during peek times seriously do they know we are in china bu hao

they could use larger tables too, this is a great little quirky restaurantbar settled in a nice yard in tianzifang first impression was that this is more a place for drinks but the food was really a positive surprise from the salmon bagel with poached egg to the various hamburgers and lets be honest if you have a drink you will get hungry at some point service can struggle sometimes as the place can get very busy but that has never irritated me so far and they try their best to keep things going
so if you want a nice place to sit outside do people watching have a drink and eat food which is seriously better than the average shanghai bar food this is a great place to go, i went to the wine democracy last monththis was very nice and pleasant
the waiters were great and the entry quite cheap i recommand this place , so nice placegreat location have really friendly staff many special food its amazing place to have afternoon with your friends, this is a quaint friendly cafe bar in tian zi fang ive eaten here several times and when busy the service can be slow on a slower day the service was very attentive i recommend the minestrone soup  comes in a thermous generous portion bloody marys are really great here sandwiches and wraps are all good even the veggie burger which is not my type of thing but someone else oredered was really good enjoy, decor and ambience definitely different food is okay not sure it is anything crazy even from a shanghai standard

everyone keeps writing about this big daddy being an americaniwould like to express that if we dont know anything we know breakfast this is not good breakfast and it would be hard to convince me this is average breakfast this is more just something thrown together with 8lbs of mushrooms

if you like eating with a shopping crowd and smokers all over you then this is your scene i can appreciate maybe having a beer and crowd watching but this is no place to have a good meal with tree leaves landing on you whenever the wind gets high and people walking on top of you if your sitting outside

with all the great rating i have to wonder if i should lower my expectations for shanghai, funky menus  seating opens out to the most open area within tian zi fang can be a little pricey but worth the ambiance, hard to find in the little village but once you do you will be coming back regularly the cocktails are great with german beers and the hot chocolate is definitely an experience think giant ball of chocolate melting in a cup the courtyard is great to sit in when the suns out and if the wind gets up there are blankets available for use but seats and spaces fill up quickly due to its popularity, i tried this for sunday brunch and it was great right in the middle of an interesting little village tianzifang this is good for peole watching but i think better for a good brunch good coffee and the omelette with chili was very good service great from a filipina and her english helped matters we spent another 45 minutes just wandering around the stores good fun, i came here with a friend who had been recommended to come the atmosphere is great with a funky ambience served on the side the mushroom soup is incredible honestly the best ive ever tasted tourist prices but you expect that in a tourist area even though im an expat local i would certainly come back to try their brunch, obviously kommunes weekend brunch has to be my favorite because they have generous portions and flavor is spoton i have been here at least 3 times and i would always recommend my friends to try their big daddy breakfast i enjoyed their lasagna and smashed avocado with goat cheese on toast however nothing beats their signature brunch dish i tried their srilankan latte and loved it
tried calling for reservations but it was not possible so i just did walkin however getting a seat here during brunch hours definitely requires patience however the host tries to manage the outdoor seating as quick as possible location is quite difficult to find for firsttimers just wish the food service were quicker and tables were bigger but atmosphere food quality and value is excellent, this place does fantastic food its a little hard to find down the narrow lanes of tianzifang but its worth the effort we tried their avocado and tomato smash which comes with bacon toast and a fried egg wow it was good also the salmon bagel  two halves of the bagel each loaded with heaps of salmon a poached egg and lovely tasty sauce and they do flat white coffee  very good and served unusually in a sort of widerimmed jar ill be back there for sure, a very cute funky quirky little place in tian zi fang shanghai a great little spot to people watch and take a break from the hustle and bustle that is shanghai great coffees and service and atmosphere staff are friendly and perfectly bilingual you can have starbucks just about anywhere try this for a change, a incredabal place for quick snack
i realy likesthe how they surve everthing 
the coctails are real good and the fresh a very interestingthe staff are english speeking which is very dificult to find here, i love kommune it is well designed and has a great atmosphere generally the food is great but hiccups do happen especially when it is busy at the weekend the staff are friendly and helpful and quick to solve issues id go for the avacado and tomato smash from the brunch menu and the banana latte smoothie is delicious, the restaurant itself is located in a nice little yard where you can enjoy your meal and drink surrounded in a relaxed atmosphere

the servers are very welcoming and quick to serve you upon arrival the meal are in the average price range eg pesto tuna sandwich for 68 rmb and a drink up 20 rmb

the meals served are more of western style which nicely fits into the neighbourhood

i would recommend this restaurant to everyone who is looking for a small snack or one course meal especially during the hot daytime, the first thing i tried when i touched down on shanghai  kommune its easy to spot in tian zi fang and has an indoor area and alfresco hungry from all the hassle and walking i ordered bruchetta spring rolls and of course  coffee the portion is big enough to share between 2 persons i highly recommend to try their coffee i had their signature coffee  kommunist the overall dining experience is good its start pack up by afternoon just hope that the cafe can consider to change the small tiny table to something bigger its really difficult to relax while trying to be careful of not to drop food  spoons worst  glass or plate, most breakfast restaurants in shanghai dont open until 1011am on the weekends which is way too late for an early riser like me kommune opens at 7am and serves a brilliant breakfast its quite a funky venue and serves things in a funky way well worth the visit especially early before the tourist crowds set in around 11am and tianzifang turns into a zoo of people, good coffee can be hard to find but here they seem to have hit on a good brew and talented barista loved the quirkyness and the staff were great, love this place delicious melbournestyle brunch menu in a gorgeous setting away from the hustle and bustle of shanghai nice to just read the paper and chill out could spend the whole day people watching big mug bowls of hot choc and surrounded by lots of cool shops and stalls definitely worth a visit to fuel up in the morning before a big day of sightseeing loved it, very easy to spend a whole day here nice and relaxing with great food and drink prices are in the middlehigh side of things but worth every penny, a hidden gem in the middle of an old part of shanghai although pretty touristic but this place isnt the drinks are great and huge prices in the uppermiddle scale
its an oasis in the buzz of the city
didnt try the food, this is a great little spot they have great juice infusions and lovely coffee drinks i had the brunch and was really impressed its best to go during the week as there is very limited seating this is one of the most fun parts of shanghai and keep browsing for many cool shops, awesome place to stop into while shopping in tianzifang we stopped for beer and cocktails but everyone else in the place was drinking coffee the espresso martini my friend got smelled amazing and she said it tasted even better they sell the adorable glass milk jugs and coffee mugs for tourists at reasonable prices for a gift to take home such a great place to relax and people watch inside or on their patio during great weather highly recommend","Spanish cuisine",0.999819972941275
121,"went there after a long travel to shanghai and really enjoyed their coffee and bananamango bread the prices are a little bit high but the food salads soups cakes  look delicious the music in the cafe is nice alternative and so is the furniture and deco i am sure you can stay there for a while without getting bothered similar to starbucks
i am not sure if its a chain but i saw two other subsidiaries in shanghai, trendy health cafe serving awesome and delicious food and amazing juices and smoothies i also found the takeout to be a godsend deffo a place for breakfastbrunchlunch half priced lunch if you get there before 10am, i usually go to wagas to work and have a cup of coffee the food is fine and you know what to expect service is of course at the chinese standard but thats alright

they have this carrot cookie which makes my day as long as it had some time to defrost, very nice for people who want eat some mediterranean fast menu it is not the best mediterranean restaurant but it is nice the fact you can taste so many mediterranean products like macheronni with cheese and ham or chorizo in shanghai
it deserves to go, i ate here on my first day in shanghai and ordered the vegetable curry with rice as well as an americano the food was amazing and the employee also helped me log into the wifi network with his local number as i did not have a chinese number giving it a 4 because it is definitely on the pricier side 77 rmb for rice dish and small americano definitely still recommend it for everyone seeking clean comfortable environment with good food, i like this eatery
you order at the counter and take a number to your table
someone then brings your order to the table
i ordered spaghetti boll it was very good  i also had one of their fesh juices
this was delicious
you can sit inside or outside
good quality and good value, really beautiful little cafe with great food choices coffee teas etc really friendly staff beautiful decor and well priced a must when in china, after a long 10 days of chinese cuisine even for breakfast wagas was an incredible tasty light healthy western taste, after days of being tired of chinese food finally we found a cafe with kale quinoa and rye bread everything we had were delicious, wagas offers some really good food which often is healthy and reasonably priced

what bothers me is their lack of sense of service its extremely and i mean extremely poor often they sell their favourite dish no they often sell out various dishes so when you ask them do you have this or this dont be surprised the answer is no

next to this they pretend to be modern and offer some service through wechat but more often than not when theyre faced with an issue a customer has they pretty much ignore you or tell you got hell not that direct but the message is clear however they have no problem in spamming you on a daily basis with chinese advertisements while they have a huge english customer basis youd think they do bilingual advertisements but again no compliments get answered immediately by the way lol

i used to be a big customer with them but their arrogant lack of service has me going to element fresh more often instead, good small simple menu well presented good prices and tasty food across the road from ms tasty smoothies and spinach wraps, nice staff free wifi very good coffee spinage wrap with chicken curry is more than delicious cafe latte very good, finding a good coffee in shanghai is tough to find but wagas do it better than most and very consistent to regardless of which location you visit

i have been coming to wagas for my coffee fix for over 2 years as my number 1 choice in shanghai there are now numerous locations across shanghai so they are becoming more conveniently located

the stores can at time appear to be cramped especially when numerous people are there but still very much worth the effort

free wifi is easy to obtain when you register and there is also a really good selection of western style meals  pastas salads and sandwiches for when you just need a break from chinese food

wagas is my regular each weekend and a great place to have a good coffee and or meal and just do some reading or catching up with friends, i had a hard time choosing a dish because a lot seemed really good and exciting i ended up taking a sandwich with shrimps it was delicious the portion was fine for a lunch and you pay for the quality

the venue is nice located and is quite spacey the staff is really quick but food does not arrive at the same time, the food in general is good quality the food was on the table after 7 minutes of ordering it which was incredible the pasta with pesto was really good good size proportion and warm

the service was poor the staffs english is almost zero and some of the people were super kind and enthusiastic but fx the cashier was super rude he looked bored looked away many times during order and generally was not kind

i would recommend if you are in the city and miss some oldschool simple european food, i travel to shanghai frequency for work and this is my favourite place to get decent healthy western food everything j have had is delicious quick friendly service would
definitely recommend if youre looking for healthy western food beautiful wraps sammiessaladsjuicss etc, after being in shanghai three months and always passing busy wagas establishments i finally went for lunch its very good i loved the menu options everything seemed fresh i got the chicken curry salad in a spinach wrap and it was delicious i visited the wagas in pudong in big thumb plaza but its not in trip advisor the service was fast friendly and the restaurant was clean my plate was taken away soon after i finished i also had an iced coffee and chocolate cookie with cashews the iced coffee was fine but the cookie was very tasty i will definitely be going back, this is a good place to grab some delicious food for lunch they offer a nice selection of sandwiches and salads or combos western and asian they also have some nice blended drinks that are a nice healthy mix, i discovered a wagas very close to my apartment and decided to try it out

the outlet is well maintained and the sandwich i wanted wasnt available

i decided to try out the green curry chicken set

the set came with white rice and was fairly decent the curry was flavorful without being spicy and the chicken pieces were well cooked and tender

a good place to go when you need a quick meal, its not as good as panera but the same concept the major win for this chain is that its consistent i used to go there 23x week but lately ive been bored with their menu aside from the daily specials which do change based on whatever starting to go its generally always the same again sometimes consistency is good the thing is its only healthy ish lots of extra oil mayo sauce dressing and i guess use light oil hasnt come up in my chinese lessons yet when my friends from the us come to visit this is their preferred go to for an easy breakfast thats not steamed buns or beijing pancake i recommend the egg pesto for breakfast about $10 us or the spinach wrap for a quick lunch soups are also really great in the winter, wagas are a popular chain in shanghai a little bit like eat or pret in the uk they offer great coffee and teas fresh fruit juices smoothies and cakes they also have a nice range of freshly prepared sandwiches wraps and salads for a more substantial meal they also have pasta dishes and thai curries special offers often include a half sandwich and salad for example these are great alternatives for a quick light bite in shanghai with quick and efficient service and well worth a visit there is also free wifi once youve signed up, i ate here with friends living in shanghai it was a quick bite before we took a tour of the city
everyone was satisfied with their meals but i would say the food was good but not great
i ordered the pasta bolognese and it was very light on the sauce and did not have much flavor
everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals and the portions were reasonable
i wouldnt go out of my way to eat here but would definitely try it again if i was in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite, great concept that could be better executed the staff are really friendly the service is efficient the place is relaxed and comfortable good menu pity the food is not better its ok but it could be great and this place would be legendary
i had different versions of the breakfast over two days the eggs were average the bacon disappointing, a little over priced for being in shanghai but for eestern food you need to pay
one chicken cesars salad cost around 110 rmb 17usd app
but the quality very nice fresh products and believe that you really need this being in china, what you get is a place to relax for a while a good selection of fresh mixed juices and salads and other healthy eats when combined with a working wifi you can do worse in shanghai than sit down at a wagas, these are located all over sh and are pretty standard they are normally in busy shopping centers so they can get quite crowded most have a nice outdoor seating area

the best dishes to get are the pastas the portions are large and will definitely fill you up i suggest the pesto pasta its very good and very filling

smaller menu simple food what you ask for is what you get, staff very friendly and menu easy to understand quality also good and capuccino tasty like italian one salmon sandwhich was fresh too, i visited shanghai in august 2015 for a four week language school program and i was amazed by the city including how much good quality food there is i love food and i found a good western fast food restaurant named wagas they are a chain restaurant and they have multiple locations around the city they have great pasta i always had the tuna with pene pasta as well as salads and you have to try the smoothies as well great value and great service places like wagas make shanghai a pretty easy place for western folks like me to visit, this restaurant offers basic hearty fare with an emphasis on vegetarian and homemade pasta

my pasta dish with pumpkin and feta was most unusual but quite delicious

i think wagas is a dependable spot for tasty food from brekkie through dinner, a favorite lunchtime spot when you crave a sandwich or salad equally good for a quick breakfast the service is good the servers all speak pretty good english and so you can practice your mandarin and still make it through an order great falafel sandwich our favorite, excellent teas and coffees good healthy sandwiches and light lunches including chicken spinach fritters with avocado and lime pasta with parmesan and olive oil black bean and avocado wrap plus good quality aussie wine by glass great for brekkie as it opens at 7am 7 days a week and have their own bakery making bread crossants and cakes a little on the expensive side but well worth it in our view, came across wagas for the first time and was immediately tempted to give it a shot the menu is quite tempting for western food in an eastern country tried one if the soups and pasta both were served quickly and quality of food is good and feels healthy would love to try the very interesting salads next time which would make for a healthy snack for lunch ambience is quite nice too and staff helpful for its class of restaurant this is a good choice and should be seriously considered, stopped by here for dinner with friends before we all left the city there is a pretty good selection and the pastas are excellent you get a decent portion and the food is delicious as is typical of shanghai it is quite expensive but if you want a good sitdown meal then definitely check this place out, the salads are amazing dont miss the pumpkin cous cous salad or the mango avocado with grain mustard dressing, usually for me healthy food is not so appealing  at wagas the food is consistently excellent tasty and healthy and fast and very affordable, wagas has been around shanghai and now other areas for some time it is clean and the decor is quite good the food is just ok nothing special or creative it is incredibly expensive for what is offered the service is similar to mc donalds there is none however mc donalds is cheap crap where as wagas is expensive not quite crap without any service

the coffee is once again just ok there is nothing here that is above average this is a successful business but that means nothing concerning quality, i loved the daily offer always a fresh ingredients soup  perfect after meal you should try the wagas ginger ice tea, its a good place to get western food specially when you are looking for a healthy option but overall the food is just kind bland it is good on occasion but i wouldnt highly recommend it also it is on the pricier side which adds to the disappointment, every time i go to shanghai i go to this restaurant where you will find a large choice of healthy food  salads pasta juice smoothie cakes etc
the concept is really nice you will find a good value for money and you will also have a decent wifi connection which is not the case everywhere in shanghai
my favourite meal is the ceasar salad one of the best i have ever tried, these restaurants serve consistently good moderately priced food and you can stay for as long as you like soaking up the relaxing atmosphere my only complaint would be the wobbly round tables however i wouldnt let this minor detail stop me going back again and again, wagas west nanjing road shanghai  conveniently placed near a metro stop nanjing road west wagas provides a good selection of food and reasonable portions although more expensive almost western prices than nearby noodle bars the variety and quality combined with the atmosphere  environment upstairs is quieter make it a preferred stop for a quick dinner chicken caesar or tuna salads pasta dishes and thai curries are all favourites and their juices are excellent especially the lemonade it is popular so get their early in the evening as your favourite dishes run out, wagas on xianxia lu hongqiao shanghai� no longer what it used to be at the cashier you get the impression of being rushed i ordered the daily special chorizo rocket salad sandwich and tomato soup the soup was cold the sandwich was a mishmash of haphazardly put together ingredients not pleasing to the eye it took them 15 minutes to warm my soup wagas used to be a good place to go for quick and delicious wraps sandwiches or pasta with great and friendly service now its not even quick anymore except at the cashiers it was quite a disappointment and a let down service is mediocre wait staff impolite i will not go back again, alyternatively to baker and spice we went to this place near home to have breakfast excellent pain au chocolate and cappuccino if you go before 1000 am during weekend you can get nice combo promotion that discounts your coffee or cappuccino by 50 relaxed style and nice service, reasonably affordable western food in china with good authentic flavours i love their selection of fresh juices but be aware ure meal and a large juice can pretty much cost u the same their portions are reasonably small but filling, its a chain similar to element fresh offering great salads wraps and smoothies it has a coffee shop atmosphere so many people hunker down with their laptops i enjoy wagas more than element fresh because the food seems fresher and more creative lentil and beet root salad with a spinach wrap veggie sandwich yum but they are essentially the same thing again wagas is more coffee shop style so the menu is more limited but it has a cozy and comfortable atmosphere its my goto i know what im going to get and that ill be happy and full , great juices pasta dishes and salads i would recommend sitting upstairs for a little more quiet as it can get quite busy, once you spend enough time in shanghai there will be days when you need a break from the perpetually overcooked local food dripping with strong flavored sauces made too often out of poor quality ingredients your body aches for some fresh raw vegetables light easy to digest but not bland or boring in any waywagas this chain is spread out through shanghai usually at large shopping malls or plazas and frequented by a near perfect balance between western and asian customers contemporary decoration hipp youthful concept but most of all the high quality ingredients used make this the perfect lunch dinner or just in between snack spot for those craving a change while the sandwiches are all good the pastas are just delightful and if you dare to try and feel like youll work it off latergo for some of the over the counter desserts a personal favorite of mine on rushed week days is the breakfast special spinach wrap with feta cheese bacon and a few other goodies combined with a signature wagas ice coffee cation there is a wagas ice tea as well  not bad but not the same take it on the go and your morning is saved did i mention that the price is surprisingly competitive, nice place to get a break from the chinese food prices are reasonable chicken pesto wrap is recommended as well as the numerous smoothies that go down a treat in the heat, daughter took us here so we could have some western food and it did not disappoint chicken wrap was very good and the carrot cake was not too bad either not bad, wagas is a restaurant chain in shanghai i like very much the price is honest there are many options of healthy food pastas etc its a good place fir western people that are not used to chineses food","bar",0.999841700116699
122,"on a business trip we went for a walk in the former french concession and discovered this crazy authentic breton restaurant with great crepes and french wine  even the waiters wearing bretonstriped shirts naturally the place is decorated like a proper breton creperie nice, i come often to la creperie as i come from brittany i am always missing the taste of our crepes and galettes lucky me we have la creperie in shanghai to satisfy me they have a good selection of galettes which are really tasty they also offer different variety of french food for those who do not like galettes, we ordered their specialities and were not disappointed their ingredients are fresh especially the smoke salmon crepe though their flambeed crepes had way too much alcohol that it overpowered the flavor of the crepe but overall a great experience, it is nice sometimes to change from chinese food and la creperie is really french style dinner there is an extensive menu and at each visit to shanghai it is a must go for enjoying a french meal the service is very good, have been a customer for la creperie for a few years we used to go quite often but recent visits were disappointing too much sauce on the sweet crepes and the service was just soso very sad to see that theyve become such a state, cozy and brittany decor authentic crepes with wide range of choices weve been a few times and had great food every time, when ever i see a creperie i must go in and try the crepes this place i have been many times before and the crepes savory or sweet are a real delight

other food is very nice too and all is reasonable in price

if you have the chance to go there on mondays you are lucky to try the moules

i will be back soon , one crepe is sufficient for two i would say particuarly if you have a starter and want a dessert the brittany apple juice is excellent
some comment about the service and while it is not as attentive as we may be used to in china i think its fine and actually quite responsive when you ask
save space for a crepe suzette i usually dont have dessert but i did make an exception for this, very good crepes quality food good location
the only comment i have is with regards to service which needs more attention
customers have to wave to have attention the waiters are not really focusing towards tables
they forgot some order i ordered a second coffee during my lunch which was forgotten
even for the bill i had to ask twice to two different persons as the first one acknowledging my demand did simply forget to print and bring it to the table
service serviceservice, la creperie is a restaurant that i wanted to try out after going to la cabane several times note both restaurants have the same owners while i did enjoy the food this isnt a restaurant i will often go to as i prefer cheese and meat much more and la cabane is therefore a better choice for me that being said if you want to experience food from the northeast part of france i definitely recommend you to go there

special mention to the staff who are all very helpful and kind

if you go there with a bunch of friends you might want to go to the camel right after your dinner which is across the street if you are an arsenal fan go there, nice setting with a touch of french ordered a crepe with banana and caramel ice cream the presentation of the food is excellent and taste good too service staffs are friendly and well verse in english, the crepes are a generous size using fine ingredients i could not finish mine the restaurant was very busy at lunch  even so the staff was very attentive and polite it is authentic french food without pretense i would come back for sure, loved this place came here for my birthday and a few friends not only the decor is very much as of in northern france the service was nice french people delicious cider food and sweet crepes we were all really happy about the food the ambience and the prices too

ive lived 4 years in france so i can say that this is the real thing dont know of any other place where you can get reblochon cheese too for when you have that france nostalgia, if i could give a zero rating i would overpriced and bad quality definitely the worst experience not only in shanghai but out of any place we have ever been to anywhere in the world we ordered coffee and crepes the coffee was only lukewarm and bitter the cappuccino was mostly milk foam and a bit of lukewarm coffee and the coffee cup sizes were tiny 3 sips at the most the chocolate crepe was cold and stale and drizzled with cheap chocolate syrup not even nutella and a fattening dollop of runny cream gross never again what a ripoff, nice to eat crepes in shanghai big choice of any kind of crepes  very good cider made with calva  waiters are french so you will at home  tres bon accueil even the decoration is as in bretagne  je vous recommande cette adresse si vous etes un peu nostalgique , its always a pleasure to come and have some crepes and galettes at the creperie
good service good food comme labas and a cosy environment what else would you need on a cold and humid winter day, freshly made french style crepes galore at this cosy  relaxing restaurant at the former french concession choose from a wide selection from savory to sweet dessert style crepes the other items on the menu like the fish soup is a delicious option as well a must try for crepe lovers, nice original french crepes nice ambience  very friendly service kids friendly savory crepes are great  the traditional sweet crepes suzette is amazing, we really enjoyed our breakfast at this place
the personnel was very friendly and the menu offers a broad range of french food, although plates have a more than decent diameter we wish plates are bigger to have more ingredients are top quality staff hyper friendly
a place not to miss, the place has nice decent crepes the location is very nice in the heart of the french quarters of shanghai beautiful architecture and sycamore trees, their crepes are amazing a piece of bretagne in the middle of shanghai french concessionstaff are friendly and speak good english perfect to start your saturday nightlife prices are quite fair for shanghai, except the little attitude in the service i think this place is great a crepe isnt an expensive dish and they respected that their crepes are great and well made it tastes just like home make sure the chinese cook doesnt overlook the bottom of your crepe though if he does ask them to change it thats unacceptable good deal good location good food, you can find a lot of crepes and different french dishes all very good crepe with reblochon just delicious, i live nearby this french restaurant located in former french concession it is one of my kids favorite restaurants they like everything on the menu especially crepes filled with cheese and potatoes ambiance is nice and service is good, after two weeks touring china this was a welcome change quality was authentic french i had the crepe with cream sauce cheese chicken and mushroom my husband has the beef crepe and children had pastas all excellent sweet cider a nice refreshing drink and finished with sharing two dessert crepes owner is french and speaks english very amiable and helpful highly recommend, we enjoyed a wonderful brunch in the heart of the french concession delicious savoury crepes with cider were a real treat the crepe suzette was an outstanding finish, my parents were in town and we passed this restaurant thinking it looked cute we had a great overall experience at la creperie the staff was very friendly and attentive although we did come to the restaurant late they did not rush us out and even told us the chef would be leaving soon so if we wanted dessert to please put in an order we also ordered wine and the waiter suggested the cheapest bottle which was refreshing all of our crepes were delicious the wine was smooth and enjoyable and the atmosphere was pleasant my parents and i left very happy and i look forward to returning with friends, this is a real french creperie the owners are from brittany and know what theyre doing they even use real maille cornichons the cider is excellent and the savoury crepes are fantastic if youre looking for the real deal for a french creperie this is it highly recommended, i just came here for tea time and so was not very crowded crepes were just alright value is moderate, la creperie is a delicious restaurant chain for savory and sweet french crepes my boyfriend and i had the mondayfriday set lunch 11am2pm for 78 rmb which included one savory and one sweet crepe plus a discounted drink the crepes come with a small salad too we had the ham and cheese crepe and the butter sugar crepe both were excellent still hungry we also had a mushroom bacon onion and cream sauce crepe very good the restaurant has some cute outdoor seating and a very extensive menu with other noncrepe items like mussels and soup definitely worth a try restaurant opens at 11 despite the smartshanghaicom website saying 1030am, dimly light cosy restautant in the heart of french concession breton style deco and furnishing even the bill comes decorated with a breton pebble

real galette full house buckwheat taste personal favourite is their spicy chicken starter galette and the clasic le complete + dessert crepe with orange liquor

lovely fresh lemonade is also served their cider is also pretty good brut

in short le creperie is one those places that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside aftee your visit, the quality of both food and service is consistently very good great to be able to sample some of these brittany delicacies in shanghai  atmosphere is really nice too only thing the cider is pretty pricey but this doesnt stop us from going back whenever we can

123,"never be afraid to eat at yangs unless you are afraid of gettng your clothes dirty the dumplings are something that you cannot get anywhere except shanghai the soups make a perfect compliment to a 12 dozen dumplings either beef or duck blood are excellent you just cant go wrong at any yangs wish they would come to the usa, with all the fried dumplings we have had all over the world yangs is definitely the best of all all dumplings are moist with a small amount of soup and very light skin excellent value for your money and so are other dishes a restaurant one should not miss when visiting shanghai, the first time we tired the 3 different kind of dumplings prawns pork and veg at the shanghai station and we loved it we immediately bought the second tray each dumpling has lovely soup in it and it was great when they were freshly cooked

we saw another branch before we left shanghai and we tried it again even though we were not that hungry, i tried various yangs fried dumplings places it is a locals eating place many branches in shanghai and the food is divine i love dumplings and once you know how to eat them without getting boiling soup all over you and the person sitting next to you you are away they come on a plastic plate � we are not talking upmarket accessories here but from the first slurp� take wet wipes and pick them up with your hands if i was there today id be eating them, yangs dumplings are my absolute favorite i live across the street from one of these places and theyre just perfection wrapped in dough, yangs was recommended to me by a friend who had lived in shanghai for years it was an excellent recommendation the fried dumplings are some of the best food i had while visiting china the service is fast and friendly and while i usually ordered an assortment of dumplings i went here at least twice while in shanghai the shrimp dumplings were my favourite dont be afraid of the lines they seem to move quite fast and we never waited very long to be seated, i have been to china several times and wouldnt think of returning without getting to shanghai to visit yangs these dumplings are like nothing ive had anywhere in the world my traveling friend and is have searched all over california from san francisco to san diego and have not found dumplings that come close to yangs they are delicious there are several locations weve been to 4 different ones all are equally as good my only request that yangs would open restaurants in southern california i selected lunch for my review but we have had breakfast and dinner there as well looking for another opportunity to go to shanghai and eating at yangs will be at the top of my places to eat list this says a lot considering shanghai has an abundance of amazing places to eat, just go in and order one of the breakfast sets they are shown on pics on the counter where you order as you enter as you enter across from the service counter is a view of the staff making the dumplings wow what professionals  fast and fastidious remember the dumplings have soup in them nibble a hole and suck out the soup before you bit into the dumpling to avoid soup squirting over you and your table worst part of it is realising you have wasted the delicious soup no booking needed minimal waiting time plenty more tables upstairs, yangs fried dumplings are worth trying when youre in shanghai to avoid long lines i visited a branch outside of the city center the dumplings are slightly bigger than other soup dumplings and can be quite challenging to eat with chopsticks after one or two attempts i eventually got the hang of it

if youre tired of eating pork dumplings there are other options  like the spicy seafood dumplings its twice the price of the pork dumplings though, my absolutely most favourite food in shanghai i didnt like the soup that much cause i dont like coriander but the dumplings were really good its also a real challenge to eat them right cause fist you should bite a small hole in the dough and then slurp out the hot soupjuice before you eat the rest, dumplings are a must do in shanghai yangs are excellent there are many locations longyang road and biyun road are the ones we frequent because of where we live but they all offer the same we recommend the shrimp, my husband has been raving about this place so when i finally visited shanghai with him i came here to try the fried dumplings 4 meat dumplings cost rmb 8 they also have shrimp stuffing available and it costs more i think rmb 12 i bought take out but it was still good be careful when you take that first bite the juice may explode all over the bottom of the dumpling is crunchy and the rest of the skin was thin with the stuffing full of juice they have many stores so look it up to find one near you, we went around in circles before we were able to find their branch at the basement of cloud nine there were no crowd since it was before dinner time we ordered the set and the noodles came quick but the dumplings took some time and you had to claim it unlike the noodle soup which they brought to your table the dumplings were like xiao long bao because of the soup inside but its fried value for money because for the set they give you 2 bowls of noodles plus a plate of dumplings which we shared among 3 people, yangs dumplings is a really nice and cheap fast food chain in shanghai

you can choose between pork and shrimps dumplings they furthermore have different noodle soup

one serving contains 4 dumplings i love their shrimp dumplings crunchy bottom fresh tasty has hot soup liquid in it try it with some vinegar and chili too

one serving of 4 cost 16yuan ~ 2� their soup ranges from 816yuan

come outside lunch and dinner time as the restaurant will be very crowded takeaway also possible

staff here and in china generally dont speak english but menu has english and contains pictures, after reading the reviews on ta i was hoping that we will encounter the yangs fried dumplings on this trip it was a pleasant surprise that we actually bumped into one on the basement of this mall right near the hotel we were brought to on the first night of our tour wyndham bund east shanghai in yangpu district we ordered the original the combination and two soups we picked up the combination right away because they were done previously and sitting there instead of freshly made we were told it will take a few minutes to get the original meat dumplings fine we had time needless to say the fresh ones were much tastier than the premade ones i must say the juice inside made the dumplings much more delicious if only they made all their dumpling fresh about the two soups the curry flavored beef was the most terribly soup that i had it was so watered down that i didnt know if i was having curry soup or dirt water the stuffed bean curd pocket type was good though all in all i can only give them three stars for my disappointing meal i had much better dumplings else where for the price i suppose it was ok, from all the hype surrounding yangs fried dumplings you would not believe how eager i was to try it when i had the time to i ordered the 6 set 2 of each fried dumpling flavors and waited for a long 15 minutes to get what i desired as i was waiting i got front row seats to see how they made the dumplingswhich unfortunately made my appetite shrink of course as this is more streeteats kind of food reusing oil and using a lot of it should not be too much of an appetite killer
when i finally got my dumplings one bite in and delicious steamy meat juice oozed out the bottom was brilliantly crunchy and the skin was perfectly cooked the dumpling is among the best ive eaten however i must say eat this the day you buy it because when it gets cold it looses the crunchiness and it becomes no more than a soggy dumpling, the hype is true these dumplings are absolutely amazing easy to find place with a few tables to dine in but mostly a togo place they have a picture menu since it might be hard to order if you only speak english the prices are so cheap you can try them all the dumplings are huge 4 in a order one order is enough for one but you will want to try all the varieties they are that good i liked the pork and shrimp the best its a few cents more to get a bag to carry your dumplings with you worth it be sure to ask, easily the best snack or light meal great representation of shanghai

yangs has many outlets more of a fastfood joint if you will order and payup at the counter dont expect english menus but you could point out your order to the counter staff courtesy of the pictures presented

it is really crowded during lunch and dinner hours and you may have to share a table with others so avoid those times if you dislike crowds or the added pressure to vacate your table for other patrons also for the dumplings you may have to self collect at a designated queue depending on outlets

yangs fried dumplings which comes in 4 pcs deep fried is a must order costs 8 yuan at time of this writing you should also try the san ping which is a 3 type combo 2each totalling 6 pieces featuring meat pork shrimp vegetable chives for 16 yuan the soup within the dumplings is simply awesome let it ooze out if you like but take care for it is hot

there are also a variety of noodles in soupy broth should you desire a bigger meal a bowl would cost between 12 to 15 yuan mostly consisting of a choice of meat with fried tofu and vegetables the noodles will be served to your table no need for self collect

the dumplings leaves you contemplating on when is your next visit it is that good please do try, great stop for lunch if you are testing the local cuisine safe choice to try out your luck with chopsticks picking up huge dumplings is a challenge for any skill level but still fun, cheap cheap xiaolongbaos which were pretty good you could get way better ones in nanxiang or ding tai fung but im pretty sure those were the cheapest

it was really decent and you got to see them in the process which was pretty cool as well, visited the yangs dumplings in the pudong district near the oriental pearl tower more upscale than the downtown one we tried in february sort of like a mcdonalds where the key dish to order is the soup dumplings four cost 6 rnb about 90 cents no beverages i could see english wording on the wall menu but dont expect anyone to speak english dumplings slightly bigger than golf balls filled with soup surrounding a pork meatball get a plastic soup spoon to go with the chopsticks its an amazing local meal, we were recommended this restaurant and enjoyed a number of meals here other customers were happy to share tables and assist in the ordering when needed the soup is very hot so be careful but we went back you watch the food being cooked so know that it is fresh also dirt cheap, great dumplings served fast and very cheap <u+00a5>6 for 4 dumplings be careful when you bite in as the soup is burning hot its worth the burn though, we have been to shanghai a few times and always look forward to returning just for these famous dumplings the place is only a short walk from the main street and the place isnt that big or glamorous but at us$1 for a plate of 4 great dumplings l will go there anytime l am in shanghai, similar to the xiao long bao the shen jian is a local favorite

luckily this particular location does not get as busy as some of the others the delicious soup filled dumplings have a crunchy bottom and go nicely with some hot chili sauce do be careful and avoid biting into it aggressivelythe hot liquid inside can leave your clothes a mess

125,"mint is another very fancy venue in shanghai there is a great atmosphere and you can spend your entire night there, one of these locations you hear a lot aboutand once you see or experience them you understand why crazy on one side fascinating on the other big interesting cosmopolitan crowd on the weekends great partys , the views are stunning looking across to the high rises across the river

the bar area has an air of sophistication and when we visited not too busy looking at the antics of a small bunch of europeans opposite our group one of my fellow travellers pondered whether or not the large mural behind them was in fact a menu rather than a piece of dubious art see pic of mural

we had reserved a table in the main club area in exchange for a minimum spend the space was too crowded and we quickly gave up and returned to the bar and after one more drink returned to our hotel

prices will make your eyes water

clearly this is an important venue in the night life scene of shanghai and my overall feeling is that they know it, overrated in all senses posh place that has nothing original  you expect something exclusive when you finally can get through on exception basis if you have nit made a reservation air are not member  what a joly when liquid was dripping from the ceiling when standing in the toilets  i left to never return  i hope it was water, i was in a group event when i went to mint but my experience wasnt great they have chairs and tables where you can sit but only if you pay a lot of rmb for them so you sit there and drink and smoke and look good if you have money to spend not just for anyonethe rest of the crowd will stand the staff were extremely rude to us and we let the manager know i also read in another review that the shark tank was cool i definitely do not see it like that it is bare and these poor things swim up and down with no plants or interesting things to hide inits cruel and horriblei would never advertise that as a highlight, this venue is impressive red carpet by invite only reception the night i went they had a playboy party so it was an interesting event you go up the elevator and enter a long corridor that features a tank with small black tipped sharks cruel in my opinion because of the vibrations in the air imagine how those sharks feel i doubt their sharks live long one you enter you see then main bar and to the right is large dance floor resident dj large screen the vibe can be infectious further into the bar is another section with another dj and bar playing a different type of music if youre a big fan of edm this might be a miss for you but if you just wanna hang lose and stuff then youd probably have a good time i really wanted to check this place out because everybody seems to have been  not dying to go back and to be honest i wish they didnt have the shark tank they should replace it with a cool interactive digital installation, great atmosphere  good food stunning skyline view we experianced a classy restaurant cocktail bar and fun at the club, loved this club

i am used to going to high end clubs in london dubai la really didnt think that the club scene in china would be popping but i was definitely proved wrong with this club

you do need to get yourself on the guest list prior to arrival but its worth it

oh and did i mention the shark tank that was pretty amazing for me

as a price guide
drinks approx 100 yuan each
tables approx 5000 yuan, i have to stop by m1nt for their cod fish and truffle butter mashed potatoes every time im back in shanghai a dinner there usually beats my bank account back by 1000 2000 rmb but honestly so worth it i had the pleasure of meeting amore whom i assume is the manager he was so kind and friendly it was my friends first time in shanghai so he sent him the pictures he had on his phone which showed the progress and development of the city i would recommend going for a late dinner with cocktails so by the time youre done eating you could either hit up the lounge area or directly to the club dont forget to stop by the shark tank on the way out , what an amazing club decor is impressive with the huge shark tank music is really good for partying all night long and you get to mingle with an interesting mix of classy expats and shanghainese, when you visit this nice city you must included a night out in mint really super food lounge bar is perfect and if you want one of the best night clubs in town all located on 1 floor with view on the bund its not a cheap place but ok  thats life , on our first visit to the mint as strongly recommended by a cousin who has lived in shanghai for more than 10 years it is one where my wife and i look forward to our visit excitedly
imagine our dismal disappointment when the cab driver brought us to a building that looked so ordinary and kind of rundown
we were greeted by an attractive and friendly lady at the lobby entrance and directed to the lift which took us to the restaurant and club and behold the amazing transformation of elegantly designed bar and restaurant with an open kitchen and views of the bund simply took our breadth away with single and long tables arranged in a manner that is not overly close there is space for private chats and a romantic time with a table by the window the view of the river with the lighted boats was just awesome
the md mr danielo hoti is a wonderful friendly and humble host who is unassuming and always reaching out to serve
the food was just awesome and the pricing compared to singapore is certainly great value for money
check out the pictures below
the short ribs tuna tartar and black cod were excellent and must try dishes while duck breast was good ambience and service were definitely of high standards
after dinner we adjourned to the club next door and for my wife and i in our 50s it is like a trip down memory lane but with different kind of music  thumping instead of disco or rock
what an enjoyable evening
thank you m1nt and danielo
we certainly will visit you again, we had a great time in the club it was full of energy and the club is pretty big if u want to have a best night in shanghai u should try it there a friendly atmosphere too, i have been to mint on many occasions over the years and had many enjoyable and sometimes memory challenging evenings their with colleagues and friends

however on this occasion assisted by my good friend reijnaldo i was able to secure a booking in their restaurant and i am so glad that i did we had an amazing steak cooked perfectly and supplemented by a nice french wine selected from the very reasonable and extensive wine list

the service was excellent the location great and then we were able to enjoy the bar for a night cap

i will definitely return to try a little more of the menu  but if you are after a good steak in shanghai then i would give mint a go, mint club is a must visit place in shanghai if you want to unwind yourself and want to indulge yourself in electrifying music and wonderful drinks and great companions the atmosphere is happening and the music is pulsating friday and saturday nights are a specialty reach little late be around the bar counter and you never know with whom you hook up for a great evening come late in the evening do ensure that you book the slot in advance else you will be disappointed, ive visited the restaurant with a friend it was nice especially the view but it is overpriced clubbing is good for expats, a good club close to bund security could be more polite and smiley but once you are in the music and quality of the drinks all would satisfy you, i was invited over there with couple of friends  the place is very nice  music is not loud and the service is very good  i have enjoyed it after a hectic business day , top club with great restaurant perfect service by nice people dont forget to make a reservation on time, mint is that place where you will just always be happy at  great staff  food and most of all music  my butt still hurts from all the dancing ive been doing there for the last 6 years awesome place, i went to m1nt restaurant last night amazing dinner amazing table with the great view than moved to the club all night what an amazing place all in one restaurant lounge club and you get to see all shanghai from there 24th floor the best view you can ever get

the old m1nt staff and managers are back now and the original m1nt team is back the place is back and is happening the place to be, have visited here a number of times but with the incredible amount of choices with shanghai had to offer hadnt been back for a while
always a crazy experience to walk into see such a massive shark tank on arrival
as usual was absolutely jam packed music was pumping  champagne was flowing
its known amongst colleagues who live on shanghai for models  bottles on wednesday night, went twice very nice place ive been to this sort of clubs all over the world and even then this place is a tad more expensive than the usual 280� for a bottle of veuve rose is a good 80� or so more than the norm at these sort of clubs anywhere in the world service is good sometimes stifling depending on your server nevertheless i would return always busy good music i like it enough to ignore the downsides, ive been to mint many times and always enjoy it it is very stylish with nice drinks food and the famous fish tank with sharks the views at night are great  best in the city

now if you have the confidence and appearance they treat you well very well in fact if not you might struggle dont turn up with attitude  just go and enjoy, one of the best in the city extraordinary aquarium with small sharks inside very good music and beautiful view good cocktails and people, we had a fantastic meal with a great steak great vegetables perfect service one steak wasnt as we ordered but that was corrected quickly and without questioning service perfect from all of the staff very attentive after dinner we went to the bar big mistake the female bartenderworker was too busy fixing a drink for herself and minding her own business rather than serving us she told us to order from her college while she made a drink for herself  he did take our order after a while drinks were ok, this restaurant is a very fancy very expensive restaurant great food and drinks the view is the best part though i couldnt believe the view of the bund, food good great steak tartare and black cod expensive but the atmosphere is great good service and loved the shark tank roof top bar great place to chill, well  they select people on their appearance before letting them in i went there with 2 young danish girls which i met in my hotel and as im over 40 the arrogant door crew must have thought that i was a wealthy man ready to spill his fat wallet i was immediately offered entrance while others were told to bugger off the bar itself is dark loud music many expats a big fish tank with a shark in it and overpriced drinks every one acts his certain role the staff is very rude certainly the elevator boy  even aggressive but i can understand that for many people such venues are the hight at the end of their working week if yould like a table it will cost you 700 euro a month champagne not included well its totally up to chinese and western nouveau rich standards but dont expect class a place for wannabees, this is a pricy place members only but i managed to get it first time through a dinner booking and second time i bought a table for the night the music is great and loved the buzz though this is a more personal thing this is a trendy place so dress code is enforced, this seems to be where the to be seen crowd goes and it has plenty to offer not just a bar and restaurant but a nightclub as welli think membership is required and it seems expensive even for shanghai the hostesses greeting you were certainly part of the experience here at mint the views from the restaurant are great and people watching is also great
the food was very good i had a crab filled baby said which was very tasty my colleague had a grilled piece of halibut and he said but was also very good the waiter was good and the spanish manager was very friendly and helpful be careful if you use the bathroomstoiletsthe lighting is minimal and i am not sure if that is here as a design feature or to hide the dirt
we did not stay for the nightclub which when we left dinner had not even started yet, i have to say mint is really nice restaurant concept they have is fancy and impressive menu is wide if you cant find anything to eat blame is on your shoulders but the negative points go to waiters they arent very professional our waiter had language problem plus he did not know his work that well for example he never asked how we would like to have our stakes i will return for sure and i hope i have better luck with waiter, very cool room with a terrific view of the bund food was creative unique presentation and off the charts delicious, mint would have been extremely boring if we had not gone in a large group we had a good time since we purchased bottles at a table perhaps wednesday is not a big night to go out but we were in the middle of an almost empty club the shark tank is what makes this place awesome the building itself is great just empty during the week the number of obvious prostitutes strolling around looking for lair was a bit weird, one of my fav place in town love the music and the crowd

like how they have 2 different areal for different kind if music, after having spent a nice evening at various bars we went to this spot for a few more drinks and some nice music however as soon as we entered the club we were treated very rudely by the staff as our group consisted of three guys and one girl we were constantly observed by some black guardians as soon as we three guys were chatting and having a good time together we were suddenly separated by the guardians saying that guys should not come too close as this is a straight club i have never ever experienced something that even came close to such a shocking and inappropriate behaviour it seems as if at least some part of the staff is explicitly homophobic there is just one verdict we will never ever spend so much money at a club that is as homophobic as mint club shame on you, we ate in mint as we arrived in shanghia late in the evening and there were limited optionsso i had no idea what to expect on arrival i realised its also a night club the door staff were a bit over the top and kept us waiting to go in

the view from the restaurant is very impressive a good way to see the shanghia sky line at night the dinning area has a glitzy night club feel the food is very expensive i agree with other reviewers that it could be a lot better i didnt go into the nightclub i can see that you are after a glitzy nightclub eating here might make sense

on a positive note it is open late and the sky line is impressive the spanish restaurant manager was very polite and welcoming ashame there was not more of that

when we left we wanted to ask directions the door men were rude and aggressive a bit unnecessary, m1nt is a place to pass by when youre in town but i personally think that it is a bit overrated the sharks tank is impressing although saddening when you think of the poor sharks that are being exploited as a marketing tool stuck in a little tank
the staff is very nice and polite though the place extremely westernized and the music rather good if you have the necessary budget an expensive night there must be pretty fun, great view if you get a table seat near the window and food ok in the resturant service poor at the table and door cloakroom scary and off putting didnt try the club but looking at the clientele going in looks young and pretentious 

very expensive and you can definitely do better the only positive aspect was the spanish resturant manager he was polite and had the right idea shame about the rest of the place


would not return, great clubpolite staff and great coctailssharks are amazingvery handsome crowdmust visit in shanghai and definitely the best club in shanghai, all i can say is that you have to visit this place if you are up a for crazy night it will be a night to remember, if you like to explore citys on a fashion way you cant miss this place excellent restaurant mediterranean food french chef spanish meitre d good english speaking people nice ambient seems new york paris anywhere else than china very chic glam excellence decoration great service i just love it very quiet on tuesday they close at 11 pm the kitchen and the lounge around 130pm 24th floor you can see shanghai by night great views, i have been here a few times on work trips in shanghai  its always the highlight of my trip  the atmosphere is quirky and cool its dimly lit  has very unique eye catching decor with bold artworks and lots of texture in the furnishings the food has always been fantastic on my visits usually after a week of eating fairly unusual cuisine it is a welcome treat  the black cod is delicious im not sure if i was amazed by the shark tanks or just wanted to set them free but either way this is a place you wont forget fantastic breathtaking views of shanghai also terrible lighting to redo your make up haha i really recommend this place especially for groups dancing away in the bar with some drinks is a must do once you have finished your meal, super location good plates and drink
the music and the shake aquariums complete this fantastic place, a great view and a cool vibe set to overtake the better clubs you have been to with their immense layout of restaurant and bar a 20 meter shark tank and champagne galore

i have been to mint a few times and must say that the dining experience is not very good the food is ok but for a venue that sets the bar this high is a bit of a letdown it�s also extremely expensive and just doesn�t deliver overall

as a club the venue can be pretty wild late night the only issue is that the clean splendidness of this venue is lost to stupid and uncouth drunk people the case with all clubs i suppose the old team mgt have moved on also to a new venue which is a shame because it now further lacks some of the pump and luster that it used to have

the music is rubbish actually and for a club that if it could get it right would be of super club status quite frankly just doesnt cut it we met an english guy out the front with his porsche that was such a loser who turned out to be the resident dj furthermore his music taste was awful lol

so if you want to get drunk and go home with some random stranger whilst listening to shotty music then you will love this place however for me it�s not all that, very cool club located in the city centre
we had some problems int finding it since the address is no more tongren road but it is now located on the bund close to the river we booked a table for new years eve and we arrived terribly late on reservations time but the staff which is very fluent in english has been very cool and did not give away our table
food is very tasty the location is wonderful with a superbe view and the club is very cool
i recommend this place for sure, its been at least 2 years since ive been to mint and had excellent memories of my previous visit still incredibly polished with amazing views of the big city welcoming and attentive staff  yet the food quality fell vastly short the tuna tartare served at ambient temperature was incredibly bland the duck in fairness they had warned me that this wasnt their best dish certainly wasnt their best  the brulee just soso whilst mint provided a glamourous respite i felt duped that wed spent a lot of money on below par food, m1nt club and restaurant is almost an institution by now in shanghai we have regularly entertained guests friends and family there over the past two years the restaurant has very nice views over the shanghai night skyline with the pudong financial district in the background and the food is so good that makes all worth it
being a member you get priority in booking which is sometimes necessary and serves to get the best views but you dont have to be to enjoy the restaurant at its best
the menu is high class and some dishes are all time classics that we keep ordering octopus terrine and beef carpaccio are the best in shanghai so are the wagyu beef steaks and fillets must try main is the bamboo roasted pacific black cod and the rangers valley beef sirloin
the service is superb and the staff are very good in helping you choose accompanying wines from the extensive list cocktails to start are well prepared and timing between dishes is always perfect to enjoy the ambience but do explain if you are in a hurry as it can be a while to reach desserts
obviously price wise m1nt is very expensive and there are only a handful more expensive restaurants in shanghai which is already an expensive city to dine in so the value for money is low but not excessively so and for the type of clientele the m1nt is looking for it can be a good
choice note that after 89 pm the adjoining bar and lounge are becoming busy and it gets really noisy and sometimes that makes all the diners raise their voice which means this is not a romantic environment but it is elegant and is well suited for business dinners
the club is also available after dinner and its a great bar scene but note that smoking in the bar maybe not be suited to everyones tastes, without a doubt one of the finest restaurants in shanghai weve eaten at mint numerous times over the past couple years while were no longer members we continue to enjoy the restaurant the food is consistently excellent and the steaks are without peer it gets a bit loud after 9 pm when the adjoining club heats up and whether youre in the dining room lounge or dance floor the view of downtown shanghai is gorgeous, food is not qualify because from order to serve pass just few minutes different customers different time delivery
our salad and fish serve on same time 5 minutes from orderyou can image 
service staff is not concentrated on his duty need ask always for fill the glass
i prefer next just go during busy time late night","Italian cuisine",0.999793377990253
126,"this was recommended by the concierge at our hotel to fit our brief of good chinese food and a view of the bund he certainly came through for us by recommending this restaurant  it was fantastic the food was really good service exceptional and the view was really wonderful i will be back when i return to shanghai, every holiday we have a splurge once and this was it for 2017
the surroundings are very oppulent staff perfectly attired tables and seats top quality
staff attention to detail superb and no problems with english
okay so to the food everything we ordered was well prepared and very tasty the peking duck was served in the traditional way with crepes and cucumber with a dash of the sauce it was mouth watering big shock was the price of this one dish so i suggest if you need to justify it share it among many and then convert the cost back to your home currency remember it is the experience not the cost which is superb, we went for having dinner it was delicious food nice service while dining you have a perfect view over the bond with pearltower etc

after dinner it is also great to have a drink in the old man jazz bar in the ground level of the hotel
perfect evening, i ate here three times the soup dumplings are wonderful the peking duck is amazing just go and eat youll love it, the peking duck was amazing i hear it is not as good as in beijing but we loved it if you want the duck make sure you order once you are seated as it can take some time and they need to make sure it is available, this is one of the most pleasant places to dine on the bund the peace hotel is historic and beautiful the dragon and phoenix has exquisitely prepared traditional chinese items with outstanding staff and service in a beautiful setting expensive but for many visitors it will be worth it, the food was very good and reasonably priced we had peking duck as well as their seasonal prix fixed selections we liked it so much we ate there every chance we got we stayed at the fairmont which is recently restored to its historic grandeur the restaurant was a pleasant surprisewe went for the view but loved the service, we found the service to be very attentive the food was excellent and the view of the bund was exceptional all in a very historic location we would certainly go again, it is hard to separate the food from the beautiful building this restaurant is located in we had very good authentic shanghai meals at a window overlooking the bund great fish and prawns with lovely service then caught some jazz in the bar downstairs a very fine evening that was appreciated, located inside the peace hotel in the bund this is a gorgeously renovated art deco restaurant the food is chinese and very reasonably priced for the location the service was friendly and helpful and if youre lucky youll get a table next to the window looking across the river to shanghais famous skyline, i arrived around 530 and since i didnt have a booking i was given a table near the front door however i saw if you are a westerner and argue with them they will try and accommodate you to get a window seat since i wanted to try the mitten crab i got their package menu but in hindsight should have ordered individual dishes the mitten crabs they use is really small and the main dish is not the traditional preparation method the plus side is the waiter and waitress was very accommodating and attentive overall it was nice to eat at such a historical restaurant, we had the tasting menu at this lovely restaurant it was absolutely delicious the service was excellent and the views of shanghai at night were wonderful, the restaurant was recommended by a friend it was supposed to be good as it was at an iconic landmark peace hotel by the bund

i checked the menu and price was alright so i booked there with my family

1 all staff apart from a male manager were not helpful

2 food price was alright but drink was outrageously expensive water from tap will cost you rmb 10

3 waited 15mins for my water

4 food was served from various location of the round table the classic was a waitress trying to serve a hot dish above the head of my 3yr old boy

5 food was only normal

in sum avoid this place you can get much better food service and view of the bund in the area, ive been to this restaurant quite a few times over the years firstly the peace hotel is a wonderful hotel to see inside of even if you dont go to the restaurant you should look at this excellent example of art deco architecture

secondly the view from this restaurant of the bund and of the other side of the river is excellent

thirdly the food is good broad menu of shanghai and cantonese cooking very good service, a tipical chinese restaurant with a rich and various menu furnishings aligned with chinese tradition but the best option is the stunning view on the river with the financial city illuminated at night very impressive, we opted for the fixed menu which gave a good variety of dishes seems a mix of local business dinners and those in for a special night good offering of wine and a la carte menu if you choose not to eat off the prix fixe nice restored decor, my husband and i had dinner at this restaurant and ordered three dishes all shanghai local dishes one of them with tofu and the tofu was spoiled one dish was not anywhere close to the taste of that shanghai dish probably because this restaurant is specialize guang dongcanton dishes one dish tasted okay for the price we paid we could have had much better food elsewhere with great view of the huangpu riverpudong as well, loved the atmosphere the staff were very attentive and the to food was excellent all in all this made for a very relaxing dining experience with authentic chinese cuisine we were lucky to have a seat looking out over the bund and as the night fell the scenery changed by the minute
we would have no worries about recommending this to others
well done, i dinned here with my wife and we ordered traditional food and it was mostly quite good service was excellent and the view was excellent also price was pretty good considering the location, excellent restaurant at the fairmont peace hotel
very good food excellent wine card and extremely friendly staff thank you alex for the good advices 
some dishes are very typical and might not
suit the european taste  so do not hesitate to ask for advice  the staff will be pleased to help you make your choice 
and ask for a window table the view is spectacular , the maitre d asked if i was sure that i wanted to order the shanghai menu specialties of preserved shrunken chicken shanghai style and wok fried eel traditional shanghai style since most westerners ie those with caucasian features didnt usually venture to order these items i assured him i wanted to try them and i am glad that we did  they were the best dishes on our table the restaurant is upscale which you pay for but the food is quite good and dont fail to walk around the beautiful peace hotel after dinner  it has been beautifully renovated since i was last there a few decades ago, first of all the place of the restaurant is super right in the heart of the bund and you could see through the complete bund view of the window the food is also with high quality we order the duck dish which is the one of the most recommended it is very nice dish highly recommended the price is on high end 5 adults 1 child 16 k rmb, the restaurant has aspirations to be a bit luxury and the decorations are very much chinese heavy the food is presented in a modern cuisine way and looks very nice but the taste is traditional chinese without much seasoning service was very good and we had a nice view, we absolutely love this hotel even got married it in last year the jazz bar cathay room hotel itself and the history  amazing so was expecting great things from the dragon phoenix however it was pretty disappointing

first after ordering we were told one of our starters were sold out so we asked for a similarly recommendation we were highly recommended a main course  sweet  sour fish we took it as 1 its a recommendation and we thought it was similar portion and 2 we had asked if we had ordered too much the food came in a timely manner but it was waaaay too much the fish was the killer he told us a few pieces of fish meat was in fact the entire fish when the bill came we noticed the price of this unnecessary fish was 4 times more expensive than our originally sold out starter

then came another waiter who asked if we wanted another glass of champagne we said no we would like a beer the waiter think he was a manager as he was in suit different from our first waiters uniform told my husband ill top you up with a little champagne before i get you the beer so we agreed then he gave us a full glass we thought this was strange as we had said no to another glass so was assuming he literally was just topping up a little as i hadnt finished my glass yet however we noticed it was the end of a champagne bottle and was guessing whether we would be charged for it it was also our wedding anniversary which we told them when making the reservation so thought perhaps it was complimentary

of course we had been charged for this it was so sneaky we realised that it was the end of the night they had one glass left in the bottle so they gave it to us

third disappointment was the tea the teapot was tiny cute and yes serious tea drinkers use such tiny pots and cups however at 58rmb a person i expected a little more like a water refill the teapot was so tiny it was three mouthfuls tops there was a confusion when i asked for more water they gave me lemon water then she saw the confusion on my face and brought the tea back however the tea had changed i actually think they brought me someone elses tea cos the taste was bland like someones refill was waiting to see if we were charged for another pot of tea too we werent

anyway the whole experience was a bit disappointing for such an amazing venue the food and service was not good at all you can get better food in shanghai people say its for the view but again not worth it usually we never complain about price because we know food cost is high but being blatantly upsold was really annoying and we felt cheated not a great feeling when youre celebrating, i am not a fan of the gaudy decor the standard of the food is inconsistent but the saving grace is the peking duck it is one of the best i ever had, if you splash out once in shanghai make it here you will come away with an amazing food experience and a travel story to tell your friends faithfully restored to its pomp the decor is lush transporting you back in time to another shanghaithe food is fabulous been there three times will go there againand yes i paid, whilst it has a good reputation and views across the bund the overall experience was somewhat disappointing

whilst we didnt expect all our food order to arrive westernstyle ie starters together then main course together we did expect it to arrive in a reasonable time unfortunately not  we ended up waiting between every small dish and eventually gave up as the noodles didnt arrive until we were finished and ready to pay the bill also and again whilst we did not want westernstyle chinese food some attention to the quality would have been good or at least better suggestions made by the staff for example the chicken dish we ordered was so full of fat gristle and bone that it was inedible, being shanghainese i love my city and its cuisine after living abroad for so many years this restaurant really has awaken some of my old taste memory after 12 days in shanghai and numerous restaurant expeierence this as the last dinner really left me with a sentimental feeling

it is set in a beautifully resorted historical hotel probably the best known the service is superb and there is a large selection of traditional shanghainese dishes done to perfection the view of pudong financial district is superb remember to book a table with a view, we came to this restaurant mother and daughter we ordered goose slices and a fish they were both immaculate unfortunately i expected a pigeon on the menu but it was unavailable it was surprising, we had just arrived at the fairmont and so enjoyed being able to have dinner at the hotel we were well looked after and the food was lovely, loved the cuisine at the phoenix dragon  and ordered many items to our room the panseared shanghaistyle pork buns are out of this world, wonderful food amazing views informative wait staff that told us interesting stories about the area gave us recommendations on where to go and insights into the area the food was beautifully prepared and they accommodated my need for gluten free flawlessly, beautiful view of the bund river and modern shanghai skyline lit by a myriad of lights including several boats, the standout feature of this restaurant is the magnificent views over the bund it is located on the 7th floor of the fairmont peace hotel the decor is soft and there is plenty of room between the tables to enable intimate conversation

we had a banquet which consisted of about nine courses these ranged from lemon chicken sweet and sour pork spring rolls vegetables mushrooms etc clearly very fresh produce used and the various flavours complimented one another after almost three weeks in china eating a variety of chinese meals this was a very welcome relief as the dishes tastes and quality were all very similar to chinese meals at good restaurants in australia

service levels very high although english was only slightly understood

alcohol very expensive but then again so it is all through china average bottle of an ordinary red about $150

if staying in shanghai either at the peace fairmont or somewhere else i thoroughly recommend this restaurant, would i go again yes
ups excellent shanghai food bund location
downs pricey

dragon phoenix is located at 8th floor of peace hotel directly at shanghai bund the interior is classical chinese but light and sophisticated the service attentive and with english abilities
the cuisine is classical shanghainese cooking but also beijing duck is available on half day preorder and been celebrated on table with artistic skills
the rest is delicious rice noodles with shrimps roasted duck shrimps and cashews all very well prepared wine ist is fine and in shngahai price level a bottle nice australian chardonnay in 499 rmb
pricing wise dont expect a bargain 4050 usd per person if you want to enjoy, the best meal that i have ever had shanghai spicy shrimp attentive staff excellent view shanghai silk dresses beautiful historic hotel peaceful soft jazz so you can enjoy it all go upstairs one floor for a drink after dinner, i didnt eat here but i visited the room for architectural interest this is a spectacular chinese art deco room from 1929 which has been restored and preserved if you visit the hotel this is a must see and photos are permitted, great chinese food and very authentic thoroughly enjoyed shanghai food and its authenticity lovely service and attentive staff, i wanted to have a meal at the fairmont peace hotel because of the history of the hotel itself this is the most wonderful old dinning room that is heritage protected right down to the brass heating vents on the walls and the beautiful painted ceiling plus you have the fabulous view over the bund and the river  we had shredded duck with bean shoots and peppers seasonal greens and a serving of pan fried dumplings  sheng jian bao  with some beer and white tea the food was delicious the service impeccable  my tea was served in a beautiful teapot with larger clear pot on heat ready to refill, if you are staying in shanghai and looking for a good traditional chinese restaurant you just have to try this place nice deco and good food service nothing to shout about but this is shanghai just remember all the big cities in china does not have good service, perhaps the only thing worth mentioning at this restaurant is its view of the bund food quality sadly is appalling we just ordered a few simple dishes for dinner sea cucumber with vinegar was hard as ice fried diced chicken was lukewarm with overcooked texture sauteed pea sprouts came with long thick stalks that are barely chewable finally there were scraps of bone in the wonton filing

kitchen staff were sleep walking, breakfast was varied and plentiful dinner was upscale gourmet chinese food the mandarin river fish in sweet and sour sauce was unreal overall a real treat, the room is gorgeous the view spectacular and the breakfast delicious the service was great a delightful experience, one of the restaurants with the best quality chinese kitchen i do know the restaurant has a wide selection of dishes from harmless to quite exotic its an excellent restaurant to bring non chinese people to make their first experience with chinese kitchen the quality of the food and the taste is outstanding we have taken guests already many times to this restaurant and everybody wants to go their again at their next visit the staff is very experienced and the deco and atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice the only negative point is the continues fight for a table at the windows nice look at pudong even if all tables are empty they always try to place you at the inside of the restaurant prices are a little higher but absolutely fair we will go there many more times, traditional shanghai menu with excellent quality love this place for meeting with a larger number of people 6 to 8 staff are very friendly and make very good recommendations, we had a large group for dinner of course we had our local hosts ordering for us everything was great i cant name everything we tried but we found all dishes tasty and wellpresented we had a fabulous lobster dish bean curd beef fish everything was great afterwards we one floor up to a roof top looking out over the bund amazing view, spread of food limited for breakfast selection is not fantastic do not particularly enjoy the breakfast, this is a great location and the food is marvelous call ahead and get a table by the window for lunch or dinner it is a fabulous view over the bund service was excellent and the selection of dishes was very good not inexpensive but well worth it for the ambiance and view, lots of options lots of local options with many familiar options as well for a westerner

fantastic views and expresso drinks are included, this restaurant is situated in the peace hotel and has magical views of the bund and beyond especially on a clear night it is way upmarket from the time i first visited it in 1983 the staff were attentive and well trained the food was good however felt it was on the expensive side especially the wine the decor was old world chinese and has been beautifully restored ","bar",0.999716041752192
127,"very good restaurant highly recommended nice staff delicious food we order brawn biryani  chicken biryani  mixed yoghurt  carry masala, friends had spoken in glowing terms about the sunday brunch at kebabs on the grille so we decided to give it a try the brunch is served from 1130 to 1600 and we arrived at 1430 we had expected table service and that was indeed available a lacarte but the brunch was actually a buffet that had been prepared a few hours ago there was a wide range of food including fish chicken mutton prawns vegetables and biryanis however with the exception of a few dishes we found the taste of most dishes just passable the presentation was poor perhaps because diners had been eating there for the past few hours and no effort had been made to keep the serving dishes clean of spilled food in retrospect we were left wondering if we would have been much happier if we had ordered a lacarte, one of the best indian restaurants in shanghai been here multiple times and even ordered for delivery the service is very good and food is excellent, title really says it all but have to mention a few specifics the boti mutton is possibly the best lambmutton dish ive ever had the spicing the cook on the meat absolutely first class the mutton korma however while excellent was not a korma to my mind it reminded me more of a gosht kata masala with that fairly spicy dry aftertaste but certainly nothing like a korma to be honest i should have said something but i was being british and didnt want to make a fuss the service was nice to begin with but didnt get a second look from the staff once wed paid normally i wouldnt care either way but indian restaurants usually make a big deal of thanking you for your custom etc for three people no drinks we paid 390rmb, mixted feeling  everything grilled  kebab nan etc very good fully home made and tasty lentles and cottage cheese good while being a bit missing taste and then come the curry which was for me average good service but over all quite pricy 420 rmb for lunch for 2 persons  25 rmb each nan  over all we would probably come back but then go only for grilled dishes, the food is good close to what you get in india the place was over crowded because of a big group of tourists other than that everything was perfect, lovely restaurant in shanghai we ordered dahl makhani palak paneer aloo gobi jeera rice garlic naan rashmi kebab and traditional lemon soda the meal came with complimentary onion pickle and mint chutney plenty of food for four of us couldnt fault the dishes tasty and authentic and a atmosphere as well we left with empty plates full bellies and would definitely recommend to others, decent indian restaurant popular amongst western tourists cant go wrong if you are a vegetarian just ask the friendly staff who would be happy to rustle up to your requirements veg kadai with man bread was fantastic the cool docks also has live jazz band artists performing excellent ambient atmosphere just a few minutes walk from the bund thoroughly recommend this restaurant, food was pretty good in a really nice setting at the cool docks restaurant is not too flash but passable worth a try especially, much better management than before but still the curries are ruined by poor quality meat lots of fat on red meat and no breast meat in chicken dishes, really delicious and amazing food the atmosphere is also amazing a bit pricey but would recommend as i tasted one of the best indian dishes, excellent location at the cool docks amazing ambience good food  great personalized service ask for anything and be assured it will be done the kebabs are very tasty especially the fish lasooni, went there as part of a family group for lunch the food was exceptional for a foreign land and i would say even good if it was served back home the ambiance is very nice and it is located very close to the nanjing road i come to shanghai often i shall return, located in food court inside cool docks this restaurant serves authentic indian cuisine their paneer toka is excellent and worth a try their deserts are average but main courses are really nice, the place is well located the service is good the food is very much indian and very appealing and tasty, i normally go to this place at least a couple of times when i visit shanghai they are pretty decent guys with quality food  nothing to complaint i normally take to go food but i heard sunday lunch buffet is also good, we visited this restaurant following a recommendation in the china lonely planet guide although a little more expensive than your local eateries we really fancied indian food and it was well worth it you definitely have your moneys worth in terms of the amount of food you get and it was nice to sit outside in the cool docks square i would definitely recommend if you fancy indian flavours whilst in china and can suggest the tikka masala onion bahjiis and samosas, best food i ve eaten in china so far dal makhani is better than most places in pune mumbai service is great awesome location and ambience  superb, we went to this restaurant for the sunday brunch buffett and the food was delicious really good value for money and really good service with bottomless drinks and all you can eat it definitely is worth the visit , really enjoyed the food and the ambience round the water of the cool docks excellent service too

try the reshmi kebabs, we meet again after 4 years must go there if you are visiting shanghaithey have 45 branches food is very nice and tasty, i went to this restaurant last week service is ok curry was made with lots of spices very tasty also the grilled chicken was very nice the chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was fresh and rich, nice indian restaurant with delicious food and great ambiencenice courteous staffat various places in shanghai, amazing experience here friendly staff beautiful food so much to choose from i cannot wait to go back and try the sunday buffet too that really is going to be a true treat cannot fault this place at all, went for dinner at this restaurant the evening we landed in shanghai a very good choice

location is great  close to the bund at a place called cool docks an huge courtyard with a pond in the center with live music and various eating places all around in patios as well as indoors

we sat outdoors the ambience and environment was very good

ordered a bottle of malt of which they just had one  and that too an opened one we had to do a bit of amicable negotiation which was quickly resolved

the food was very good unlike some indian restaurants the spices were just right and not overbearing at all

serving were substantial and sumptuous

if you are looking for good indian food in shanghai this the place to go, overall  a great indian restaurant in sh
great tastes most importantly every dishes tastes authentic indian

 they also have a branch near ppl square and thats where i went

staff is so nice oh and did i mention that they also offer fapiao p you just spell the name of your company danwei p in pinyin and there you go 

oh btw  they close quite early the ppl square branch im talking aboutmake sure to order before 10 i guess last time it was such a rush for us see the staff cleaning up, the curries had intense and complex flavors thats how i like my vindaloo and masala bbq chicken was tasty and juicy their naan was hot and crispy one of my favorite indian in shanghai, kabab was served cold and was definitely not from grillnot an apt name for restaurantasked for replacement and waiter was arguing with me that kabab was freshly made sometime back, went on a saturday night with colleagues but lots of wine sold out food however made up for itlovely curries fragrant rice and very fresh nans amazing surroundings of cool docks topped off our night, spent many of my afternoons eating here
buffets on alternate days in the afternoons are value for money

vegetable biryani is something to try specially for veggies out there its pretty hard to find good veggie food in shanghai, loved the buffet menu with beer and wine between 124 great chilean white goes well with all the curries service was good and a good place to take a chinese friend who has never eaten indian he loved it too, went on a sunday and they offer a curry buffet along with free flow drinks alcoholic and non good value at 150 rmb curry good but not great side dishes were delicious, we visited this place on 27 august for dinner the fiod was not very tempting and quantity was very less you can try masala art in shanghai nice place, visited quite a few timesloved the food a must try dal makhani paranthas saag chicken and dal halwa offers decent variety of starters friendly staff i believe best dal makhani in shanghai, here is the story with this placeit is located in a nice area next to other cool restaurants when you first enter the restaurant if they are busy you will stand there for about 2 minutes before the greet you the menu has good options for both vegeterian and non vegeterian customers the food is decent but not the greatest other indian restaurants in shanghai offer better quality of food bigger portion at a better pricei recommend sitting outside as you will have a nice view and clothes wont smell like indian food afterwards, ive been here several times this place never disappoints great tasting food and good service if you want a really hot curry you must hammer the point home quite abit, i have visited this restaurant in the month of july and its a good restaurant for indian food and rates are not too costly and u also find jain food without onion and garlic  all staffs are indian and u feels homely atmosphere, very good food and excellent value lunch sets really enjoyed it and will make a point to visit again soon, the indian food here was very good and get value for a lunch set menu the chicken was excellent and the chick peas even better the service was a little slow but this was not an issue for us as we were not in a great hurryand when the food arrived it was fresh and tasty, really good authentic middle eastern food try the homemade naan bread which can be also with cheese and other additions halal meat for our muslim friends the only thing you should have in mind is that it is a bit more expensive for the quality offered, we ate buffet dinner as part of group tour ambiance is very good quality of food was very good overall a very good place to eat indian food in shanghai close to metro station  you can walk to nanjing street  15 minutes, was there for lunch good food busy with lot of guests great place to eat make sure you get a table before hand as it is located in a busy place and has a lot of locals eating there too, we had a buffet at this restaurant the food was spicy but not overpowering didnt have any dessert choice overall a good place to try indian food, i love the spicy food so this was a good catch and combined with draft beer things got really intense kkkkk
i definetly recomend this, the ambiace and location is superb commonly known as cool dock there are many other cuisine restaurants

food is very good they have outdoor sitting as well and ambiance out door with water bodies is very well decorated

to get a taxi for going backnis little difficult you end up paying more since nobody ready to take you by meter taxi, first went to kebabs on the grille in 2010 and have been coming back pretty much at least once a month since then to the cool docks location admittedly i almost always order the same things but they make a great chicken tikka masala, it was my repeat visit to this place after gap of approximate 2 years
its situated on cool docks a great food place where you can find cuisine of all over the world
food taste is good not 100 authentic indian but very near service is good it have indoor as well as outdoor sitting
its nice place and worth visiting, this restaurant is located in a new upcomin neighbourhood when sunny you can sit outside the foood is delicious and the service fast we recommend, i think by rating this restaurant 4 then i make a good average of our experience the food itself is worth 5 as what was served to us was really good i went there for sunday brunch which is very affordable at 150 rmb including soft drinks and beer i also went there part of a business dinner 2 weeks before that on both occasion we were very satisfied with the taste and the quality of the food now comes the service which i would give max 3 the whole meal went on without a smile and especially from the managerowner i would have expected much better from this restaurant
the location is very good in the new trendy cool docks area quite difficult to get a taxi after the meal though, i wonder if you should go or avoid it when the review says not bad i suspect it means if you absolutely cant think of anywhere else to go and you have a gang of your office mates limping behind you its the place to be
the entrance in tucked away in a corner of this shopping mall behind bright lights and cascading fountains the mall is not well sign posted so you could easily miss it
it is part of a chain and feels like it there is very little that is distinctive about the decor or the menu we were surrounded by what appeared to be company diners  tables of 12 to 15 people having a good time the upper floor was full and the waiters kept the beer and dishes flowing basically the food is not bad there i said it we had a selection of starters chicken and fish tikka we then moved onto the main dishes lamb rogan josh and some other mains all fairly tasty but again without distinction the kulfi was ok and we left not unhappy but thinking that next time well have to plan something else","steakhouse",0.99983110031689
128,"this restaurant is very busy and quick service there seems to be many people waiting but seated very quick
food is great and i definitely recommend the sticky ribs we ordered a couple of times as i feel we eat much more than the chinese dont look at the outside as it looks a bit shabby go inside and give it a try, a quite good and very popular chinese chain concept ordering is difficult unless you have a chinese friend with you although many of the grandma<u+00b4>s do have a menu with pictures and english text people are lining up for these restaurants and you will normally have to wait a little bit to get in, if you are looking for delicious chinese food and a great environment for a good price this is a place they have a wide variety of food but their english menu is not complete so you should look at the chinese one the environment is also great as well as the service it is great for group meals where you can share your food and try different plates for about 35 rmb per person a beer costs 15 rmb but you can take your own drinks to the restaurant too for example i saw a chinese couple bringing a bottle of wine from home
ask for the grilled eggplant and the sweet pork, all of the food we got was really good but they were out of a few things we wanted they were even out of tsingdao beer a neighboring table had had a bunch of tsingdao already and acted really mad when they couldnt get more but for some reason this branch was really out of a lot of their popular dishes this was late on a sunday night despite that the food really was good we had roasted pork belly bacon golden mushrooms mango gelato panfried potatoes because they were out of the small whole roasted ones and roasted eggplant, it was a long wait on a friday night i think its the same at most branches we waited for about 30 min for a table of 7 once the waiter took our orders our food was served very quickly however as the restaurant was packed the waiters and waitress took a longer time to bring us our drinks

we ordered more than 7 dishes excluding desserts and it only cost <u+00a5>400 our favourite was the grandmas chicken as the meat was tender and marinated well i would strongly recommend this dish as a musttry

theres a wide variety of dishes and suit young children

however the menu is all in chinese and will be quite tough for those who cant read the characters the branch i visited 2 years ago in hangzhou had a magazine styled menu which this branch doesnt have, this restaurant looked lovely had all the right pics in the menu and a lazy susan but for a big group it was not ideal the food came way too slowly and was only average not high on my list, but the waiters were very rude and queue took too much time however the food was good came in fast and tasted good, ive no idea about this res first just lost and get insideits tasty and be my localamazing foods now love max, it was located 7th floor something different they have their own elevator waited just 10 minutes to get a table confused on the menus as they offered dozens on dishes ordered 7 dishes but one i really love it fish head noodles personally i do not like to eat fish but amazingly this fish taste so so so nice it was so juicy really enjoyed this dish nice place nice food reasonable for food just that they do not accept foreign credit card for payment luckily we brought enough cash for this as usually i only pay through credit cards one more thing we were there around 840pm and they started cleaning the tables and here goes all the noise on throwing the plates cups spoonsetc was abit frustrated on the noise anyway good food for overall, eating chinese food at grandmass is a waranty
the food is delicious and ill be for sure back there for my next visit in shanghai
amazingggg, delicious and various selection of food for great price menu also in english without pictures but you could manage nice interier crowded with locals and foreigners that manage to find it you might need a reservation, i went here when staying with friends who are locals we only got a table on the third attempt as it was absolutely packed and we were 14th in line for a table on one of the other nights i can totally see why its so popular though when we eventually did get in the food was absolutely delicious and quite ridiculously cheap my friend and i shared about 5 plates and left full for only 85 yuan really nice atmosphere too the menu isnt available in english though so if i hadnt been with a local id have had no idea also the service wasnt up to the standard of the food  they didnt have 2 dishes but didnt think to tell us i found it quite entertaining that one of the dishes theyd run out of was boiled rice still gets 5 stars due to the fantastic food everything they do they do really well even just basic pak choi was delicious, third time we eat in this restaurant once in beijing and once in hangzhou and we are not disappointed the food is good and the prices are reasonable, news flash the grandmas now has an englishmenu yes you will still probably run into some confusion at this restaurant without chineselanguage skills but its now much easier restaurant is on the 7th floor of a mall its modern with a pleasing somewhatupscale decor food is good for shanghai i didnt find every dish to be great but some certainly were try the scallops you have to order each garlic scallop individually but theyre only about us$150 so go for it the fried beef was also very good we would the grandmas to offer very good value a nicelunch cost about us$10 per person, is one of the best shanghainese style restaurant very very typical good food pay attention the menu is in chinese without images if you are foreigner youll need a translator to understand but im lucky i have my local colleagues , if you have someone with you who speaks chinese or pictures of what you had before and liked it is a great place we had ample food and beer and left with paying under 60 rmb each  thatll never be the case at any place where they have an english menu, very nice chinese food everything tastes good no dish has disappoint me so far the only downside is that they do not have english menu nor any menu with picture on it we always rely on a chinese friend to help us in ordering the food nonetheless grandmas is always nice for a big group dinner because we can order many different dishes and share everything, whilst there is a small but interesting menu in english the chinese character menu is much more larger feeling brave we ordered off the chinese character menu using the recommendations and chilli ratings as a guide 8 fantastic dishes later for less than <u+00a3>30 including drinks a real bargain and will definitely be back on this trip and future trips here well done granny on a great menu and relaxing setting, the food is not bad taste of the dishes are good but the hygiene is bad although the dishes are cheap and the restaurant decor itself looks fine service is bad, clean efficient service reasonably priced and tasty

menu selection good and should satisfy most palettes

definitely revisit on our next visit to shanghai, best qualityprice ratio you can find in shanghai  we have been visiting this restaurant many times food is good and super cheap the only problem is that staff does not speak englishand only few english menu are available but it is worth the wait , we were taken here by our tour guide place is really busy at 130pm but the place is huge and maze like food is good tour guide did the ordering tea was kind of bizzare there is a giant vat in the corridor and you fill up with tea there no teapot at the table you have to get up to get a refill, without fancy designjust like grandmas big house with wood chairs and tablesyou can have some really good chinese food here with a very reasonable priceone of my favorite restaurantlucky you can find it in many cities in china","Japanese cuisine",0.999520369298393
129,"sat at the kitchen bar and watched chefs prepare creative tasty food with flair and outstanding wines by the glass, decided to have take away dessert here order the candy apple mousse the cake was nice yet the mousse inside the cake was super yummy a slice of cake will cost you between 5060ish rmb but price paid quality it was indeed one of dessert that remains remarkable in my heart, lateliers concept either you like it either you do not but in both cases service is great and very friendly it shows staff enjoy working at latelier and that they are proud to be part of a fine diner experience dishes are lovely to see and even better to eat if you are looking for a high quality diner book at latelier on the bund, while the prices were quite high the quality of the pastries were delicious there was an ample array of macaroons and other desserts the flavor of the macaroons were top tier this is an ideal stop if walking along the street or the bund it has a small sitting area for patrons to view the street traffic and public, heard that macau robuchon chief moved to shanghai robuchon as robuchon fans we must try the restaurant when we visit different places after we settled at the restaurant we double checked with the waitress to ensure that chief came from macau however she said the chief was off today although he was absent today we were still looking forward to dine there however all signature dishes were below average we thought one of the reason might be the food sources and origins but the other chiefs cook also affected the meal and the heater is too warm which made us dont want to stay sad that its our prevalentines meal, the food is excellent the service as well
all courses are a small piece of art not only how it looks also the way it taste
they do everything they can to give their guests a lovely evening
they even remembered the wine i was drinking the last time while that was some months ago
we love to sit at the bar it is great to see how they prepare the food this makes it more special, when one visits a restaurant like this the minimum that can be expected is that the service is at the level of the prices commanded

the only way i can describe the service here is disappointing and subpar

to start with we got a call from the restaurant the previous day telling us the table they ha driven us was next to the kitchen and asking if we would like a better one the caveat we had to postpone the dinner for half an hour to 2130

to make a long story short we accepted and found out during main course that we had been seated next to the bar and hence the smoking area

nobody cared that our dinner experience had been utterly ruined and even after we complained there were further people coming to smoke there

excuses were presented but again this is really inappropriate amateurish at best service totally unfitting for a supposed world class restaurant the food becomes nearly irrelevant, very nice location on 18 on the bund
food was quite good service nice quite full tonight lobster was massive all dishes were well executed despite being a little too warm
but worth it place to go for special occasion, i already have been in 1 2 and 3 michelin stars all over the world and really the latelier system dont desserve 2 stars if you are sitting in a bar chair at the counter you are not in a star restaurant people cannot serve you correctly with the necessary class you will expect in such a restaurant the waitresses are serving you over the counter i am sorry but for me it is just a big marketing business and no more the high gastronomy you can expect from a 2 stars moreover how can you expect the personal touch of a big chef while the business has more than 10 restaurants in the world, we reserved by phone a table not on the bar
it was not possible we had to eat at the bar the way how they told us where to eat was so much arrogant sorry this is not gastronomy, this venue just opened in spring 2016 and is located on the famous shanghai bund with my spouse we went there for dinner to celebrate an anniversary and got a table in the lounge area with view on pudong we chose one signature and one gastronomic menus food is very good but i wasnt able to appreciate fully as im not used to have so many mixed flavors in my mouth this is why i think signature menu was better and simpler not need to worry about quantity service is good but i was expecting better finally there are some downsides eating in the lounge area on sofa chair is not great if youre tall and if you dont want cigarette smell after 10pm overall we enjoyed our evening and we are planning to try a la carte for our next visit, every morsel of food and amazing taste and the presentation was great the guests around us were taking photos of every course and the service was perfect, just to say on the start it is not easy to get there taking in consideration that it is not a regular restaurant but more like a high end tapas bar with selection of main course offered who needs main course when they have petit plats your chance to try a lot of food and even more price you are at robuchon so get ready to spend premium money between two of us had 12 plates to share presentation is ok nothing compare to macao but flavors are excellent great experience great food service is excellent although were sitting at the bar pricy yes can get better value for money spent but good experience desserts are not at the level of food lower standards just me i guess, at the end of the night it was worth the money a really top meal and dining experience more of a conversation than just a meal i am not a great eater of desserts but the citron was a showstopper fabulous shanghai views lovely staff and top food, we visited the restaurant in october for my husbands birthday we were seated at the counter overlooking the open kitchen it seems that only tables of 4 or 5 persons would be able to request for a regular table there are only a couple of regular tables around

service didnt start off as well as i hoped  the wait staff didnt offer a drink menulist but asked what we wanted to drink they dont really have a nice selection of beers too but we settled for cocktails in the end which was fine

luckily the service was back on track after that episode and the service was really delightful food was excellent especially the amuse bouche i dont think one could do any wrong with any of their dishes one could take the tasting menu which would allow one to taste most of the dishes on their menu but it is rather expensive

overall the prices at the restaurant are high but it is really worth very cent would visit again for another occasion dinner, prices are very high but justified service is excellent and food is even better five star all the way absolutely no let downs, i have been to their london restaurant a few times was slightly fed up with chinese cooking and wanted a first class meal got it i have never been even the slightest disappointed with robuchon the meals and service here is out of this world every time i pay the bill at robuchon i state honestly i really cannot afford to eat here and i look forward to coming agan, worth to enjoy in china the best of french cuisine
everywhere joel robuchon makes it very successfully, visited this relatively new establishment in shanghai when i was having a short stay there in september and when i visited the place i was told they just received 2 stars from the michelin guide

food quality is consistent with all the robuchons i have visited and to me it represented some of the highest quality of french food you can get in this city service was very attentive and friendly waiters and waitresses can make good recommendations

there are many french restaurants in this modern city but many are still not at a this standard no matter food quality or services, we went to the salon de the joel robuchon on ground level of the bund 18 the restaurants tables were far too close to each others even the couple sitting next to us were trying hard to lower their voice volume it was kind of disturbing after 10 minutes we requested to move to the only available corner table and we felt much more comfortable

afternoon tea set for two was priced at rmb 488  almost the same as hk prices good selection of scones canapes and cakes food presentation was great and taste was excellent  great service from the male server  did not get his name i still prefer the latelier de joel robuchon in singapore , we had high expectations and we are familiar with cuisine at this level it was better than terrific we did not eat the set menu but chose our menu items exceptional food presentations and service quality we sat at the food bar and had the best bread basket ever, thanks guys for the night
we arrived late and 6 of us  starving on sunday night  we have only 6 bottles of wine  the sous chef charles help us to choose the food  it was just fantastic but too much 

my advice do not touch the bread it is just too good and your stomach will explode
the main course we choose the roasted chicken
amazing

nothing else to say 

the sommelier tristan gave us perfect recommandation

thanks for all staff mr robuchon is still my favorite place in shanghai

the price are great for the quality 

good job

regards
alexandre, food was great but i didnt feel there was the same sense of detail and research that i have experienced at robuchons other restaurants around the world something was lacking now for china this is an outstanding place
service was friendly and professional great choice of wines perfectly served
michelin just awarded 2 stars appropriate, i am very particular with food especially when it comes to michelinstarred restaurants i would say its an absolutely splendid dinner especially the staff is attentive to each diners needs we also felt the warmth of the team when they chatted happily with us the signature dishes like foie gras with steak and crab meat with caviar had caught our attention the presentation is remarkably out of this world and you can only comment it as flawless the dinner set works good for ladies too and if you have an even smaller appetite or an adventurous gourmet you can always feel free to add on some of the tasting menu of small portion i would be going back for more for sure, a perfect location with a hight class service and really friendly staff food was great and they also give good advises o wine a must do in town, went with a friend for dinner were greated very friendly and were take to our seats at the bar amazing service from a to z  food was great and prices are ok considering you are at a robuchon restaurant definetly a go, robuchons restaurants are among my favorites and i have enjoyed his restaurants in las vegas macao singapore and hong kong im glad they finally also opened in shanghai
there are several small tables for 4 most guests are seated at a bar  feels similar to a sushi bar
even though they just opened for a few months i have hosted a few dinners already the food is very consistent i enjoy the classic robuchon dishes like caviar with crab beef tartar suckling pig
this restaurant does not allow you to bring your own wine but considering their very good selection i can live with this restriction, the food are terrible and absolutly not worth the price  i know its in shanghai but really not acceptable for this name 
dont go you will spend money for nothing, joel robuchon is a pioneer an icon and a genius in modern gastronomy my visits to his paris  stgermain venue remains one of the best 10 fine dining experiences in the world  so i am really struggeling to give a 3 but after three visits in his shanghai venue my conclusion is there are really great reasons to go there for a fourth time and more and i will do  this being the only venue where i remain a loyal visitor despite conidering it less than a 4 but there are good reasons for a 3

it is located in the famous bund 18 at the setup is like a decent clubstyle infused upscale fine dining more cosy and intimated than mrmrs bund less loudvibrant than hakkasan and mroe stylish and elegant than m1nt  so you start at perfect 5+ seating will be at the bar  bao fangs or and club chairs with a spectacular lujiazui view this is really great furnishing and style is superpremium  forget your sneakers and choose instead your smart designer suit to feel well in this place

service is perfect absolute charming and considerate host and sommelier will give you an absolute perfect experience drinks are excellent and vine list is impressive and you will get the best sommelier service currently in town  so this remains a perfect 5+

the menue combines great classics of joel robuchon and some localized variations and what you immediately realize is that in the kitchen you have a great chef that went through the training of alain ducasse  the concepts and the presentation radiate the unique style of ducasse to create highly complex yet clearly structured premium dishes  so also here this remains a 5+

so where is the problem  it is the taste

we had some fantastic 5+ dishes
1 as amuse bouche a cold cherry gazpacho with frozen dehydrated powder of goat cheese or mozzarella my wife said which was delcious  the flavouring was so balanced that you forgot that the cherry is a fruit and you accepted it as a kind of substitute for the tomato
2 a deep fried artichoke with a kind of kurkuma mousseline sauce was perfect in every detail  the quality of the artichoke the crunch of the crust without any eycess fat the mellow onctuous spicy sauce with a puch of hotness chili or espellettes 
3 the bread basket is not only the best in town but one of the 10 best in the region

so still we are at 5+

but now come the lowlights of this visit  and we had similars in the past
1 a fried poached egg with caviar was simply not at the expectation  was it the quality of the caviar or the concept  but it lacked flavour  probably the dish would need more caviar to fully deploy the concept
2 the salad of truffle with foie gras shaves cruchy bread and garden radish was technically perfect in the execution but frustrating on the taste buds the truffle was of leathery taste and the foie gras shave too thin to overwhelm the unpleasant taste
3 a madai seabram dish was technically brilliant the fatty skin had been finely incised and than grilled to melt down the sue like taste of the fat while it kept the flesh juicy it came in a mediteranean jus but the taste was lost  despite the fine working on the skin the taste was still too fatty and the flesh was blant is it because of the wrong season madai is a winter and spring fish  the farming quality 80 of all madai are farmed  but would you not expect at this place wild catch grade or the concept  madai is often used for more vigorous seasoning in japan not sure but taste was not to my satisfaction  a wonderful place an excellent service  some perfact dishes but simply others not close to good 

but if you can try it and i hope than soon this review proves to be wrong 
n, we had the taster menu which was excellent 5 courses or 7 courses two of us opted for 5 the others for 7 some beautiful flavour combinations amazing presentation the waygu beef with foie gras was exceptional and the beef ginger consomme was outstanding the staff are attentive but one or two could speak a little more clearly when describing the dishes atmosphere is refined a little dark in places especially leading to the toilets overall an excellent experience","Italian cuisine",0.999667398231335
13,"decided to walk in around 8 pm on a monday  staff asked nicely if i had a reservation but as the place was maybee just 23 rds full i got a nice spot near the pizza oven watching the staff shovelling pizzas in and out
opted for the spicy salami broccolli pizza which came hot an crisp but kind if overloaded with cream cheese nevertheless tasty
washed down with a nice spanish crianza but 80rmb for a small glass definitely overpriced
overall nice but downside was the waiters who were very pushy to sell their overpriced sparkling water and half way through the pizza started pushing for dessert which i feel was not appropriate to ask while still looking at half a plate of pizza
the vibe is good but given the vast choices in shanghai hope they keep doing well definitely worth coming back, i wanted to reserve for a thursday dinner and i had to call the restaurant 4 times starting from monday leaving three messages on the responder before i could have a reservation done nobody have never called me back
im an italian leaving in beijing this was the third time i ate a mercato and i was completely disappointed by the food i thought they must have changed the chef no food was really wow even the tiramisu was just ok with no special taste food was completely different than what i thought the previous times the cotolette milan i am from milan style was awful the eggbread paste was completely detached from the meat and the meat pretty stiff and i thought they probably must have cooked it yesterday maccheroni with meatballs why the meatballs had a soar taste they shouldnt i dont know what happened but except for the position and the design this restaurant is not worth the money i brought a client to have dinner there otherwise i would have complained directly, awesome ambiance right on the bund i loved my pizza peas and cheese made in a thin crust oven however my lobster and crab ravioli was cold when it was brought to me also i had to ask for my check 3 times awesome spot if youre looking for italian  a pretty view good looking crowd as well they can up their service though, probably one of the better italian restaurants in shanghai and the closest you can get to a fine italian dinner anywhere in the city great atmosphere refined decor and very attentive service location right on the bund with an awesome backdrop of a lit pudong, i lived in nyc for several years i was very surprise the quality mercato offered

the pie is a good balance of bread and toppings

best part is the view call ahead for weekday reservation and youll get a view to remember, best restaurant to eat for a phenomenal view i went for restaurant week and the service was great the only thing that was disappointing was the salad but the main courses were very tasty, mercato has an amazing view of the bund i highly recommend sitting by the window to truly capture this view bread is to die for , the atmosphere in mercato is both warm and vibrant some of the nicest food i have eaten anywhere fabulous views across the bund make for an unforgettable dining experience cant wait to return, i had one of my best dinner experiences just recently at mercato from service to food all was just perfect i cant wait to come back very soon again, mercatos food  ambiance was really amazing our table had a perfect view of the bund  pearl tower specially at night i had a variety of pizzas that were unreal the pizza with the egg in the center and the pizza with truffles was the best ive ever had i look forward to coming back here, refined environment with an impressive menu well suited for any party great vegetarian options great service a+ experience, the restaurant has a vibrant exciting atmosphere with attentive and friendly stuff the pizzas and pastas were good the dessert especially the tiramisu and apple tart were fantastic but the highlight was the view of the bund at night simple fantastic the place is definitely on the high side though in line with every other place along the bund, food was simply amazing ambience  decor is gorgeous the views are spectacular their cocktail menu is really great  try the lemon grass cocktail, i love the italian cuisine and the wines even more also because i ate a couple of times at mercato in hong kong i went to mercato shanghai on jan 17 with high expectations

when entering the restaurant the look and feel is definitely good the set up of the bar is nice and the hostess and the bartenders are great after a drink at the bar we went to the table and there the trouble started i had diner with clients you choose a restaurant alike mercato because you do not want to worry about the food and the service you can concentrate on the conversation with the clients and enjoy the food and scenery in a restaurant like mercato one would expect flawless service you dont want to explain 3 times what you would like to have and than 10 minutes later have another discussion because the food and wine ordered is no longer available this is what happened and also during the remainder of the evening the communication was tiresome the food did not come at the same time or even did not showed up at the table i believe one of the reasons was that the waitress her english was very poor also the other waiters had difficulty to understand what we wanted furthermore i doubt whether they knew what was actually on the menu that evening i do not blame them but i believe the management should consider the language barrier and maybe blend in some people who master some basics of the english language i do not expect flawless english by any means but some of the basics would be nice in a international restaurant like mercato

the food was oke but not at the level what you would expect in this ambiance and with these prices the gambas i ate missed the flavor however the ravioli was perfect the wine list is extensive and the wine chosen a chianti was reasonably priced

i had hoped for more, my guests and i enjoyed the ambience and food at mercato this is our first time at the restaurant appetizers mains and sides all came beautifully presented and more importantly blended well and tasted great it is a little on the steep side without any alcoholic beverages the bill for 3 came to almost rmb1500 and all we ordered were two fish main courses and a ravioli it was also really dark and hard to read the menus otherwise we did enjoy our night out, came here to celebrate my bd during our short visit to shanghai the place is easy to find great atmosphere cant say it was quitebut it felt very alive you can see people from all over the world there we had pizza salad and wine wasnt cheap but great quality food they also send us a surprise cake with a candle so nice, what can i say about the mercato perfect fantastic views of the bund there is almost no better view available food is fantastic service first class general feel of the place is unbelievable when in shanghai i always visit have taken many people there for dinner and never had any thing but compliments reasonable prices especially for location it is a must for all travellers to shanghai, we went there as a group of friends as the place seemed worth a visit being well reviewed by many and located in the bund which is always a nice place to visit especially at night
although the staff was nice and attentive the food was unfortunately well below expectations we tried a lot of dishes and none of them really inspired us taste being mostly dull if you are looking for a nice settingatmosphere good service and are not so picky about food then you will enjoy your evening if you are a foodie you might be disappointed especially considering the price you will have to pay once the check comes, gets really crowded at night so better reserve a table in advance especially if you want one by a window the view is great atmosphere is the main reason to come here makes you forget you are in china the food is good but not the best italian in the city, my friend took me to the mercato as it is her favorite italian restaurant in shanghai its located just around the corner from the hotel i stay so its pretty convenient for me

its crowded that night and luckily we made a reservation so we didnt have to wait the restaurant has a chic and kindof modern decor with warm light and inviting ambience nice view of the bund for those who sit by the window just some tables though

the food is good the wine list is also good the service is good the price for me is a bit more expensive than the quantity and quality of food

nice place to checkout when you visit shanghai and feel like having italian food pizza and wine

cheers, dont get me wrong when im in asia i want local food that said mercado is a wonderful break away had the squid ink fusilli with uni clams and shrimp amazing scallop carpaccio is mind blowing lovely view of the bund and the landmark skyscrapers from the roof, the food is good but ive definitely had better italian in the city however the atmosphere is exceptional so my husband and i make our way to this location 23 times a year for that reason alone this is definitely a good place for a date night, great food and vibe pricing is relatively high especially the wine excellent tuna tartar and specialty pizzas, ive been here a number of times over the years but the fine service and food that it once had has now been eclipsed by other nearby venues to the point that in my view they cannot justify the price the food was standard and the service was poor and we left after the main given that the dessert and coffee orders never appeared, visited mercato for a date night while in shanghai and couldnt have been more impressed great ambience  dim lighting for a romantic feel yet open and vibrant for people watching service was super friendly and attentive and last but of course not least the italian fare was on point highly recommend if planning a trip to shanghai, the service here is impeccable and somewhat westernised in an otherwise very different chinesestyle service that i became accustomed to whilst in shanghai the atmosphere is lovely with perfect lighting good music and great views across the bund and the pudong skyline the food was very nice although i think overpriced for the quality and the quantity the wine is equally nice yet again slightly overpriced, i ordered the black yunnan truffle pizza with cheese and egg  the pizza arrived smothered with the most delicious truffle paste and a warm thick runny egg it was so delicious the polenta and the caramel sundae were very good too all that with a mesmerizing view, very nice restaurant the way it is decorated is just relaxing and design the waiters were polite and knew what they were doing we had the tagliatelle with black truffle and the tuna tartar which were very fresh and delicious i definitely recommend these dishes and this place to anyone looking for good food good service in a great atmosphere with a view on the bund, the general experience is not bad specially for the design of the architects neri  hu but the food is litterally not italian and this is not an italian place if you search a fancy french restaurant on the bund probably you are in the right place, went there on christmas eve with friends booking was made three weeks ago email enquired that they offer a limited a la cart on the date as one of us dont eat beef but then there were no a la cart at all the day we dined only set menu was available and no substitution can be chosen seating i was wondering why we were seated in a long table with like 12 people there but then realized there is a 2 cm gap between each table in short their view is good food is worth the price but i would not link it with jean george service is below average as they did their serving but nothing more, had dinner here on a recent business trip to shanghai really enjoyed it just had a simple pasta and a salad and glass of wine all really good service is good and the restaurant is very attractive nice italian food very enjoyable, i was very impressed with the food in shanghai in general but was sceptical when our hotel concierge recommended this place for some reason i was keen to go to another italian place i had researched but the concierge suggested we go here we spent an hour at the bar enjoying wines from a nice selection of by the glass wines then moved to a table with a wonderful view of the bund area and ate some excellent salads including a warm one and then shared 2 very nice dishes one of which was a perfectly prepared pasta writing the review a few months late so dont remember the exact details but italian food in asia can often be superficial this was a proper italian meal i recall  with depth i would have been happy to have been served this even if i had been in italy along with the music view and bar  turned out to be a lovely evening out for the two of us in shanghai, this is a great place to go when you want a unique and very international type atmosphere it is casual yet has an ambiance of being the place to be with a lot going on get a table by the windows in the back so you can see the bund and the lights in the evening the main type of food is italian but they have other options a great place to come and share some food and a bottle of wine, food checked ambience checked  service checked  view checked best of the best italian in town what else i can say, had a pre christmas dinner with my friend heard a lot about this place but never been there before ambiance is nice and up to most of places on the bund service is a little bit pretentious not sure for what are you there either serve them or listen their lectures
food is a different story as much as they try to present themselves as an italian restaurant food is not italian after all you see items from jeangeorge restaurant and getting confused portions are small but thanks for bread basket overall experience just average at some point you feel that price you paid for dinner could be spend somewhere else with better result, a nice change to the taste buds after a lot of chinese food we had the calamari lobsterprawn ravioli and pizza all lovely but best was maybe the chardonnay and the valpolicella wine got a table with great views very nice service as well, had a couple of good pizzas including a proper one in italy this place is one of the top tried one with cheeses and ham cheese taste like it is freshly made and ham is european dough and big pizza wood burning oven closing perfection circle if i really had to pick rocket taste better in italy but it is probably not a season for it anyways would highly recommend to try if you like pizza this is the top service is ok would say out of 5 places we tried this will be second best, went there with 2 friends on weekday love the ambiance and dark lighting modern interior and sexy mood we started with some delicious cocktails by the bar service was fantastic love the menu selection we shared lots of starters my favorite is the raw sections fresh quality seafood with super mouth watering dressing the elegant portion is perfect for girls at night mid range price on the bund strongly recommended, dined here with 3 colleagues from the local office and it was a very good night we had some drinks at the bar before sitting down and sharing large plates of fresh snapper beef and duck the fabulous meal was accompanied by a bottle of brown brothers patricia shiraz which we took along and they gladly opened the staff were friendly and attentive the meal was delicious and you cant get a better view of the bund by night, i found mercato italian restaurant through tripadvisor that i really trust however i would like to mention some things
as you enter the restaurant the feeling is that you will have a very nice dinner since the atmoshere is ideal
there is a bar where you could have a drink at first and also smoke that was very unexpected but we like it because we are smokers
after that when dinner starts you understand that music is too loud and feels that you will have to eat quick and leave i did not like that at all
there are so many people who work there going up down all over the restaurant and are on a hurry that makes you also feel anxious
now as far as the food was concerned we ordered some appetizers that were delicious but the main dish was not nice dishes were cold and some other very hot and the tastes was not so italian however at the end we ordered a tiramisu which i have to admit it was really delicious
generally i believe that the personnel must be more professional the food more tasty and to reminds more the italian flavors
regards, mercato lived up to all the great reviews we have been given by friends the food was delicious the service was excellent and the ambiance was delightful my husband and i sampled a crudo two apps a pizza a pasta and two desserts we were so full we practically rolled out of the place i had the ginger pear mocktail which was absolutely delicious and refreshing it is so nice to have finally found some really good italian in shanghai we will be returning her regularly, who knew shanghai is now home to a world class pizza restaurant in the shape of mercato on the bund the truffle pizza was our top pick but the sausage and kale pizza ran it close they also seem to understand how to make good dessert and coffee, mercato is an already well respected and highly reviewed restaurant on the bund you expect high end italian food expertly prepared

so i drop by at opening time when the pizza oven is at its optimal performance and the pizza guy has time to pay attention to your pie

i ordered the prosciutto pizza with arugula  no pizza sauce it arrived only a few moments later absolutely perfect there was not a flaw in this pie

so then a little dessert  a cranberry pavlova  literally there is nothing i could write that would do this justice the meringue was covered with some cranberries and a cranberry sorbet seriously i dont even like cranberries and i would not order anything else

the wine was very good  but the meal was a bit pricey i just do not like having to pay $10 for water

regardless the meal was spectacular better than expected even for such a great place  loved every bite, we arrived early around 1830 and the place was already very busy  it was a business diner and our chinese friends must be very powerful as we got the best table at a window corner with an ubelievable vew of the bund at night as much as i hate to act as a tourist  you must take the pictures and send them to your friends 
we were 4  two of us took a la carte and our chinese friends took the  menu to share 
i did not know what it means  but trust me  next time do take the  menu to share 
it means you get all the plates on the menu and there is more thenenough to share 
they got in total for 2  8 plates + 2 deserts 
regarding food  my friend from hkg is a foody and loves to go to places where chefs experiment + he loves wine
the sommelier advised us perfectly a pomerol and a spanish wine  delicious  very good advise
it started with a spicy tuna tartar  and surprise  first it seems as something simple then the after taste explodes in your mouth  we never experienced this double taste so strongly  it is a bit of fusion but delicious
then we had the burrata  put it in your mouth and again yu will get the taste in 2 times  the zeste of lemo that is hidden in it  is again something never tasted  only small remark  you almost do not taste the burrata any more  but the mixture scores
i followe with a pizza with trufles  3 cheeses and egg  perfect
one more remark about the angus beef  my experimeting friend could not stop talking about it  it was made with some added taste that i can not describe correctly  something like burned grapes and oignons  but maybe something else  but absolutely fabulous
desert  we were all full  but it was very good  the mixture of sorbet and chocolate cake + 3 different ice creams  made us all explode
thank you chef  we have found our new favorite place in shanghai
let me not forget  the service is top on the level  with a lot of tables and the restaurant was full, party of 3 for dinner on monday  close to the windows and fantastic view for sure  food in general tasty  the pizza maybe are not the best to take  we can say quality price ok  i put 3 stars for the service  very low level  one waitress small sweet a lot  and another tabacco also no much attention in a table in general  very dark place so thanks to our phone to give us light   need to improve  name and again only name  jean georges  , the food ambience quality service immaculate a melting pot of the best italian experience you can possibly enjoy must do when in shanghai, the food and ambiance in this restaurant is amazing we decided to visit here on our night in shanghai it was a very busy saturday evening and we did book the service was excellent and it rounded off our stay perfectly, mercato is a greatly located and beautifuly designed restaurant where they serve great italian food with a twist we had some nice antipasta a few very delicious and creamy pizzas and a veal milanese that was a treat for the taste buttons good food but even better ambiance, we showed up on friday evening around 6pm with no reservation we were seated at a nice table with a good view of the bund service was very good definitely attentive enough maybe others experienced poor service if the restaurant was very crowded we certainly had no issues the food was very good my sisters pasta was a tad over cooked but very flavorful i had a shrimp  lobster ravioli texture of the filling was more dumpling like than i expected but still good if you are looking for a change from chinese its a good choice they have an early bird special that is definitely worth checking out, i always go to mercato and i never regret or feel bored as always they have something new when it come to atmosphere i believe its one of the best in shanghai as they have it all food you cant flaunt them and they very consistence at all the time specially because the service is always good that support to entire package

amazing place with friend or date must try","dumpling restaurant",0.999820955916662
130,"in my opinion the best japanese food in shanghai the food quality is unbelievable and if you want the chef honda sun even organizes specialities for you from japanese fish markets really a great japanese restaurant which makes you feel just direct at the tokyo fish market, loved the japanese restaurant at the jing ann shangrila  some great food nice wines and very attentive service great place to have a business lunch, we sat at the sushi bar which is where we usually sit if we go to a japanese restaurant in order to get a fresh orders and watch the chefs work the service is great staff speaks english and the menu is extensive its indeed a beautiful restaurant and its hard to fault the settings and general atmosphere in terms of food i felt the fish could have been more fresh i definitely tasted the frozen chutoro for such a heavily advertised restaurant i didnt see the head chef when we were there and the fish quality could have been better, theres better options out there for that price service was okay as some of the senior looking waiters doesnt give you the attention but have to be called for they dont really give a hoot since im eating alone, had a quick lunch here chose a mixed sushi platter which was amazing colleagues had the fried eel and also beef dishes which were also apparently very tasty was not quite sure about their soups

they have tried hard to give a japanese feel female waitstaff were in kimonos but that almost give it a faux feel to it for me and was not necessary tasting the food was all that was warranted to let you know that this was a great japanese restaurant, sushi bar chefs knife work was a visual art and their recommendations were excellent the shocu was also excellent go ask the sushi chefs whats just arrive today and get them to serve up a platter, my wife and i went here on a spurofthemoment we have a craving for japanese date since it is close and features an experienced chef from the well known nadaman restaurant group we gave it a try for the price they charge and the reputation it was very disappointing my wife had the sukiyaki set and found the beef rather chewy and the rice very average i had the tsuru signature course replacing the japanese lobster course with a small plate of sushi my courses were pretty good but without the special delicateness that is a feature of great japanese cooking especially disappointing was the rice the sushi rice was below average my wifes white rice was just okay and my special rice which is flavored and suppose to come out with a nice crust was very average not only that but when they served it the filled my rice bowl nearly to overflowinga capital offense in japanese cuisine and not something that would be done in fine chinese dining as well for a supposedly five star restaurant in the very high end shangrila hotel in puxi the staff was undertrained the price rather high and most importantly the food quite average there are many better ways to spend your money in shanghai, every time i come to shanghai i would not miss this fine gourmet restaurant the food is always equal and well executed
i definately recommend it, if you want ti eat japanese food on the same level and quality like you can have it in tokyo then you have to visit this restaurant  it is just the best japanese in shanghai, nice ambience good food and relaxed atmosphere good rating overall had tuna sashimi rice set nice light though filling good place for a leisurely lunch, tsuru at the jingan shangrila has become my regular japanese favourite in shanghai its beautifully designed and laid out from the tasteful and unusual brick and wood lift lobby down the interesting ramp into the bar and main dining area it just flows with a lovely combination of private rooms and open plan dining the view outside on to the piazza fountains and the mao space is restful and the whole ambiance is calming and delightful

and the food and service isnt too shabby either my favourite for a light but satisfying lunch is the humble chirashi set which is beautifully executed but ive never been disappointed with any of the other raw or cooked options the front of house team are very welcoming and engaging and really seem to enjoy their work altogether a great experience for lunch or dinner at a reasonable price too given the hotel environment quality and service can we persuade them to do a japanese breakfast too , nice venue and large varied menu we tried some different lunch menus the dim sum was so so but the sushi was really good a bit pricy for china but all in all a good place to eat, finally on my birthday had a chance to try this lauded place i jingan i was expecting five star fantastic but really i got nothing that separates its food quality from any high end japanese restaurant in town

the set meals are well developed and executed i argue that serving sashimi on pure ice is not the most appetizing way to eat sushi the cuts are small and compared in value to other places not much better

the entry experience space sitting and care for a high end hotel restaurant all good but really when it comes down to it separating in quality and value and experience is important, very nice restaurant  service manager is attentive and sushis are fresh and taste goodprices are sangrila prices  at medium high range so do not expect a cheap sushi dining experience recommend, to whom is favor to real japanese culture and never disappoint to its biz lunch which offers various choices, everything that i thought it would be in more this place is so good and just what i expected so delicious i could hardly stand it, i have dinner with some friends here for the first time this place is excellent the design is very nice and tidy the food is fresh and delicious i am impressed by their service they are very polite and considerate especially the manager she is very professional she chitchat with us to make sure all things are good if you are looking for a decent place to enjoy high quality japanese food this is where you are looking, we always have joyful time in here its hard to find a decent restaurant with excellent food kinki is the must order dish and sake in sh esp with excellent service the manager christina is the one you need to meet excellent service and make you always feel like home, lived in sh for almost 8 years tsuru is my favorite place whenever i am craving for sukiyai  beef love the food arrangement from honda san  christina both are awesome with professional  warm services all staff are nice toolast time there was a sake tasting which three of us were totally spoiled  drunk with smile highly recommended, this is a very high quality japanese restaurant food is very refresh taste is good surprisingly christine wang the service manager is very professional we discussed topics for quite a long time very late however she accompanied us and treated us some white wine very good experience strongly recommend, fantastic place nice food friendly staff professional set up highly recommended located in the center and with delicious wine, the restaurant is very nice  excellent servicegood place i think i will visit frequentlycuz its the best japanese restaurant i have ever been in shanghai, i go to the restaurant very often the food is excellent and the service is great

mr honda <u+672c><u+7530> <u+653f><u+5b9e> is a famous chef from tokyo he always uses the best material to make anthentic japanese food of the original taste the restaurant manager ms wang is a nice lady speaking chinese japanese and english

my family and business partners also like the restaurant very much we think tsuru is one of the best japanese restaurants in shanghai, we were invited by friends to tsuru for a celebration lunch though a little difficult to find on level 2 of the shangrila hotel the effort was worth it this is the best japanese food we have experienced in shanghai authentic cuisine presented by a master chef from japan certainly a little gem of a restaurant that is highly recommended service was great and tommy really looked after us well, i have been to tsuru for my colleagues promotion its high quality japanese food with a good value set menu the kitchen is fully open so you can watch the action if you choosethe food taste was great

the service was excellent and people were very friendly and courtesywe seated in private room its very privacy

its memorable and pleasant dining experience i will come back again","dumpling restaurant",0.761741730314372

this restaurant was so so for me because i order 4 dishes and taste and favor not exactly same the originaland too oily food for me, best of the best in town

delicious and very thai great on the money and amazing

try the coconut jazmine rice the shrimp soup and the pad thai

you cant miss this place if you are in town, urban thai is a very special treasure in the heart of shanghai the food is authentic thai very cosy and super service but is small restaurant so youll be lucky to find a place truly for thai food lovers, its a small little shop that sits maybe 20 people or so but the food is excellent with the exception of the pad thai i tend to always order takeout from here and always the same dishes papaya salad pandan chicken and a good serving of coconut rice, we stumbled across this restaurant after finding nothing that appealed to us urban thai fit the bill perfectly and we enjoyed a very good dinner in a splendid atmosphere small and quaint with quick service, me and my friend have previously visited urban thai at another location and it was lovely however this time we were very disappointed
firstly i ordered some coconut rice with my curry which didnt arrive for 5 minutes when i asked there was some correspondence between staff and they said they had run out it was a bit odd that they did not think to inform me of this and the staff were actually going to let me sit there with nothing without telling me this dont know many people who could eat a spicy curry with no rice when i told the waiter he got me some jasmine rice in another 5 minutes at this point if nothing else had gone wrong and the food had been nice we would of let them off
my friend ordered a pad thai and is a strict vegan so requested for no fish sauce or egg to bd included the waiter even asked if she was  a strict vegetarian and she replied yes even though she clarified with the waiter numerous times that she wanted no egg the pad thai came out and it had what looked like egg or tofu in it after a few bites we both confirmed it was definitely egg and not tofu we asked the waiter if it contained egg and he replied he forgot to tell the kitchen he apologised and took it back next time the pad thai arrived it had a fishy taste to it so my friend left that too as it clearly had fish sauce in it the food at best was mediocre and you could definitely tell that the staff were not mentally there the waiter seemed to be more interested entertaining his group of friends rather than serving us as we were the only other table in here
i would definitely not recommend this restaurant and think they should understand the importance of listening to customers dietary requirements would it been a different situation if my friend had said she was allergic to egg although i can understand that the staff may have worked a long shift it is definitely not ok to not take veganism vegetarians or allergies seriously i am sure all of you vegans and veggies out there can understand how upsetting it is when you unknowingly eat these products and you definitely do not expect to have your requests ignored when you go out for a meal
to top it all off at the end of our meal when we were finished and looking round to pay the waiter was stood in the corner on his phone with his back to us so we actually had to get up to get his attention when he asked us if it was ok we just said yes as clearly nothing would have been done about the bad experience and we both just wanted to go home

there are much nicer restaurants in shanghai with much better service and food so give this one a miss, first time i visited urban thai changle lu i was impressed by the service and staff clean placedelicious thai food and very reasonable price definitely will go back again and try other locations, cozzy and quite restaurant excelent fresh rolls and seafood green curry they can modulate the spicy degree of the curries, cosy atmosphere and friendly staff the food was amazing i really felt like i was in thailand me and my friends had appetizers two mains and a tom yum soup which was really tasty we also liked the sticky rice mango dessert and the milk tea
i definitely recommend this restaurant in change lu, i was really curious because a couple of people already recommended this restaurant so i decided to try it for dinner with some friends
the ambience is really cosy and the decorations are beautiful perfect for a date
the restaurant was full and a part from us all the other clients were couples
i have to say that the food definitely met our expectations we had a mixed appetizer a salmon salad a coconut rice a pad thai but the stir fried basil chicken and tom yum soup where my favourites i am not a fan of sticky rice but i have to admit that also the mango stick rice dessert was pretty good
also the staff was very nice and polite

i recommend this restaurant to all thai food lovers me and my friends were satisfied about all the dishes and we loved the ambience we will go again for sure, urban thai
a reliable little thai treasure ive remember when it first opened years ago and friends and i used to go for our weekend get togethers great intimidate spot for a quick thai bite as its cozy with the ability to fit up to 20 people so always call first as to not be disappointed this time i went with my husband i ordered my favorite tom kha kai the coconut chicken soup and it was creamy and the chicken was tender another favorite of the night was the spicy salmon salad that was fantastic and it had great flavor the red curry and pandan chicken were good too i always order these my husband enjoyed his food with a ice cold chang beer overall it was a nice thai night the service was good as our waiter was attentive, i liked the place and the service was quite welcoming
the food was quite enjoyable better than many thai restaurants in shanghai so the overall impression was good
i will probably return there, visited on a monday evening and were surprised by the cute restaurant that sits a maximum of 16 people and only accepts cash the chicken satay where 6 pieces of delicious chicken in a peanut sauce for our main order we had the chicken pad si ew and the green curry the pad si ew was okay it felt like it was missing something the green curry with a side order of coconut rice was out of it world a perfect mix of spicy and curry flavor for dessert we tried the coconut ice cream and the mango ice cream both were really good too if looking for something different this is the place to go, we have visited the restaurant on changle lu several times and are always happy with the delicious thai food they serve the restaurant is small but intimate staff are friendly and welcoming
we had a special birthday surprise recently and asked for urbanthai to deliver a meal outside central shanghai yohan the owner was fantastic and arranged everything for us seamlessly meal was delivered on time and was of the usual excellent standard thanks yohan
urbanthai is highly recommended and the owners will go out of their way to assist you with any out of the ordinary requests, good thai food served fast wifi did not work but not a big deal as the food was qui and good green curry was a little running but with great flavor, i tried many thai places and this one is the best one i live all dishes there they are just great you can get nice brunchlunch sets for 100rmb normal dinner is around 200rmb place is quite small but has nice atmosphere, all i can say is yum please go try the coconut mango pudding i mean yumatmosphere in there is great and the staff is super nice  if your are traveling to shanghai please go there  you will not be disappointed, i visited the location on changle road more than one time and always with a nice group of friends although small size restaurant the space did not bother our dinner we were served amazing thai food that we shared in the middle quality of food is above expectation and service as well overall i warmly suggest this small thai restaurant full of thai atmosphere and mostly for its amazing dishes at an affordable price, this is my goto choice for thai food in shanghai the service is great and the food tastes exactly how i remember from thailand if not better order the green curry with chicken their papaya salad and the shrimp pad thai, environment
really cosy and comfortable the place is rather small but that makes it more intimate in my opinion definitely worth recommending for a date

food
after trip to thailand i am absolutely in love with thai cuisine although i was sceptical about the thai food for that price in shanghai i was pleasantly surprised it was really authentic thai food that i remember from thailand

service
really nice polite and englishspeaking waitresses service was fast and i simply can�t say any bad word about it

overal
amazing food bringing memories from adventures from thailand for a decent price absolutely worth checking out, lunch set was exceptional i had two excellent dishes tom kha gai chicken coconut soup and gaeng keow wan green veg curry very reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food and the manager could not have been nicer or more helpful the space is small be prepared to sit close to other patrons, this small and cosy place on changle lu offer very good and authentic thai food reserve a seat and you will not regret, if you enter this small restaurant you will not smell the typical chinese restaurants smells the used cooking oil

we ordered thai green chicken curry it is wow coconut flavour is there chicken meat is well sliced the veggies are perfectly cutted and fresh and the spicy taste is there try their fresh coconut juice it is very tasty rice is well cooked

the ambience is relaxing soft music in the background lighting is balance decorative accordingly, i was definitely expecting more from a thai restaurant in shanghai most of the time they are all good this one is not so great pretty pricy for what they offer maybe because its in the centre of a french concession
first of all its very tiny people are basically sitting all together dont go there on a date no privacy haha but its not the most important thing in the restaurant its all about food thats where i was disappointed no matter where i am i always try green chicken curry and pad thai in a thai restaurant they turned out to be a bit greasy and flavourless the service is also so so cant find any pros to go back, pricey food for untraditional thai food the tom yeun gung was lack of herbal taste such as lemongrass but extremely hot service staffs are untrained and made so many mistakes on our order and kept disturbing to the conversation as its no1 thaihouse we would he have expected for a lot more
disappointed meal, good food and great environment the curries are very good and i loved the thai iced tea there will be going back, went there for the first time last night the curries were amazing also the appetizers were good the service was super good and cordial something you dont get too often here in shanghai i will definitely go back to try more, freshness and art in food making so sublime that it takes you to a spiritual dimension same happens with the right massage place very infrequent experiences but to cherish, had lunch today for the first time and everything was delicious perfectly balanced flavors and very tasteful curries the restaurant is really tiny and it feels intimate and special urban thai is a perfect choice for a very refined thai meal will be back, luckily the lick the bowl incident was at home with the left overs but i wanted to do it at the restaurant too i ate so much food that it hurt but i couldnt stop so good i love the clean and simple taste but its all so savory and delicious highly recommended and yes order the green curry i also enjoyed the pad thai and spring rolls but the curry took the cake on this one clearly , ive been to the restaurant a couple of times now and the food has been amazing both times the service is fantastic urban thai provides everything that you wish for ive been to thailand a few times and the taste of the dishes that i had here are exactly the same cant wait to come back, having never been to thailand i cannot comment on authenticity but i can say that every time i have come here i have been overwhelmingly happy with the food so much flavour in these dishes the green curry and the fishes are succulent and just plain amazetits

make sure to give mami a big hello when you go in there she is the warmest most loving thai lady in all of china, being a former resident of thailand and also being half thai myself i always have a craving for thai food finding a place in shanghai that is close to authentic is hard because most thai restaurants in china have a chinese component to it i have to visit urban thai every week because it always satisfies my cravings the people who compare or complain about it not being as authentic as thailand seem to be forgetting something we arent in thailand no cuisine is going to taste exactly like the actual place but urban thai definitely is the best and it hits the closest to home the old thai lady chef told me stir fried basil taste amazing with thai basil we tried bringing basil from thailand but they spoil even with the basils they buy in shanghai their stir fried basil is awesome order an egg on top to make it street style the thai iced tea is to die for its exactly like the street carts in bkk the red duck curry is also a must try i recommend ut to all thai food lovers who just want a taste of thailand in shanghai, i will never call myself a thai food expert but i know good food when i taste them we had a big group over 10 people so we pretty much ordered the entire menu everything was delicious and we fought over the last morsels and chased it down with bottle after bottles of house white with 10 of us we pretty much took over the entire restaurant and it felt private and homey service was impeccable and i love the location a definite win in the shanghai urban landscape, it was my first thai food experience and i loved it we enjoyed several dishes and everything was excellent good point for the waitress always smiling, i had been promising myself i would visit this place for a while so when i was invited there with a friend for lunch i naturally took the opportunity and said yes urban thai is pretty much exactly what i expected its a small friendly cosy non pretentious place that serves good tasting good value food i cant comment on the authenticity of the dishes as i dont know thai food well enough but i can say i very much enjoyed what i ate and will go back if its any indication of the popularity of the place since having lunch there i have tried to re visit but the evening i tried to book it was full

as a place to go and eat alone or with friends i would happily recommend you check it out, i went to this place several times and it was the first times i ate thai food it is amazing really  becareful to the green curry the taste is awesome but it is very spicy all the menu is good
the place is tiny but nice i really liked the blue decoration inside

i place i would recommend i you want to have a great and quiet dinner in shanghai , a group of 5 of us were very looking forward to this based on the great reviews on the web my wife and i are true lovers of thai food we travel to bangkok just for dining mostly eating in very local places some of which only have menus written in thai we know real thai food this is not it that is unless you consider the tourist restaurants of patong to be the real deal pad thai lacked balance of conflicting flavor that characterizes a great pad thai tom yong gong lacked ingredients such as kafir lime leaves galangal much less lemongrass it was a mildly hot and sour liquid with a few shrimp we had something called curry that was a thin brown tasteles liquid with a few pieces of meat chicken satay was a gray color like old pork all of us worried when we arrived and were the only diners in the place a truly bad sign in shanghai if you are into thai tourist food go for it however if you truly know thai food look elsewhere, my food was later than the others
but it had value to wait
sweat and saur fish
and other are was awesome compare food in thailand

also i appreciate help from yoan rigartlenisa
sweat service made me write this review, first of all urban thai is very cozy perfect for a date or a business lunch reasonably priced good and authentic thai food definitely a nobrainer when you are in the french concession staying at the hilton on huashan road or working at the center, its been a while ive had such good thai food located in busy and green changshu road urban thai offers about 16 seats and filled with food perfume a chilling navy blue color and nice traditional but not exhuberatn thai decor the cook is a cheerful and energetic thai lady who comes up to you and gives you suggestions i took the chicken cashew starters  which i was less impressed by  and a marvellous tom gha kai soup that exceeded my expectations great value for a filling meal especially when accompanied by the cool milk tea beware no local or foreign cards accepted yet, the place is quite small so need reservation
but it is authentic thai food the chef is thai this is a rare case in china
love their thai iced tea papaya salad  pad siew, its definitely thai food some dishes are better than others the tom yum soup was good but not great the pad thai too in general its a good place possibly a bit pricey for what you get but the wait staff is great the location is good and the atmosphere is excellent, love the pad thai from this small hole in the wall restarant have probably frequented it over 100 times last year i should have shares in the place, the location of the urban thai is very small around 6 tables especially at the weekend reservation is recommended
the is not too big but the food is amazing go and check it out","Jazz bar",0.99973774289356
133,"their roasted ducks look fantastic and taste even better highly recommended place in shanghai for peking ducks and other chinese food, probably one of the best roast duck place in shanghai many other innovative dishes although on the more expansive side a roast duck with pancakes and source plus 2 vegetable dishes costed 350 yuan aud 70 for 3 of us you do get free duck soup and a duck stir fry with the duck order the service was unnecessarily formal without friendliness but strict routines and many layers of hierachies making the service more like a military operation and unpleasant to the dinners, we came across this restaurant when walking by one day as it was close to our hotel so came back for dinner it is in a nondescript building on the 3rd floor not until you are actually in the restaurant does the atmosphere comes alive seriously scrumptious food not to be missed very popular with locals fabulous selection but the best is the delicious duck, we wanted to have a traditional peking duck experience and this place wont let you down the visit was made even better by the waitperson named happy who speaks very good english and has a great sense of humour

go there hungry or in a large group as you wont leave with any room to spare

the food is exquisitely fresh and unbelievably tasty

we are going back again, 3 of us ate here for a business dinner our chinese host ordered and he did a superb job with an assortment that we shared sweet  sour chicken chicken with nuts superb dumplings and finally the roast duck that they carve in front of you meal with drinks was very reasonable and came to 509rmd or just about 60gbp
service was very good we had a small side room that made business discussions more private, best peking duck ever and at a very reasonable price this was our best meal in shanghai vegetable dishes were also excellent, searching for a restaurant late at night we stumbled across this restaurant the general area and the large building seem unpromising but there are a number of signs outside the 3rd floor location was a little hard to find but the effort was well worth it the interior is superb and has a classy upmarket but authentic feel
a short wait for a table enabled us to peruse the extensive menu good english translations our greeter named happy spoke very good english and was invaluable during the evening id highly recommend asking for him 
we didnt have the duck but the food we did have was excellent we did overorder as happy had warned  but the bill for 2 people was 240yuan approxaud$50 for several courses each including drinks probably not cheap by china standards but well worth it we felt, ill start by saying this restaurant is expensive for what you get they also dont serve wine by the glass which is an almost must near the bund for tourists these days we waited a long time between dishes and discovered wed been all but forgotten the duck was eventually carved at our table  nice touch but the worst bit was that both me and my husband woke at 2am with crook stomachs next 24 hours we were not very happy and can only put this down to this restaurant we had much better meals including peking duck even discounting for the upset stomach on our 6 day holiday in shanghai, having tried duck pancakes whilst in beijing on a different trip i was hoping to find the same whilst in shanghai and this place did not disappoint
the menu had pictures for every dish which made things easier we ordered the super roasted duck we didnt know the difference between the styles of duck they did and due to lack of english it couldnt be explained to us we did get exactly what we wanted which was the duck pancakes and more
we also ordered the fried dumplings and sweet and sour pork
the sweet and sour pork was mostly pineapple with not a great deal of pork
the dumplings were delicious and would definitely order again
the duck was very tasty plenty of pancake to go with it however we should of ordered a little more sauce which would of been easy enough it was fairly easy to find we were staying at yu garden find henan rd south  head into town its on the corner 3rd floor of a building so look up not at street level, oh man whether you indulge on duck or just settle for sides this is a classic lovely setting and friendly staff i was in heaven, im not a meat fan so my husband had to order the whole duck for dinner the presentation was fantastic he loved the duck wraps he devoured the duck with onion stir fry in a sauce  said it was the best the duck soup was ok my courses were delicious the eggplant was the best i have ever had as well as the scallops which were crunchy and in a great sauce bit pricey but well worth it this was an experience im glad we didnt miss out on and i highly recommend you visit this restaurant, not only the peking duck is fantastic but all the meals are of a very high standard our host provided us a journey through the menu and we were very much impressed absolute must do, i�d say this is pretty much the real deal wood fired fire place to roast the ducks traditional chinese furniture and setting up an elevator on the 3rd floor of an older monumental building on henan nan lu beware that if you are heading north on henan road you may not see the big red sign that says �traditional beijing roast duck restaurant� but by the time you get to yan�an elevated road realize that you have transitioned to n henan from south and turn around it will be staring you in the face like many popular restaurants in the city these folks are set up to handle foreigners so their english is good enough better for sure than my nonexistent mandarin the menu is huge but full of good pictures and our waiter let us know when we had ordered enough there were two of us and soup an appetizer and a single �imperial duck� was more than enough i�d have to say that the sweet and sour egg drop soup served in a big bowl for multiple servings for each of us competed for first place with the duck i�ve had �peking� duck in a lot of places and actually find it a little bland but don�t let that stop you it is an experience they give you a choice of a soup made from the bones or frying them up to gnaw on at the end of the meal we choose the latter and the crispy fatty bits were delicious not much of a choice in beer i am sorry to say but all in all a nice experience cheap too we got out for about $40 a piece, their peking duck was nice but not fantastic do not order the steamed fish as it was costly yet full of scales and wasnt well steamed vegetable and toufu dishes were nice, roast duck was tasty so were the cold noodles and the salad service is quick and efficient i could not be bothered about the pumpking rice dumpling soup its way too sweet for my taste but typical shanghai dish, we ordered too much and left very happy the duck was smoky and succulent the outstanding dish for me was the wafers with kiwifruit and crispy duck skin really something special, if you want to eat duck search no more this was a great find in or opinion be sure to be hungry the staff dont speak english very well which made ordering interesting we ordered the emperor menu was in the end was everything duck you do have to wait 50mins for the duck to roast over the fire go have a look at the back of the restaurant food was delicious, dont get too impatient this is a long process to get food on your table but once delivered the duck is excellent i heard people complaining but i went there 5 times and was never disappointed i heard also that it is possible to reserve however i never did and i always got a table within 15mn, good place to have peking duck its a good local experience friendly staff but have some difficulties with english but that makes the evening also a bit more special, wanted to have peking duck while in shanghai and were really happy to find this restaurant we were fortunate to dine with friends from china who spoke chinese which definitely helped with ordering a fun menu the restaurant itself was really beautiful and there were many ducks hanging over the oven when we first walked in  none when we left  the duck was delicious that skin is so good it was carved off to the side of our table and i missed it so that was a little disappointing but did not lessen the experience of enjoying the meal we had several dishes and all were delicious loved the green tea cake with taro for dessert, this restaurant was recommended by a colleague as his favorite place for peking duck in shanghai he has lived in town for 5 years and he said without hesitation this restaurant

we got there right at 530 and we were immediately seated the wait staff was very helpful and we ordered a duck for 2 and hot and sour soup as you will see when you get there this place is really focused on duck

the soup was very good some of best i have ever had the duck was excellent the flavor was good and the show of carving the duck was all a really nice experience

the duck head on the plate i could have skipped but that seems to be the way they do it

a wonderful experience from start to finish, as someone who hasnt always been very adventurous with foods this resturant was amazing the waiter that spoke english was so great and helpful to our group food was amazing definitely a must visit if you are in shanghai , went to the restaurant without reservation but we went there early around 530pm for dinner a bit tad early for dinner therefore were able to get a table intermediately ordered the famous peking duck  thats what we are there for sliced right in front of us the kids went wow

the skin is crispy and tasted perfectly with kiwi sliced meat with pancake is also perfect and the rest of the meat were stirfry delicious came with boiled clear soup which uses the bone  lightly flavoured but good

overall a wonderful meal that my kids enjoyed too, didnt have a booking when we arrived but only took around 20 minutes for us to get a table the food at the surrounding tables looked delicious and we were not disappointed when we received our food highlight of the dining experience is when the duck is carved right in front of your table very delicious food and would highly recommend, get in the restaurant rather late 2100 hrs where served by an nice funny guy we got the good advise and ordered a nice wine next to the roasted peking duck the skin was very crispy and tasted perfect than the pancakes where served all over opinion was perfect, this is a great restaurant and wonderful as regards service product quality and taste of the bestknown product of china peking duck i had gone to other restaurants in the world and eaten this delicacy more nothing compares to what we proved my family and me on a rainy afternoon more that has become extremely pleasant with what was prepared for us with great attention and care

an employee who seemed manager was the answer and spoke very good english calmly and was very helpful in clarifying details of our request

we were on the plate peking duck with 4 courses and was superb deserved applause for those who created and adapted so well combinations texture and presentation in this menu option

we were totally pleased with it and we chose this as unique dining experience in our passage through shanghai

this is an excellent option in shanghai, if you want beijing duck this is the place to go food was amazing they helped with ordering but you have to have the right service person at your table otherwise they tend to forget things like drinks and you constantly have to remind them, finding good food with western standards in china is a challenge this restaurant beats the challenge with their traditional food thats why it is a definite recommendation in addition to the duck their side dishes with vegetables are also delicious sweet and sour soup a bit on the spicy side for my taste was also getting good reactions from my friends, native friend took us there and its good that we went roasted duck was excellent i enjoyed every bit of it i would highly recommend also the hot and sour soup was so tasty try if you like it hot
afiyet olsun means good appetite in turkish, near my hotel i tried this restaurant i was happy to taste again beijing roast duck this evening
i went to the restaurant at 2030 almost all customers already finished to eat
duck was acceptablefew meat i must say a little desapointed of the quality and quantity
service was good
this aws an experience in a typical ambiance but i will not return, this is an excellent restaurant atmosphere and food were well worth goingthe duck was tender and moist and the service was great, this was my last day on my tour of northeast asia i wanted to have one more good meal the services was excellant our waiter spoke english and was very helpful with helping us to choose what to eat we order duck which was awesome spicy stir fry cabbage awesome and tasty asparagus what wasnt all the great was the kung pao chicken and kung pao shrimp more peanuts than meat just had this meal at another resturant in biejing and it was fabulous it had a good taste but the shrimp was more like shrimp bits the plate was piled with nuts not my best meal in asia but still good, located about 5 minutes walk from westin hotel

interior very pleasant food pricing is on the high side but well portion

must try the beijing duck if you are there, i do not know where to beginim speechless absolutely the worst service ive ever experienced in my life the manager of the establishment who is also the head chef even came out to insinuate that americans were not welcomed due to his inept management the third plate of duck i ordered the emperor duck it has 3 different dishes came out to us 1 hour later than it was supposed to even after the duck was roasted and the first two servings were eaten it took an hour for them to serve the last dish

when we refused to pay for it because we didnt believe it was our same duck if youve ever ordered peking duck before you would know that the duck is cut and served three different ways he became belligerent and made racist undertones in his words and attitude i didnt even mention that that the duck was already cold and wasnt even that good

he lied and stated that it was our fault for not informing them that we had moved tables when clearly the waitress had known at the beginning that we had moved and where we had moved to i even brought the waitress out to prove me right and when i was trying to explain to him about his error we argued and he says he doesnt ever want us back and they dont welcome foreigners like us we got into a yelling match the busboy belligerent chefmanager and other unknown restaurant male staffpossehenchman starts getting physical they insult my american wife and claimed i was unpatriotic im asian all we wanted was a nice meal ive never been so insulted and shocked in my life over a meal that they had screwed up on

the waitresses were trying to calm the situation but the chef and various male staff were atrocious with unbelievable animosity towards foreigners they made it a racial issue when it was clearly their inept service and food that we were complaining about

their duck wasnt even that good and definitely not worth the usd$80 that we paid i have had much cheaper and better in guangzhou and beijing respectively never ever had such a horrible experience at any eating establishment these guys give chinese restaurants a bad name

if i could give them no rating i wouldthis is the most unprofessional poor excuse for a restaurant the head chef who seems to be a part owner is arrogant a racist and belligerent, i would never go back to this restaurant and would advise anyone to avoid going here at all costs these people are liars con artists and dangerous to be around especially when it comes to foreigners

first my husband and i go to be seated and they sit us next to the kitchen doors i saw a row of tables open by the windows and i requested to be seated there we were told that those were reservation only seating so we took the table next to the kitchen door and ordered duck liver and the emperor duck which is 392rmb we were told it would take 45 minutes for the duck to be cooked which was fine by us after we had been sitting and chatting for almost 30 minutes i realized the tables by the windows i requested earlier were still open we asked another waiter and they said that you did not have to reserve those seats and that they were open long story short  after a lot of talking we got reseated where i first wanted to be although our waitress was very unhappy about it and tried to convince us to stay at our table

the duck skin came out and they served us at our new table yet they didnt bring us our wraps to wrap the skins in we had to wait a long period of time so by the time it got to our table our duck skin was cold i wasnt too happy about that but decided to let it go then we waited one hour for the rest of our duck dishes to come if anyone has had peking duck before  they know that is waaaayyy too long for the rest of the duck to be prepared considering its already cooked

by the time they had brought it to our table after multiple requests my husband and i were fed up we asked for the manager and complained we werent even sure if that was the same duck we had ordered and it was already cold when it came out eventually after making no headway with the manager  the head chef came out he was incredibly arrogant and told us its not his problem he gave my husband who is chinese the feel that he did not like foreigners im american when i tried to say that this treatment was unacceptable he started slapping his chest and yelling china china china so i knew he was a racist in over a year of living in china ive never seen such blatant racism by that time my husband and i knew we were going to get nowhere with people this ignorant

after we paid our check my husband told the head chef that he gave chinese people a bad name and that his behavior was completely out of line then the head chef along with a few other kitchen workers attacked us they literally started shoving pulling screaming cursing  it was absolute chaos they were screaming at my husband saying he wasnt chinese  and that foreigners were not welcome in their establishment some of the waitresses were trying to hold some of the men back  but they kept lunging at us and grabbing us i had to keep shoving people off of me and my husband and we kept telling them to get their hands off of us some of the kitchen workers were taking off their jackets and screaming cuss words at us  threatening violence against us even when we left they followed us downstairs and outside but the waitresses and a couple of the men that worked there got in the way and gave us enough time to leave

i have never been treated with such disrespect and hate here in china these people are the worst of the worst im surprised they havent had a lawsuit not to mention the food is barely mediocre  the duck skin was not crispy and it was overpriced for the quality you get there are plenty other peking duck places in shanghai  i would not go here if i were you they will try to con you and will lie through their teeth they are flat out dangerous to foreigners when they followed us outside i wasnt sure what they were going to try to do to us the people that work there are unpredictable and you are not safe if you dispute your meal this was just beyond belief, we have been meaning to go to this place for ages we had some visitors therefore we had a good excuse to visit wood fired ovens well dressed staff traditional chinese fare it had it all and reminded us of our visit to beijing i have had better duck at da dong in beijing but this is the best i have had outside of there very friendly staff good food and atmosphere a little over priced but i am comparing to china prices and not western prices worth a visit, the restaurant was recommended by our concierge at the hotel where we were staying a reservation was necessary i was a little sceptical of going as i dont like duck but went and was really pleased i did the duck was amazing and the service was outstanding nothing was to much trouble for the staff and our evening was every enjoyable we will be going back, when we arrived here the restaurant was at least two thirds empty but we didnt have reservations and they sent an english speaking waiter to convince us that we would have to wait forever but that he could have us accommodated in a private room if we were willing to spend 1000 yuan since a super duck is only y198 there was no way we could spend y1000 so we opted to wait anyway surprise surprise we were seated in five minutes we ordered two ducks and some other dishes the ducks were dry and the skins were not crispy what was worse is they gave us dishes that were totally different from what we ordered total bill came to y600+, at the end of a challenging business trip we were looking for an interesting fun meal and the traditional beijing roast duck restaurant did the job not realising that the duck would take quite so long we filled in the time by ordering a ver nice asparagus dish with some peppers and a somewhat undercooked potato thing it passed the time and the arrival of the wonderful was heralded by the arrival of the masked chef duck in hand

initially gentle biscuits with slithers of duck skin were presented and devoured followed by pancakes etc with a plate of delicious duck breast leg and head duck soup followed

a couple of beers did the job

the ony negative was that having arrived by 9pm they were closing up by the time we left","Turkish cuisine",0.999754538791622
134,"back on my visit to shanghai the weather was around 1 to 8 degrees as i stayed at radisson blue shanghai new world and the weather back in the days were super cold i decided to spent one afternoon at epicure on 45

this is the revolving restaurant on the 45th floor so as the resto roaming around you will be able to see the whole city of shanghai came for afternoon tea set the package was including 2 tea 2 dimsum and a full rack of sweet and savoury cake it was a lot of cake i ended up taking the cake away for snacking at my room since me and hubby were full enough

tho the interior is not as posh as any other fancy resto in shanghai i still feel it was a nice resto nice for dining and business meeting the tea time deal was also cheap i only spent rmb 208 for an experice at revolving resto as well as plenty of cakes tea and dimsum, since we stayed in the radisson blu we deciede to have diner in our own tower epicure is located on the 45th floor and has its own elevator from the lobby there is choice of kitchens in at your own table traditional japanese chinese indian and european cuisine so that is nice the prices are european the food is good portions are too small the restaurant itself is revolving spectacular views over the city in genral i would recommend if ony the prce leve would be a bit better busy not at all, the views out over shanghai are impressive from the restaurant as it slowly moves during the course of the dinner the food quality however was average overall 3 of the 7 in the group had deer ribs which was nearly all fat the others in the group enjoyed their respective plates

the overriding sentiment was the view overshadows the food that is disappointing because the restaurant could offer a unique experience making an experience for patrons that mixes both views and top quality food, if you want a birds eye view of the city lights of shanghai epicure on 45 is the place to be we booked dinner at the revolving restaurant on our last night in shanghai and were lucky enough to have a clear night with incredible views it would be very disappointing to go on a murky sky night as the view wont have the wow factor the menu is pricey but was delicious our son 13 yrs ordered the burger au$50 as they dont offer a childrens menu my husband and my meal were both lovely so no complaints from us just expect a decent bill at the end of the meal but if its a clear night its well worth it, this rotating restaurant at the radisson blu hotel new world is centrally located at nanjing road and gives a good view of shanghai, amazing resturant food was incredible and service impecible thats all before the views  they are stunning definately worth a visit 1010 from me, its a great place to see the city the resto is on 45th floor and it turns around 360degrees in 2 hrs the view is breathtaking but the food is not very impressive and very expensive we chose chinese menu and were very disappointed the australian wine was ok though, i was extremely disappointed with this restaurant the view over shanghai is fantastic but the menu was less than exciting and the service if any was slow and the staff seemed inexperienced it was not good value, this is the place to go for romantic dinner in shanghai the view is amazing the food is high quality with many different types of food so every one can find something for his taste they have great wines selection highly recommended great place, having spent the day walking in shanghai i decided to stay in the hotel to eat and treat myself to eating here yes the view is great but my god do you pay for it the food was so average it is completely forgettable i asked for a gt before my nra and the only gin on offer was gordons  really a bill of <u+00a3>97 for 1 person starter main course 2 glasses of wine and coffee is outrageous, my forst impression as i entered in this restaurant was omg the view is really amazing despite sky was foggy i really thought this is one of those special treats that make you forget the 12 hours spent in economy the day before service was great food was good price was a little bit higher than expected for shanghai but were still talking about midprice range for western standards i guess i would recommend to go once and check the view, great restaurant with lots of menu choices
lovely staff who spoke excellent english
would def recommend, a revolving restaurant on the 45th floor of the radisson blu hotel we loved it here  everything was amazing the food the service but particularly the view you get a 360 degree view of shanghai which is truly breathtaking  i couldnt take my eyes off the vista we went for dinner so saw the city in the daylight through sunset and then at night i would definitely recommend as a one off experience the food is expensive but it is worthwhile for the amazing views if you dont want to splash out on dinner you can enjoy a drink at the bar one or two floors above for a much cheaper price but still get the same amazing view, perfect for meal talking and view shanghai 360�
the food is good service very friendly
but the best is the view, the food is super service gray and view  360 degree breathtaking it is a real must see resturant , from my last review within a year everything seems to be so average about the restaurant except the revolving review
was completely taken aback by the kind of poor service was given by the staff the indian meal served by the chef was poor in quality and quantity both
my last visit to shanghai we were practically in the restaurant every day but this visit 1st experience was really sad hence we didn�t go the restaurant again i think they have deteriorated in both taste and service, this is a revolving restaurant and gives the best view of shanghai sky line especially during the night they serve 4 type of cuisines including indian the food is highly prized and is low on portion size and is average in taste but the view itself makes it up for everything, on sundays only from 11 till 230pm there is brunch soooo many food to choose from lots of fish veggies  meat and vegan dishes good desert choice and fruit nice coffee you can choose with or without wine from 350 till 450 excluding 15 vat and service not cheap but well worth the food and ambiance it is a serene quiet place not so suitable for children, we came for the view and thats what we got but thats all the food was way below average service was unprofessional and at times even unfriendly we had no expectations the only thing that usually matters at revolving restaurants is the expensive view and this one is not different, the restaurant rotates a bit more than one revolution during the time needed for a relaxing dinner view the beautiful lights of the city while enjoying wonderful food and a bottle of champagne just do it, i visited the restaurant early in the evening as i had a very early start the next day
the service was prompt and friendly and i was given a table right near the window
the full revolution of the skyline takes around an hour
the menu is extensive and has many options in terms of cuisine and i started with the speciality breads and dips which consisted of poppadoms naan breads and other nibbles with a selection of dips
the main course was the mixed grill of 3 cuts of beef with vegetables and an optional side of potatoes
the food was excellent quality and presented well it was also reason it priced considering the location
im not sure eating and watching the panorama at the same time is advised
a fantastic way to enjoy a meal and appreciate the scale of the shanghai skyline, everything except the prices and the view are just averagebelow par
white wine was served at room temperature crab gnocchi was made with reconstituted crab meat banana cheesecake was a sloppy banoffee pie in a whiskey glass unrefined service flashing disco lights and a distinct average hotel restaurant feel all for over $100 a head wish id gone somewhere else view was spectacular though
go to the bar for the view and there are much better fine dining restaurants nearby that are less extortionate, a fine dining experience high prices for food and drink but the view is spectacular as the restaurant revolves, an excellent restaurant with multi cuisine particularly impressed with indian food and chef shiv who made my evening more cheerful, food as decent but nothing too special and a little pricey for what you can get around the area the main reason to visit this place is the view i definitely recommend at night restaurant rotates for a 360 degree view over two hours give it a look, in the radisson hotel at nanjing road in shanghai you find this spectacular restaurant on the 45th floor
international cousins are served with elegant and luxury touch
the restaurant is rotating 360 degrees over the shanghai skyline fantastic
scallops as a starter australian beef and a lovely ice cream together with chablis amarone and espresso with nonino grappa
it was very very delicious
i would come back every day

 5 stars in chinashanghai, i had read many disappointed reviews before i went so i knew what to expect but i loved the view so much that i would have been happy with anything the staff were delightful the food nothing special but to be fair they offer a very international choice for a very international clientele there are so many excellent restaurants in shanghai if youre looking for something exceptional go elsewhere what is exceptional here is the view, we took a lift that goes directly to 45 th floor this restaurant is literally on the roof of shanghai and as its turning 360 degrees more than once you can have your dinner or just your high tea you eat and drink 208 meters above the street level and have a panoramic view of shanghai skyline, we stayed at the hotel and didnt really feel like venturing out for food we had read the mixed reviews about this restaurant but we were really impressed there are a lot of indian dishes on the menu and an indian chef i had the tikka salmon and my husband had a steak we had the speciality indian bread and dips to start the food was absolutely delicious and exactly what we needed we found the bill really reasonable for the quality of the food and of course the wonderful views and overall fun experience in a revolving restaurant we will most definitely eat here again next time we are in shanghai, as the title says you go there for the view it is spectacular to enjoy the rotating view as for the food it is easy to forget i would not recommend this restaurant there are better quality restaurants close by, we decided to eat in the epicure restaurant on the 45th floor of the radisson blu for a special occasion supper in shanghai the novelty of the revolving restaurant was a draw as was the fantastic views offered of the city at night
the setting was all we hoped for and the service attentive however the evening was slightly marred by a noisy table that ignored their children running around and shouting near other diners something that distracted from a romantic quiet meal for two wed anticipated the motion of the restaurant took some getting used to being slightly more obvious than expected but the changing city skyline views were fantastic
the food was ok but a little chaotic and hurried breads with dips being served alongside the first course the restaurant provided some gluten free bread which was a nice touch wed opted for the curry dishes which were ok but rather salty the waitresses were a little too attentive at this stage and kept trying to take unfinished plates away which became rather annoying and made the meal feel rushed
having said that we enjoyed the overall experience and it wasnt as expensive as we at first thought it would be maybe diners need to be spread out a bit more to allow for some intimacy all the diners tonight seemed to be placed in one section of the restaurant only, this restaurant revolves at the top of the hotel the views are great but the general feeling us a bit dated the restaurant is divided into sections and when we went all the diners were placed into the same section i guess for ease of service but we wanted a quiet meal dinner and were put next to a big table of business people who also had noisy mis behaving children with them so not a good start
we ordered indian and also maybe not a good choice in china it was basic a bit too hot and fairly badly presented
we ate and left as soon as we could and in the end the view didnt matter because the food wasnt special a disappointment, we had dinner at this revolving restaurant and it was superb food excellent service excellent would recommend this restaurant 5 star, i chose this restaurant for the view the rotating floor allows for a 365 degree view of the city while dining it was relaxing to dine and take in the ambiance of shanghai the staff was very nice the food was average if you want a good meal but an amazing view you should try dining at epicure on 45,  thats all
the menu is not very varied anyhow taste is good and the staff is friendly
i was ordering first red snapper filet after abt 20 min the waitress came and told me its not available due to her bad english she was asking the chief cook for help and we find another solution
i gave 2 points less because in a 5 starhotel it cannot be the staff dealing with clients cannot speak englich and the limited western food, unbeatable view it takes about 15 hours for a complete revolution so you see the whole city while eating the food is very high quality but also quite expensive, rotating restaurant gives you a good view of the whole of shanghai city food is reasonably priced i had cesar salad for 120 rmb nice place very quiet during day time which i like, one of the best places in shanghai to have indianinternational food with a breathtaking 360 degree view of the city and all at a very average price a must visit in shanghai thanks to its food as well as thanks to its ambience and views it provides, we visited for lunch to take in the awesome view and ended up having lunch with wine so good we went back for dinner next night extensive food and wine menu reasonably priced considering the free view which is as good as the pearl tower
staff were friendly excellent english cater for gluten free, the epicure on 45 is part of the radisson blu hotel we went here for high tea the food and service was pretty good the 360� view of shanghai is amazing especially on sunny days would definitely recommend, well located on 45th floor of radisson blue this restaurant deserves every bit of appreciation
not just because it�s centrally located with exceptionally good view or it is a revolving hotel giving 360 degree view of entire shanghai also because they give good quality delicious sumptuous food with an extraordinary service
i would also compliment kevin the supervisor who took care of our food preferences etc etc extremely courteous and polite
in our 2 day visit we ate 2 times here its was an amazingly good food and extremely good value for money
evrey penny we paid was completely worth the quality of food and excellent view this revolving restaurant gave us from 45th floor, visited this restaurant a few days ago and must say that we were impressed nice views delicious food  we were explained by the manager that they just started with a completely new menu on 01 september the variety of the food was good pizza fish indian chinese we had a red curry with chicken thigh which was very nice grilled king prawn with rice and pizza yes indeed as remarked by other patrons it was a bit pricey but the portions are large the food was nice and the view fantastic oh and i forgot to mention that the service was impeccable if you want to see shanghai by night there is really no other place you need to go, worth visiting for the views as the restaurant turns way above the city waiters were all keen to make you happy and reacted quickly when my husband complained his main was cold they did say they had just introduced a new menu and were having a few glitches and were very apologetic and replaced his dish with no quibbles my pork was lovely and all in all we enjoyed the experience you do pay for the view though, epicure on 45 is one of the best revolving restaurant it is situated on the 45th floor in raddison blu hotel shanghai it gives 360 degree views of shanghai the cuisine includes mouth watering dishes of india too for vegetarian too there are many options the staff service is good and well behaved it was one of the good experience visitors must visit and enjoy the view, i had the gnocchi best ever like no gnocchi i have ever tasted my guest had the prosciutto pizza also incredible we both had tsing tao qing dao beer bliss

it was a friday evening at 7 and there was hardly anyone there highly romantic if you want to bring a datewife

view was incredible slowly rotating 360 degrees

staff was well mannered and polite

bathrooms a bit of a mission to get to must find the stairs then walk up 1 flight and making some turns to find them doesnt sound so bad in writing but you go and try yourself and youll know what i mean

a bit pricey but you are paying for great food and a super view so i would say well worth it if its in your budget, i was staying the the hotel so thought i would give the rotating restaurant a go
cuisine there seemed to be a lot of choices on the menu i personally believe that a smaller menu tends to mean better quality and i dont think i was proven wrong here i went for shanghai duck as i have only had peking duck before and wanted to know the difference but also some of the other meals seemed a bit pricey for instance almost all the indian dishes seemed over priced such as a potato dish for over 90rmb

food the duck arrived in a timely fashion but with little to compare with in terms of texture and moisture i think it would be unfair of me to comment i do think there was too much gristleinedible bits however

view overall good i liked the experience of a rotating restaurant but some of the windows seemed a bit distorted 

atmosphere there was not a lot of buzz or atmosphere in the restaurant there was a private party in an enclosed area nearby making a racket and climbing up the windows they were shouting a lot now i dont usually judge a restaurant by its patrons but this went on for 40minutes or so and the staff made no sign of asking them to be quiet, salmon was cold  i asked for medium done but it was actually cold

cocktail  singapore sling was nice

starter  bacon with asparagus disappointing again really oilyzero flavour i can do better with those two ingredients

slow service forgot to make the table before even though i made the booking

not very happy, this restaurant offered a variety of options to select from and the service was wonderful the views of shanghai are terrific and you are not rushed through your meal so you can enjoy both the food and the full circle view of shanghai, decided to try this place for afternoon tea it is served on the 45th floor it has great views of the city in the revolving restaurant that unfortunately that was the only good part the decoration is old and tired and the food quality was poor the scones were burnt and we could eat them sandwiches were tiny and poor quality as were the cakes much better alternatives in shanghai but the view was good, this is a revolving restaurant and has an excellent menu that caters to different styles japanese italian chinese and maybe one other
attentive staff and a great view make this an evening to remember","Sichuan cuisine",0.98892894225122
135,"excellent shanghainese food with very reasonable price the restaurant is not very close to the train station though but the value of the food totally worth the effort, actually it was my driver who was a shanghai native who recommended this restaurant since few years ago ever since then whenever i came here i always visited this restaurant first i recommend shengjianbao and shanghai vegetables as one of my top list for tea try the xihu tea, nice interior the service was great and caring the food was delicious shanghainese food i would definitly recommend it, i visited this restaurant many times years ago but even until now if i were to recommend any restaurant in shanghai this will definitely be in the list

the food is actually relatively cheap considering that it is by now a well known restaurant in shanghai operated for many years already and has multiple awards i didnt read it in detail but you can the list of some of their achievements at the shop

it is always with queue despite that there many many tables and multiple floors however the queue is never too long as the chef and dishes turnover are very efficient

it is in a old building thus the ambiance is not too bad with local chinese old day feel it is overall considered as clean and the services are fast you wont feel like you are left out with nobody to entertain your need

i would recommend you try as many as their signature dishes as you can especially if you are going in a big gang the fry brinjal in wrap is a superb it is tasty strong thick taste and the wrap lighten up the dish the fry you tiao with sweet sauce is a good food for kids too just ask for recommendation of food and you will not regret on whatever dish you ordered, big bright maybe overbright if youre looking for romantic proper restaurant amazing array of live fish  seafood in tanks for the chef to select from plent of wierd  wonderful if thats your thing  i ventured no further than eel  river prawns but photographic menu allow safer selection as well, fantastic local food big portion in a big old building yummy goodness for everyone food is light and delicious, the sign in the front said polo it looks like a family restaurant which gives it somewhat authentic atmosphere its actually pretty big inside most of the dishes were nice some were too sweet i liked the fried noodles the most, it is kind of local experience for us a bit noisy sometime heard people shouting around food was very authentic cheap and big portion highly recommend, was recommended this place by our accommodation its quite large and was full of people on a sunday night we ordered some lemon chicken which was like a sliced schnitzel accompanied by a very lemony sauce also the pot stickers not the best ones ive had in shanghai and some vegetables and rice all in all it was disappointing for me personally nothing jumped out at me the service was brisk but with so many places to eat in shanghai i wont be making a second visit, its only 2 blocks from jingan temple and have the sign polo in the building me and my friend try it twice on the weekend which is very crowded and on monday you can ask the waiter what the best choice in the menu we usually choose pork knuckle duck in oyster fried dumpling most of their food is have their own unique taste most of the menu price range from 20 50 70 rm the two of us get the best dinner for only 270rmb, sorry i dont know the transition of those dishes but if you ask waiters there they surely know there are large portion of every dishes so dont order too much this restaurant is famous and somehow waiters are very busy i think its normal that people waiting for a long time to order youre rightorder, weve heard of this restaurant in michelins guide it was good but  a dish with beaf was too salty people smoked in the local we waited quite a lot especially for dessert the waitress forgot it nevertheless we had delicious tea and kungpao was excellent, baoluo restaurant or polo in anglicized chinese or paul as the local expats call it came highly recommended by our local panda expat friends apparently there is quite a wait on weekends but we breezed right in on a wednesday evening and were seated immediately while not the best chinese restaurant weve been to in shanghai it is nevertheless known for its authentic and very affordable shanghainese fare favorites here include the sweet fried buns seafoodstuffed dough sticks and the dongpo steak portions are enormous so come in a group tables are gigantic too so be prepared to share tables when its crowded, old restaurant started with a really small place but now it became one of the biggest restaurant in the area local and nice food for a very reasonable price, recommended by a guidebook and the taxi driver who drove us there and this place did not disappoint we tried the duck toufu and pork belly all were good however perhaps we did not order the correct mix these dishes somehow taste similar located in a nice area where you can walk about 10 mins to the malls, i arrived at the restaurant before noon and it was almost empty so i had the pleasure of watching it fill up  and by the time my food arrived it was jammed no other westerners  it seemed to be a local crowd i can see why people mob the place service is quick food is delicious and prices are a steal

the menu has photos and english translations and there are numerous traditional shanghainese dishes from which to choose as well as other chinese fare the seafood is kept fresh in tanks so it is cooked on the spot

no one hurried me out even though it was busy i was free to linger as long as i liked over tea to soak up the atmosphere, baolou is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside so if they dont take your reservation they wouldnt take ours do not fear the place is huge when you get inside you pass tanks of fresh seafood its a fine restaurant with all chinese clientele partially due to the good pricing for the quality of the food as with many chinese restaurants there are pictures to help guide you we went back because there were so many dishes we didnt try the first time and all were good, most of the local shanghainese will tell you baoluo jiulou serves authentic shanghai cuisine by looking at their menu i am sure they have modernized a bit on the dishes they serve the price of dish is inexpensive and quality of the food is okay however the whole place smells like a cigarette if you are not a smoker and do not want to endanger yourself with secondhand smoke suggest to avoid this place, this restaurant was recommended by lonely planet there is no english sign so take note of the address the menu has pictures but terrible english translations the place was busy with both westerners and locals bit we walked in and were seated without a booking

we had the snow pea sprouts and bamboo appetiser eggplants pancake kung pao chicken and steamed flounder this place is certainly good value but found every single dish sweet andor oily, this restaurant is always packed with locals great place for local specialties not expensive, i have been to shanghai many times as it is one of my beloved cities its the first time i went to bao luo in march2011 though i have read many articles from gourmet magazines and websites about it reservation is mandatory as it is a local favourite and the restaurant is located in a small and old building with 2 storeys foie gras is really delicious it is served cold as appetizer with a tinge of chinese wine the dishes are authentic shanghai cuisine i would definitely go there again, this place is for those who are not afraid of experimenting and wish to get to know better a different culture
if you dont know chinese you will find the restaurant by the street number
after a small waiting area you pass by many little aquariums containing live creatures and finally reach a bigger crowded room with lots of round and square tables with no particular decor apart the crystal chandeliers
the menu is translated into a very enigmatic kind of english that recalls more magic spells than actual dishes so you will soon start to look at pictures and peek to other peoples plates
we had green beans spicy prawns you have to eat them whole after biting off the head pork belly kun pao chicken and were very satisfied the portions are big i read that their specialty were also some kind of lamb pancakes but we were not able to find them in the menu
despite of the ban many guests heavily smoke and this is the only negative aspect but this can happen often in china, i went to this restaurant as it was rated highly in fodors i was somewhat disapppointed i didnt find anything special about it most especially the atmosphere which was more like a mess hall and the food just ok a fabulous buy for the money with great atmosphere and food as well as value  also listed in fodors  was was the nepali kitchen on julu road, there is a reason why baoluo is always full of guests and enjoy very high rate in the locals community  reall reall tasty local shanghai food with a incredibly reasonable price eating in baoluo will be a little bit noisy for some people since people chatting pretty loud and sometimes you will find people smoking but if you really love food bao luo will be a must try

136,"the donping lu location has been closed again for sometime the last time was apparently due to a power outage on the block however the local residents service was restored but the bar stay closed for a long time they continue to show the location as being open on their website its disappointing to go all the way there to find it closed the boxing cat is nearby but only opens at 5pm monwed

the western food is limited to burgers and pizza it has other bar foods its nice for a change the pizza could be a little better with more american varieties lots of sports screens that usually show soccer or rugby need more variety such as american baseball not korean or japanese mlb should also subscribe to highlight the world series the stanly cup playoffs the super bowl most of the staff there dont really understand sports they will try to set it up if you ask but dont understand enough english to make it happen the bar tenders need more english training, good western food nice people and good prices in evenings it is very crowded and a real bar not a restaurant fortunately its not allowed anymore to smoke inside, home away from home
the waiter was verry nice to explain us all the different beers and cider available, when we went to the brewery our expectations werent particularly high having been to some excellent cocktail bars and not having high hopes for chinese beers however what we got in the end were two delicious ipas and some really great western food just like home midrange prices 80ish yuan for a pizza or nachos 98 yuan for 1l of their own brewed beers would definitely recommend for anyone wanting some decent pub food and a beer theres also some great other places in this area so worth the taxi there, took a guest in from bangkok by here last week and the place was in a state of abandonment saying closed for renovations as iflooks deader than a doornail, the food is good tried the steak pizza burger and german specialty  only the pizza was not as expected but with pizzas i prefer them authetic italian the beer is really good prices are ok and the crowd is very lively in the weekends, stopped for a late lunch the wings and pizza were great the chips and salsa were amazing the fajitas were ok beer was cold we were very happy we stopped here, normally a fine place but seems closed for renovations right now no info on the website to suggest when it might be back open on the upside if you do head there theres plenty of other cool places to walk to in the hangsheng area, shanghai brewery on dongping likely to close with the xuhui rezoning going on they continue to serve the bs glassware calling it a pint with a complaint the manager filipino dude basically told me the shanghainese are suckers and cut me off the true pint glassware they have for beer drinkers this place sucks hard avoid, we were staying at the regal international east asia hotel and this pub is about 3 blocks up the road from this hotel

the menu is not extensive but at least it was western type food we had the sausages which consisted of different types of sausages = very tasty

they brewed their own beers here and the one i had was peach wheat beer very drinkable

this was middle priced seeing there were very few places in which to find western fayre
the ambience was quite dark though there were very high tables and stoolsas i am only 52 tall i really needed a step ladder to get on the stool there were some vdry low tables and chairs obviously for the locals as they are quite short
very friendly staff all in all not a bad night a very busy pub, its a pub with its own beers and serves copious quantities of food we both ordered fish a chips there were 2 large pieces of beer battered cod and fries we could not finish it good but so much

couples were ordering the giant macon platter platter of wings quesadillas and more where are some nfl linemen to help the finish the food

back to the fish the beer batter makes for the best crust for fish and chips i had the peach weizen less sweet than expected really just a hint

it was a great change of plans when the original choice was closed, love this place for the beer food and the ambiance it can get very crowded from time to time when there is a big sport event going on, have been here many times and had many beer including the one i had last time the last one ever at this place
new glasses in the same size but with double walls so the beers were much smaller complained to the waiter and she was just rude about it well it was still a pint just changed from a british to an american pint she did confirm that the beer was smaller than it used to be much smaller but that was my problem
i have been scammed many times in china and this will not be the last but one thing is for sure when ever it happens i turn around and never return
now a lot of craft breweries have opened in shanghai so why not try a nice place that does not only want to rip you off, pros

tips
 they have happy hour before 8 pm everyday
 do not order food burger or pizza if you are too hungry and see rush during happy hour
cons
they changed size of the mug and downgraded to around 2025  for same size it is like challenging intelligence of customers p  i really dont know why they would do that if want to make money just raise the price instead of such tricks such a shame pfff
 can understand slow service and rush during happy hours but service is slow even during nonhappy hours
 inconsistent timeliness of food order  could take anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour or more, this is has been my favorite place in shanghai
but they have most recently decided to downgrade the size of their beer

after replacing their very special and beautiful beer glasses the size of the thier large beer  has gone down with 25 of the size  but same praise is maintained 
a shame to do this in a beer brewery which usually serve very good beer and good food good beer can be also found other places in shanghai if down size maintain

at sametime new beer glasses are terribel for drinking beer
sometimes one has to acknowledge a mistake and go back to the want customers wants and not become too greedy  that may cost customers, came here for their specialty beer was not disappointed food was decent but not top notch worth a try environment was nice, came here for burgers and was not disappointed better burger than many ive eaten in the states beers are reasonably priced too very happy and will definitely be back for more burgers, some local brews although they were not that much to our tastes some hoppy ipa types and weiss beers
prices high i suppose but to be expected
service was all in all quite good and i would probably go back but there seem to be a number of other good places to go in the french quarter which i would try first  probably a smaller joint, we have been here a few times with large groups the food menu is simple but with enough options that most people will find something this place is better known for its beers this is not a good place for the health conscious the food is mainly low quality pub food as with many places in shanghai you will need to be prepared to manage the staff a little and wave for attention, although the inside is smokey this place has awesome nachos and a great kids menu happy hour prices are fantastic even includes juice for the kids great neighborhoody location, the food is more to be considered as fast food but the beer is really good the location of the brewery is very good in the middle of french concession, shanghai brewery located on the corner of hengshan lu and dongping lu offers good western food at moderate prices and microbrewed beer for those not into the beersnob scene you can order a tiger or other off the shelf brew burgers are great and there is also some mexicanamerican fare available two for one and other drink specials during happy hour come before 730pm to be assured a good seat as it does pick up and get quite busy later in the evening, had a great night in here with my boyfriend and his work colleague and partner its the only place i found that sells cider which we all ended up drinking as it was so good spent a good few hours in here and saw people eating but didnt actually have food ourselves the bar has a lovely feel to it very modern and on trend theres a good selection of craft beer and cask extensive spirit menu and large global wine list would recommend, been here to watch football for the eu 2016 a lot tv screens good beer a great crowd what else would you expect for a sports event, shanghai brewery is a nice place for western food and drinks on the weekends they have brunch until 3pm but its nothing special they do start happy hour at 4pm on weekends good drink specials like large tiger draft for 28rmb food is good the flights of craft beers for 65rmb is good to sample 4 flavors i had the fish and chips and it was great nachos are huge but soggy we spent 5 hours there and it was a good time there was a line out the door when we left so if you are coming on a friday or saturday night you will be waiting, shanghai brewery is playing games with their glassware and pricing i had a large pint for 52rmb and i highly doubt its a 16 oz pour see photo new glassware with a thick double wall that shrinks the actual volume of beer in the glass

to get a decent sized beer you now get to pay 92 yuan holy hannah

go elsewhere, if you like the crowd loud music sports bar then this is the place for you service slow mainly when crowded bar food , they down sized their beers go some
place else maybe boxing cat beer guys want a real pint the glass they show in the add isnt anymore, they used to serve a real pint they now have gone cheap only serve baby beers i will now go to boxing cat, i have been to both locations the bar is very good the food was exceptional taste and value it is worth the trip to try
we were able to sit outside and enjoy a leisurely brunch i had scrambled eggs with bacon a thick grilled tomato slice and a dish of beans like pork and beans  the menu seems to have a good variety and reasonable prices, i went to the shanghai brewery for a break after exploring the french concession the beer selection is really good i enjoyed the 4 sampler combo and nachos with minced beef which were awesome for dinner maybe a little bit pricy, not the best beer but quite good and some nice options the decor was good too woody brassy nice beer hall atmosphere the staff were decent some speak english the pizza was not great wouldnt get it again and we didnt try other foods the issue was that they allow smoking everywhere as does just about every chinese restaurant or bar so you cant sit anywhere and not breath in lots of smoke  which kills the taste of the beer, stopped by for lunch while walking around it was fairly empty and the service was quick we were impressed by the nice variety of their own beers and the six different beers we tried were very good in addition we ordered the hummus as an appetizer and burgers and they did not disappoint they were perfectly cooked and the flavors hit the spot, we had been to the other branch and decided to try this one out too the happy ours prices for the craft beer were really good roughly 3 dollars for a beer cheaper than most places sell carlsberg and bud in china and the craft brew is much better the food was good too this place also shows sports on tv its a place that i could go back to repeatedly if i lived in shanghai, a good idea for a lazy afternoon during the chinese new year period however not even their expansive beer range could save the overall experience from average to a very good rating their own brews are excellent food decent but the service was slow and indifferent dining with friends each of our meals came out at different timesthe lady being 25 minutes after the first deliveryreally that needs improving, came to this place twice during a 5day stay in shanghai tried the craft beer sampler and then began to sip on the craft pilsner from then on the beverages arent cheap here but they are well worth it considering comparable bars in shanghai will charge nearly the same price for a glass of budweiser as for the foods every dish i tried was pretty good id recommend the nacho platter for a fast easy and tasty appetizer also this place was comfortablypacked with people on both sunday night as well as tuesday night would come back here every day, the brewery is located in the pedestrian walk the downstairs has a pool table and the large number of televisions that you would expect in a sports bar

ordered dinner starting with the calamari for the starter and the chicken quesadilla for the main all the food was served at one time even though it was clear that the calamari was the starter

the quesadilla was a bit burned tough and very oily would definitely try something different

plenty of beer offerings which was good

in total would i return probably not can find many places that serve a wide variety of beers but serve better food

the waitress was the strangest i have encountered in a long time she was quite entertaining to say the least but still not enough reason to return, this is the second shanghai brewery to have been opened this venue is far superior to the origininal on hongmei road the service is good and the food is good, beautiful bar  2 floors with one for smoking and 2nd for nonextensive beer selection and huge expat population bar was full of lively ppl dancing even on a rainy wed night would def go back, i was at an indian restaurant just around the corner saffron and ended up at shanghai brewery for a few pints afterwards for being in china this is a pretty typical pub atmosphere that you would find anywhere in the world its a higher end spot not exactly budget but high quality and good service they have plenty of bar food to keep you busy and lots of big television screens playing anything from football to cricket to rugby if i lived in shanghai i would be here every night, enjoyed my visit here and their locally brewed beer the food was just ok i enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was very good its a nice break if visiting shanghai, music is good and atmosphere pleasant the beer is decent and you can enjoy your time there nothing special in terms of food but you can find the classics, the wait staff and even manager are extremely rude and apathetic towards patrons

i was especially shocked as i went there on a monday night when most bars in shanghai such as blue frog have a bogo special on burgers so the place was half empty as they dont offer this special  i asked to sit at one of the high tables of which 4 were totally available and they said no as i was only a party of 2 they seat up to 6 even though i told them i would share it if more people came and it got crowded they still refused insisting i sit at one of the low tables again it was half empty and mondays are generally slow as i didnt want to sit at one if the low tables i simply left and went to the camel  a five minute walk away where service was far better

this isnt the first time ive experienced horrific customer service here but it will be the last as i dont plan on returning i even posted the experience on wechat social media and was surprised to find that i am not alone in experiencing bad service from this restaurantbar and also not alone in no longer being a patron of the establishment

when paying us $8+ for a beer and $1520 for a food dish i do have an expectation from wait staff and the service level offered especially as there are so many options in the immediate area  and better craft beer choices not far away

if they keep up with the chinese level of service they likely wont last more than another year or two, this place is easy to find just a 10 minute walk from hengshan road metro station very quiet on a monday afternoon good pub food burgers mexican etc all the beers we tried were good they also have an outdoor seating area if its not too hot to sit outside, nice place you can sit out 1st floor smoking and 2nd floor non smoking
they serve full menu until 11 pm then only burgers and starters
we sat there for 2 nights enjoyed the big kahuna burger the seafood platter the drinks and more humus not so good pizza also suffers from poor quality cheese, if you are looking for typical bar food this is the place good beers wings and other items pizza wasnt the best, the chinese staff had zero respect for customers they were rude obnoxious and aggressive this was the worst barrestaurant experience ive ever had the food was just about okay and the beer i tried was very poor it was all overpriced my advice  there are many places to go around hengshan lu where the staff have some respect for people, the chinese staff had zero respect for customers the worst barrestaurant experience ive ever had  so rude obnoxious and aggressive the food was just about ok but very overpriced my advice  there are plenty of other places to go to around hengshan lu with more authentic atmospheres and staff that have some respect for other people, i lived just around the corner from the brewery for almost 2 years and i couldnt tell you how many times i was in there great craft beers brewed onsite some of the best wings ive ever had i still compare ever wing ive tried to the ones in shanghai brewery
great place to people watch while enjoying some great beers, amazing service and very fast at serving food definitely a great place to finish the day and take in the evening in the french concession great variety of beer that helped wash out the terrible taste from the bund brewery earlier in the day food was excellent as well and everything was very reasonably priced","Turkish cuisine",0.999789396849042

we ordered a first round of drinks and they came out quickly but after that the experience went downhill pretty quickly there appeared to be two staff in the front of the house managerowner type and waiter managerowner type sat down to chat with a table of guests and left waiter to handle the restaurant on his own there were three other tables in the whole restaurant and we got ignored for the rest of the night waiter couldnt figure out what whiskey and soda was in english or chinese each food item was delivered 20 minutes apart and my glass stayed empty for most of the 2 hours it took for all the food to finally come out

in short i feel like i spent a lot of money ~700 rmb for inattentive service and drinks made by someone who wasnt trained how to make them when your empty plate is just sitting there and your glass is empty and the place isnt crowded something has gone pretty wrong id recommend one of the many alternatives in the area, thoroughly enjoyed the pasta and the buratta cheese with ham was amazing service was a little slow but we had a pretty large group each dish was well prepared and delicious  no complaints here, really enjoyed our evening at luccios  solid italian menu quaint setting reasonably priced owner came out to personally check and see how our meal was going if your kids are well behaved luccios is kidfriendly mine enjoyed the authentic pizzas on the menu and the fresh breads 100 chance we will return, the food selection is wide enough but without excess risking the quality the selection of mixed appetizers is the best being 34 people then the main courses are very good both for pastas rices o steak, i was looking for something outside of the crowded and over priced xintiandi area luccios is a short walk away and definitely much more peaceful the service is good and the wine choices are reasonably priced and excellent in taste the menu offers a nice selection of pasta meats salads etc i started with a glass of red wine and a salad that was accompanied by a basket of small rolls with olive oil  balsamic i then chose a nice steak and finished off with creme brulee the owner was very nice and chatted but not to the point of intruding i will definitely be back when i return in april, the problem with going out for dinner in shanghai is that your favourite spot can be amazing one evening and then appalling the next no so at luccios the service is consistent and friendly the food comes out when ready unrushed so one can linger for a couple of hours enjoying dinner in the italian style

the wine list highlights wonderful italian wines the kitchen is consistent with solid appetizing italian food the head waitress speaks good english and is attentive to patrons the manager when he is in makes a point of making regulars feel like old friends stopping around for dinner

my personal recommendation is tuna tartar as an appetizer for a main i always end up with the pizza quatro staggione i went to luccios recently with a very picky friend and she was impressed by the fine thin crust on her proscuiotto pizza if she likes the food you can be assured that it is of very high quality

on sundays luccios does a relaxed brunch with a prosecco option i spent my birthday here and was again treated like an old friend with generous pours, the owner of this italian restaurant is a british specialist of wines but he selected an excellent italian chef then the food has a typical italian taste the room is small but warm and the personnel provides a kind treatment, located on a quiet road very close to xin tian di luccios is a regular lunch stop off for friends and i good place to catch up with people or just relax with a coffee and watch the world go by

good news is that have also just opened an additional location in jingan at yanping and wuding  food is great there too just had dinner with the family, this italian is superb great flavour and situated in a lovely neighboured with plenty of restaurants around but this one is really good great italian delicacies , great italian meal of pizza and pasta sometimes you need an escape from the local food and this is an escape the food is delicious the service is friendly and fast and the location convenient
give it a go you will not be dissapointed, its hard to find genuine italian great pizza  appropriate size pasta and delicious  loved it well be back ps great house made icecream, trying to find good quality western food in china can be a struggle i found this place after reading reviews from trip advisor and i am glad i did the environment was good food was good and the wine was good the owner is a british guy and was very welcoming when i go to shanghai again i will go here, we had a great time at luccios its not located in the tourist xintiadi but jus a few meters away on a nice typical shanghai street

the food was great specially the pizzas dont forget to try the wine the ratio pricequality was amazing

also the italian owner really seems to care about his guests and makes sure they have a good time we sure did, nice restaurante the italian food is like you were in italy a little expensive but very good enviroment i will go back for sure, i visited luccios in jingan the new one finally i can eat real italian food after 2 years in shanghai trying many restaurants i can say this one is my favourite italian food place meatballs are just amazing pasta al dente every food i ordered the 2 times i have been was perfect the service very nice and helpful i will recomend, i had dinner with a group of 8 at the restaurant and it was a very nice evening the atmosphere was great the food absolutely incredible as was the 4 wines 3 red and a white and grappa we had a 4 course meal of appetizers pastas main course of meat and fish and deserts it is an elegant place and i would recommend for business or an evening with friends or as a couple, we where not disappointed i choose the restaurant based on fellow trip advisor reviews ive been coming to shanghai for 15 years and after many lunches and dinners it great to get some western food

the idea of small of the main tourist strip appealed and surprised my guest

the food service and wine selection was great and we enjoyed a selection of dishes to share

the only dish that let down the meal was the calamari which was tasteless and over cooked everything else from cold cuts salads pasta steak lamb was excellent

id definitely return, a couple of years ago i started to visit shanghai again more regularly only to find my usual italian restaurant close to the hotel had closed a glance through tripadvisor put me on to luccios and im really glad it did

i have now visited this little gem of a restaurant many times and taken many of my friends and colleagues to enjoy the good food and wine this eatery is located on a small treelined street along with other cafes which adds to its charm inside the restaurant is small but with enough space for you to feel far enough apart from your immediate neighbour the menu is not extensive i quite like this as it usually means that ingredients are fresh and this shows when it comes to the eating the wine is reasonably priced and the owner paul visits wineyards in italy to procure some interesting and good tasting tipples

the whole experience is rounded off by the owners excellent welcome and his friendly manner this has rubbed off on pauls staff too who do their best to ensure a pleasant dining experience in a friendly atmosphere

luccios is now my choice for an italian meal in shanghai, the food wine and beer were all wonderful the local knowledge given in english was great a true oasis for tourists who want to relax eat well drink well in a relaxing environment, try to find this excellent italian eatery near the french concession we were invited off the street by a gentleman who ended up being our very good waiter edward table near the street allowed for great people watching while we enjoyed an authentic italian meal chef was trained by venetian who left this kitchen in great hands we enjoyed a subtle asparagus risotto seared tuna salad soup pasta with fresh pesto and wonderful white wine evoo on table miraculously fresh cant wait to come back and try several other menu items we saw pass by our table, we came to luccios without eating the entire day the warm welcoming of paul was exactly what we needed after couple few seconds we have bread and bear on the table and also starters came soon food was excellent and surprisingly in shanghai here you get also good wine i have visited shanghai over then years minimum once a year and be so happy to find such a nice place with delicious food and homely service i definetly will visit here on my forthcoming trips in shanghai thank you paul hopkins see you next time, surprising to find an authentically european style italian restaurant in this location seem to be more bars than restaurants here

the welcome was great with a very friendly and warm team especially paul hopkins the food was really good tasty and nicely presented starters perfectly cooked ribeye and an excellent steak tartare the wine list was extensive and we had a good bottle of chianti at a reasonable pricewill definitely come back soon to try some of the classic italian dishes, tucked in a nice side street in xintiandi filled with several wine bars
food is simple but well prepared i had carpaccio and pasta both of them were nice and visibly from fresh ingredients
however the best thing about this restaurant is the friendly atmosphere dining room is relatively small and ones feels like at home i was alone on business trip and found nicer than the more predictable places in the vicinity, in my experience this is the best italian in shanghai the pizza was very good and the risotto porcini was very tasty nice experience i strongly recommend it if you like italian food, for those nights you really just crave a western meal this is the place the food is quite tasty and well presented the service was discrete yet perfect dont forget to check out the beautiful art on the walls the location is convenient too easy to arrive by subway or taxi, went there with an italian friend on a saturday night had a few appetizers and then a pasta dish neither one of them was truly italian more like a foreigner trying to cook italian

the food was ok but not great i wouldnt go back, we have eaten here three times and have never been disappointed the owner makes sure you have a wonderful and memorable experience from beginning to end the food iis very good and the atmosphere cozy and inviting the staff are superb we will visit again, i visited luccios for the second time this past weekend with several friends we we all quite impressed with the food we had a set menu and really just went with what the owner brought to our table and we were not disappointed we started with a very nice cesar salad home made pizza pappardelle with bacon meatball spaghetti with cherry tomatoes and stracciatella strip loin regrettably we didnt leave room for desert there are a lot of interesting things on the menu that will take me back again to try out

the service was great too paul the owner is friendly attentive and welcoming, walked by one morning and decided to have lunch turned out to be a cozy and friendly little restaurant they said they are very busy thursday through friday so reservation is recommended give it a try a short walk away from the fancy xintiandi hangouts, we stumbled upon luccios on heavy rain evening and were delightful about interior simple but nice and the menu even though it is on the expensive side the owner itself set us down took our orders it was really nice and i was preparing myself for the italian delight in the middle of shanghai

unfortunately my pasta was just average even though cooked al dente the taste was pretty uninventive and would not go back to it especially considering the price

they have this odd custom of not getting everything on the table at once but one meal after another so we cannot eat at the same time, we had a great evening at luccios where we were welcome nicely had a choice between two tables and were served very professionally the prices are in line with what they offer and so are the drinks all main dishes were very nice risotto pasta pizza and looked fresh and well arranged on the plates the decor of the place is also pleasant and the music played comfortable
for the desert we have to give a big minus as the menu points out the homemade offers and the chef obviously he had a bad day as everybody knows that the biscuits in tiramisu have to be soaked in coffee and this was not the case but they were hard on top there has to be some amaretto in there so we had a good espresso with it but for 50 rmb do not go for it pity, during a lunch with some friends we started with a pizza to share and then i had asparagus risotto as a main course the pizza was delicious  very thin crust and amazingly flavourful tomato sauce the risotto was very well cooked  a little toothsome and nicely creamy  but i would have liked a stronger asparagus flavour
the service was friendly and comfortable and the restaurant was not too busy for a saturday afternoon i would go back especially to try to weekday lunchtime special, i have been to luccios two times for lunch the set lunch of two courses plus a soft drink or house wine is 88rmb the house wine is quite good compared to most house wines offered in shanghai the pasta is perfectly done and the seasoning is not too over powering i look forward to trying the pizza the next time i go, luccio�s is a great example of shanghai�s cosmopolitan culture � an italian restaurant opened in a chinese city by an englishman with two chefs from milan and the result works very well it�s located in xiantandi on a small side street that still maintains some local character and the interior decor is clean and uncluttered paul the english owner travels to france and italy to personally select the wine list so the labels and bottles are not the usual ones imported in bulk to china we had a very good blended cabernet sangiovese and merlot from a small vineyard in bolgheri for less than 200rmb which as locals will know is a bargain in shanghai because of the high taxes on imported wines but what of the food  the welcome basket of different breads baked on the premises was a very good start and the two chefs both named giacomo know what they�re doing we lived in milano for a few years so we were interested to see how luccio�s would incorporate traditional dishes and local tastes the appetisers were a good example � a delicious tuna tartare with guacamole that took a milanese staple and added a mexican twist and burrata served with parma ham  both of very high quality and also delicious the main courses were a cotaletta milanese and a rack of lamb � the famous cotaletta is usually a veal chop but pork was substituted in luccio�s which meant the thin beaten and breaded chop was a little drier than usual but still good the rack of lamb turned out to be two lamb cutlets small and undercooked which was the only disappointment of the evening we followed with a classic chocolate souffle and espresso coffee and decided to walk home when we could get out of our chairs it was a very good evening, luccios is a new italian restaurant that recently opened in the xintiandi area fellow expats had recommended that we stop by and give it a try we arrived early good as we did not have reservations and ordered a couple dishes including the eggplant parmesan which was baked ramekin style tasty along with two different risottos  wild mushroom risotto and asparagus risotto the asparagus version was well cooked light and flavorful the wild mushroom version was tasty with the help of beef broth however we were not sure if they rinsed the mushrooms as each spoonful had a sand like taste which did not make the experience very good for dessert we had the nougat semifreddo small buttery and not sure i would order it again along with a cappuccino good but prefer the costa coffee cappuccino and cheaper additionally the homemade hot bread was good dipped in olive oilbalsamic vinegar was good and the wine was not bad either overall the food was average and expensive service was very slow we were there two hours note if you plan on stopping by we recommend that you make reservations also the restaurant is located on danshui road a very local local street but the restaurant is small quaint and simply decorated smack in the middle of the street","vegetarian restaurant",0.999823946561825
139,"if you dont mind a typical fine dining experience with a+ flavors but very small portions and a large bill then you will love this place if youre like us who live on a budget and like to leave satiated then you will want to avoid this restaurant we paid the same price at wolfgang pucks at lunchtime and received just as good food with 5 times the portions also we made a reservation online and it was never made clear to us that there is the small barrestaurant downstairs and the larger one upstairs so we ended up at the small one apparently the menus are different in each placethey were nice enough though to allow me to order the crab cakes from upstairs since thats what i had my heart on after reading the reviews all in all we probably wont be returning but others may like it just fine, my first impression of goga from the outset right after stepping out from the taxi was a little skeptical

this little restaurant doesnt look like much at first looks like a takeaway kebab shop from the outside but as soon as we stepped in we were warmly welcomed by the friendly host and shown to our table in this tiny restaurant

although the menu is not extensive everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and the food exceeded all of our expectations portion size was great prices are reasonable given the very high standard we will be back for more

highly recommended dishes my favorites are sashimi chicken salad stuffed chicken in thai curry lobster roll and probably more when im back next

mama mia, weve been living in china for more than 4 years already and goga is still one of the favorite places to go tiny restaurant but thats probably the only minus oh and also the fact that they dont accept cards yeahyeah cash only
but the food is super yummy i love their sauces and dressings every time like a firework in your mouth
give it a try if you are in shanghai
enjoy, met our son and fiance who live in shanghai who brought us herefantastic food especially the salads and the crab cakes were to die forthe owner went out of his way for us and everything about this place was great, small restaurant of about 12 seating so reservation is good idea the chef really seems to care to make the experience nice the personal touch and superior meal was worth the somewhat high prices, we lived in shanghai for four years and goga was a mainstay a small lovely place with an excellent menu and very good personal service we are from san francisco and this is pretty much the only place in town that reminded us of home the menu changes seasonally dont be afraid to sit at the counter chef shared his pumpkin soup recipe with us and we make it at home, shanghai has a lot of nice restaurants though its often overpriced this one however is outstanding and unique in shanghai

the food is super delicious but not super expensive they serve kind of fusion of western and asian cuisine with a twist i went there frequently and my favourites are the lobster roll and the ribeye its feelgoodfood that you wont find anywhere else in shanghai its not just a ribeye its rubbed with their homemade seasoning and served with duck
fat  roasted potatoes so good also the chicken salad is just great

the fantastic food is served in a casual atmosphere its a small place maybe 20 seats so you should book a table it looks a little bit like a food shack but in a very good way the service is nice and welcoming and the chef is always up for a bit chatting if you visit shanghai and want to have something special you should go there definitely, goga is a tiny little place in the french concessionreservations are highly recommended if youre trying to get a seat during peak hours i went on a thursday at 6pm and it was not too crowded but seating is very limited so on a friday or saturday there will definitely be a wait the food is tapas style fusion small portions to share with friends but not too small i tried the lobster rolls awesome braised beef cheeks awesome and the pork belly so tender the waitstaff does a great job lining up the plates so that they all arrive in sequence at the pace youre eating so there is no big pile up on the small tables and i did not feel rushed im not sure what happens durning peak hours but it was very relaxing and enjoyable give it a try, went to goga on a week night with a friend the menu is small but has a variety of options that are all served sharing style they dont have much for drinks but will make you something from their other restaurant upstairs i recommend the pork belly as its always tasty, wonderful food at this eatery on yueyang lu every dish has wonderful flavors from asia mexico and north america brad turley is still one of the best chefs in shanghai, excellent little eatery that serves up some delicious seafood dishes pricey but worth it for special occasions, and a great selection of wine and food that is sure to please everyone hard to find yes but worth the effort the main restaurant is on the roof not the street when you arrive you will see the small goga on the street walk behind it to the lobby and up the elevator to the 7th floor best to make reservations on the weekend service was great and the owner made is way around to each table to check on everyone and thank them for coming a bit pricey and they only take cash so bring your roll of 100 rmb notes, we were recommended to go here by a friend who is living in shanghai now and local knowledge is always a good thing she told us where it was and told us to go to the roof restaurant and to the one on the street if we couldnt get into the roof
the street restaurant was easy to find however the roof restaurant you need to walk around the back and go into the building and catch the lift to the 7th floor we always like to sit outside and it was a lovely night to do so
food was great we had pork belly done very differently sliders and a lovely crab salad
would definitely return, goga offers some great american fusion dishes that are brilliantly created by the chef my favourite dishes include the sea urchin on crostini the tuna tataki the salmon salad and especially the kampachi ceviche with yuzu and white truffle oil dishes are in tapassize and great with wine although the place is small my friends and i really enjoyed taking the bar seats where we could see all their actions in the kitchen i look forward to seeing their wine list being expanded at my next visit, i had a fantastic time on the roof top the view over the city at night was great along with the food and brad the owner passed but the table for a chat, its a small restaurant last time we didnt manage to get in despite making a reservation after many months i forgave them and tried again

good food good service and a very tolerant staff we stayed a long time after the closing time were the backdrop to a memorable evening, chefowner brad does a fantastic job here his food is exceptional i would say this is one of my top 5 restaurants in shanghai been going there for at least 5 years and several times per year never disappoints, goga is a tiny restaurant in the middle of the french concession a few of our friends whove lived in shanghai recommended it we went there before heading back to the airport so we were a little early and got there about 20 minutes before they open the stuff greeted us warmly and didnt have any problem we the fact we got there so early

it did give us the pleasure of having the whole stuff for ourselves at least until other guests started to arrive at about 7 the waiter was very helpful and friendly his recommendations were excellent

all the 6 dishes we tried were great most notable was the lobster roll an amazing dish

overall we had a great experience in goga, we came here as goga was recommeded as one of the best californian restaurants after tried our theres a huge disappointment and please let me take the advantage to clarify food wasnt truly californian style all dishes could be made in any other casual western restaurants you pay for the feeling who just some pictures hang on the wall
service was pretty slow and we have to call for the waiter at any stages we need
it was a disaster go and try if you dont trust, had the company dinner here the menu was a big confusion we dont know what is the better way to order a couples of food to share a mixed international and asian food someone came and explained that normally they dont suggest the guest for that but everything is perfect
we ordered 5 different things and 3 portions on each perhaps only the chicken was ok and the rest were tasteless service had a big problem of attitude hence thats the common issues in shanghai while the dinner was finished up we changed our mind to have after drinks somewhere else, reservations are a must in this small restaurant we enjoyed a tataki sashimi and a steak dish that were delightfully presented and delicious its not the best for romance since its small and tables are close together but the food is outrageously good the service was friendly and good i would return, visiting a friend she brought me to this very tiny fusion restaurant cosy and the staff was friendly many delicious options on the menu the rib eye steak with truffle was amazing as was also the red snapper and octopus salad a taste sensation in every bite i want to go again to try out all dishes, goga is the sort of restaurant you have to keep going back to the food is wonderful great flavour combination and good portions the place is tiny and very welcoming with a great atmosphere just one word of advice its cash only, this is a very small restaurant run by a american chefred snapper is my favorite but other fusion food also very goodservice is attentive and waiters are politedefinitely come back, goga is one of our favourite locals we eat there on average once every two weeks as the food has been consistently excellent and the staff becomes even lovelier with each visit ingredients taste fresh and our taste buds have yet to be disappointed i can recommend all the fish dishes as i have tried them all my favourite two being the kampachi and the salmon salad there are also other meat options but i only eat fish though i hear fellow diners say how delicious the meat dishes are the restaurant is very cosy seating less than 20 indoors with upstairs terrace seating for the warmer months if you do not like being in close proximity with your fellow diners this is not for you due to the cosy nature of the space there are two seatings 630pm and 830pm so advance booking is highly recommended, really good dinner not actually as expensive as i thought it would be as i currently live in shenzhen around 800rmb for starters main and wine for two, visiting a few times each year this place continues to provide consistency in flavor and service serious attention to execution of course a very quaint and attention to details from staff and head waiter charles

miss having dillon at helm but the current full local chefs did very well in execution tonight

starters all done well octopus salad could have less dressing so ask for it light cod was always executed perfect ribeye flavor excellent but requested medium was cooked like medium rare

simple considerations easy adjustments for a 5 star experience

thanks to the team at goga for always a good experience helps remind us of our former west coast flavors and style of service, went here twice this year once in the summer when it was fabulous and once a few days ago dec 14 when unfortunately it was only soso atmosphere had not changed still nice and intimate as well as laid back staff trying their best to be efficient and professional but something was lacking food had lots of potential but unfortunately three out of the four dishes we had were simply too oily  greasy which let the whole thing down considerably i dont know whether it had anything to do with it but when we went in the summer a young american was heading the kitchen and clearly had a firm hand on everything i would have not liked to be working under him but he clearly delivered was cracking on a personal level and the staff were all extremely on their toes in the best possible way  he was not here when we went last so maybe thats where the change has come from as this is not a cheap place rmb600+ for four dishes and two drinks i can only give it three stars for now hoping it will pick itself up again and return to its old days of glory, i heard talk about this place so with some friends we went there
i tried some plates from menu
the most disappoint was main course meat dry and tasteless
the service was disasterno one care about uslooks like we have to leave because they want close
overall bad experience, when you eat here youll ask yourself how does the chef make this food taste so good the food is rich in flavor and the ambience is cozy i always look forward to eating here the only problem is they dont take credit cards, i decided to visit this restaurant after i checked the trip advisor chart my expectations was quite high unfortunately it was not the best experience of my life but the opposite the environment of the restaurant is really poor staff service unprofessional i order arancini its one of my favorite italian street food but the taste was not good was not fried properly i order halibut fish the texture was really chewy the short rib was ok

overall the place didnt match my expectations, had an absolutely fantastic meal here the venue is a bit tight to say the least but that adds to the experience sat at the bar and talked to the chef the chefowner came down from the other restaurant and spoke to us and was just wonderful only two seatings at this venue but definitely worth giving it a go sometime we were offered mussels for free and i have never liked the smell of them before but i had multiple helpings of these quiet delicious, love the delicious food by the famous brad turley located near donping lu which is great for an evening stroll and perfect for a evening with friends or clients order the tuna tataki they are also participants of chi fan for charity organized by austen morris associates contact the organizer to host, this place blew my mind my friend who has spent 7 years living in shanghai took me to this restaurant and now i know why the chef is from california and clearly knows what he is doing he came around to the tables multiple times which was really cool and gave us a chance to talk ask questions and get to know him they even had some kitchen troubles but it didnt prove to be an issue the food was still killer we ordered the asian chicken salad scallops seared beef seared tuna and red snapper and ate these courses over a few bottles of wine simply delicious, went on a monday night and for once the place was empty dont count on it though so better reserve

really enjoyed the food which is really one of the best in shanghai staying in a reasonable budget, goga is small restaurant but ambiance is nice  u feel like at home menu has many option  service attentive and staff polite sure come back again, the best dinner so far goga has great menu and friendly staffof u would like to have great dinner no hesitate to come here soon come back again, chef brad is originally from california and has spent a lot of time working at restaurants in asia  his food reflects his native california with asian flair and flavors some of the dishes are on the spicier side of mild but not excessively so  all were delicious goga is a smaller space worth sampling if you cannot get a table at hai by goga next door on 7th floor of the hotel i will definitely go back on my next trip to shanghai, we went to goga based on their reviews we were disappointed by both the food  especially the very poor service we were seated  then forgotten about there were four people working that we could see  there are only a handful of tables so rather than forgotten i guess we were just ignored we werent the only table with that issue we had to ask someone twice to come take our drink order  then had to ask for someone to take our food order on top of the poor service we found the food to be pretty tasteless maybe they were having an off night we wouldnt go back, lots of friends recommended me goga everyone was telling me its the best restaurant theyve been in shanghai it turned out the worst ive been

the only positive part of my dinner was the service i can say that waiters are very kind and pay attention to when you finish your dish and will promptly change dishes before bringing the next course

i asked recommendations to the waiter and picked dishes from those he suggested i had the tuna which was very salty the steak which was not tender at all and you could only taste pepper it felt like they put the all bottle of pepper on the meat as main i ordered the back cod with miso again a but too salty and the worst part is that they added coriander on it which i hate now i know there are lots of people who love coriander but at the same time there are people who hate it so a good restaurant should either write it in the menu or ask if you want it

the bill was expected expensive but i wouldnt have minded spending these money off the good was worth a huge disappoint from this famous restaurant do not go really not for the money but as there are so many good restaurants in shanghai

dessert i decided to skip it before wasting more money and preferred to treat myself with a good lemon  lemon tart at mmb, 14 seats in the dining room and the charm to match we had capers as an appetizer then salmon salad and miso cod as mains wow exceptionally prepared  delicious reasonablypriced california wines available which we appreciated ownerchef along with the entire staff was quite friendly we will definitely return, tiny tiny restaurant but almost deliver the best food to all customers seems its a chef is american their food is a bit asian eu and american cash only, a wonderful place amazong terrace really lovely i had an aperitive only but it was really great the chef super kind i really advice to go, goga stands for golden gate bridge home town of chef and owner
been there many times and its one of the few restaurant where i will over order over eat and still have no guilt as its so so good the price is reasonable too cant ask for more
i will readily admit that even when im there with my wife we will order at least 4 starters followed by mains and sometimes desert
the scallops fish carpaccio lobster sliders are must try for starters the steak and codfish for mains are great actually i must have tried everything on the menu and its all good
the wine list is simple but very reasonable priced and is a pleasant surprise in todays world
bit of advise reservation is a must especially if you have a group the original space is tight they have an extension in the building beside it but have not tried theres an outdoor area on the 2nd thats great for spring and autumn so you can ask for that specifically too and dont be late
highly recommend, if you want a casual and intimate evening in a place that serves exceptional quality and service please dont miss this very good restaurant

took us 5 years to visit but the food reminds us of some of the best influences of the pacific northwest and california from which we are originally from
dont be shy to speak to the chef de cuisine of the night they will engage you and tell you more about their passions chef dillon was able to make us feel right a home

the fish highlight the freshness of the menu and would suggest taking time to endulge on the starters octopus salad is made so well with a well macerated octopus and seasoned to perfection

dont forget the chocolate mousse there are some fantastic surprises on the bottom of the cup

great work goga, goga is consistently able to deliver excellent quality the materials are fresh and the cooking is excellent it is not a classical chinese restaurant as such  more of a modern restaurant with uncompromising approach to quality and the use of both chinese and imported produce
if you stick with the daily dishes the pricing is moderate if you go for the specials it is still a good deal  even the price will be substantially higher
the service is excellent and if you have a special wish just take it up with the chef  he is right there
the tables on the rooftop are absolutely my favorite
if you are really in a party mode it is a short walk from goga down to shanghai brewery for a really good microbrewery beer to cap off an excellent evening, restate the facts goga is small gogas menu is also on the small side for slightly larger of both try the sister restaurant hai by goga which is 100 meters away on the top of a hotel that said oh my gosh the food is consistently excellent i have eaten here 20 times and never been disappointed with the food maybe because it is so rare in shanghai but the lobster roll just hits the spot every time brad turley is the chef big jovial guy in the hawaiian shirt and he is a master his fish preparations both sashimi and cooked are great the crispy chicken heaven mix this with reasonably priced bottles of wine and goga always makes for a great evening oh yeah cash only and make a reservation, im really enjoy their food and nice service in goga such a good restaurant, the smells the food and the food are spectacular try the crab cakes and the scallops you will not be disappointed, we are really not sure how anyone can state that this place provides the best food in shanghai as it fall far from this in our recent experience there were 3 of us and the first shock is the size of the place only 6 tables in the place that we could see the menu had a very very limited range of 5 or 6 starters and main with just 2 deserts the starter we chose lobster roll and the tuna were exceptionally good for the main course we had snapper which was ok but nothing outstanding and due to the exceptionally limited menu we had 2 t bone steaks we specifically asked about the quality of the meat and were told that it came from australia so we hoped for something tasty and special but what a disaster the sauce was over salted and the meat was so tough it was almost impossible to eat and was so fatty we had to leave about 2030 of it we had a bowl of fried new potatoes with some bacon pieces and mushroom all this for the price of rmb 390 us$ 6200 it was outrageous and one of the worst cuts of meat we have experienced in over 12 years in shanghai it makes us wonder where the meat really came from there is a choice of only 2 desserts which seems rather pathetic but they were tasty so we really dont know what all the excitement is about with this place the wine was fine as were the starters but forget the steak then we all have to pay by cash which is rather surprising in a place like this if you go here then stay with the starters and deserts but honestly spoken the reviews stating how wonderful the food is from our experience are over rating this place","dumpling restaurant",0.803148542733045
14,"designed equally delicious with its food tried both locations in shanghai and true enough both location had a perfect blend of ambiance and great food in one place the first time i have tried yunnan food and my palette was certainly please, ive been to shanghai for work and play many times and eaten in some fab restaurants on the bund and elsewhere and lost heaven is my new fave we skipped the wine in favour of green tea as many locals would we started with taro spring rolls burmese crab cakes and yunnan ham pancake all amazing and not a crumb left we followed with burmese tea leaves salad cant describe how wickedly good this is hot and spicy tofu very spicy burmese beef curry burmese chicken curry and snow peas with lily bulbs the most delicious greens youll eat having been to burma several times and to yunnan province as well i loved the food authenticity of lost heaven and at rmb 600 for three people very reasonable and of course the moodlit interior amazing furniture and furnishings bustling vibe and attentive staff all made for a picture perfect evening and no trouble getting a cab after dinner as we were whisked to a waiting car by a lovely attendant, i love coming here when friends can me in town the service was wonderful and the spicy dishes unlike anything ive had in china nice wine selection too, our family group of experienced diners really enjoyed this restaurantits menu is extensive with a matching wine listthe english speaking waitstaff are friendly and efficient and the quality of the ingredients and cooking could not be faulted
one of the best restaurants we have been to in a long time and outstanding value with a quiet and colourful ambience, im struggling to think of a way to fault this place i guess the only thing we complained about during the course of the night was that it was so moodlit we could barely see who we were talking to but it was all part of the ambience the only other thing anyone raised their voice about was that it was too cold the air con was blasting and right near us and when they noticed us complaining about this they actually went and turned it down for us

the waiters spoke decent english they were prompt and responsive the kitchen waittimes for meals was unbelievably quick every single meal and we made sure to tick off the poultry pork seafood veg and entree boxes was astoundingly good and the menu had a very broad selection of dishes

the drinks were also incredible i dont recall the last time i had such a delightful singapore sling cocktail not even in singapore

a touch on the pricey side but not if you consider its proximity to the bund and the prices that most medium to highend restaurants are changing

definitely visit oh and book ahead, when you think about chinese restaurant  this is the picture you have in mind absolutely beautiful good to impress visiting people fulfilled by foreigners quite pricy for shanghai standards but the quality and the location require it food was tasty and cocktail well prepared i loved lamb samousa, we were really looking forward to this meal after reading the reviews we loved what we saw the minute we walked in so much charm and elegance the wait staff was wonderful trying their best to communicate in english our waitress was honest and told us that we should order one less dish as we had too much food the appetisers came out together and were both impressive followed by 2 lovely and unique main dishes, we had dinner in this restaurant on the 6th of march  which was recommended to us by the concierge of our hotel in wa shanghai on the bund
you need to make a booking as it gets completely full at night and very convenient for guests staying in wa as you only have to cross the road to get to it
it was a yunnan cuisine worth trying
the ambiance was very nice and quite a huge restaurant bustling with guests
unfortunately for us did not have too much of a choice of variety because not the meat not halal and even the vegetarian items like soup were made in chicken stock
the waitress was kind in making for us a special vegetarian soup with vegan stock
we ordered a prawn dish which was not bad too
the service was good although very busy restaurant and price was reasonable for the type of restaurant, very interesting flavours in chinese cuisine less known to westerners restaurant is great looking with an overall red decor though be prepared for noise which makes the experience somewhat less relaxing and intimate service is good would gladly return, very nice ambience very good variety of yunnan province food the food quality is quite good as well as the course looking service has been fast to mention the rest room ambience is quite unique, lost heaven is not just a great restaurant its a total experience the food is delicious and represents the hunan province in china the restaurant is beautiful and staff kind whenever we have a visitor to shanghai lost heaven always makes the top 5 things we want to do with our friends while visiting the dishes are unique in every wayso try many different dishes, this is an upmarket asian restaurant with a longhistory of good food it was recommended by a number of frequent visitors to shanghai and we were not disappointed, this a great place to have an authentic chinese dinner with friends the service is amazing and the view from the bar on top is great, the restaurant has an authentic atmosphere that reminds me of lijiang in yunnan the food is also very delicious yunnan cuisine and delightfully presented booking is advised as the restaurant is always full, great food location means it is perfect for taking visitors after viewing the bund
the restaurant is too big slight cafeteria feel, ate here twice and wish we had gone here more dishes are not large so we were able to sample several each visit everything was excellent features food from the yunan area i only wish this place sold a cookbook so i could try at home cocktails were great service was also excellent dont miss this place, the food here is so good love the usage of plenty of herbs and greens quite different from the local oily chinese food the roast pork and dali chicken was so lip smackingly good very well balanced will be back for sure when i visit shanghai again, good food great ambience wonderful experience so lucky to get a table without reservations on a friday night 0 every dish tasted so different it was like opening presents on christmas day, lost heaven never disappoints me i am sure this is the best chinese food in town for a westerners palate the food decor and ambiance are always amazing and a really worthwhile experience

remember that you need to book in advance  this is a big restaurant but it is always packed

safter your meal take a short walk to the bund to see the night lights and the towers across the river if you have time catch the ferry to lujiazui very cheap and enjoy taxis can sometimes be a challenge after your meal, visited with three friends and we were all equally excited having enjoyed the best dinner in a long time ordered eight dishes to share all were excellent perfectly coocked and nicely displayed miao tribe hot and sour prawns and dai li style chicken with chili and green onions became two favorites attentive staff swift service, i always take my foreign visitors there
the food is authentic and some dishes are very spicy but overall quality is excellent
nice open terrace, the food here is very good but can be a little spicy the place is very dark we did not have a reservation but it would be a good idea to book beforehand as it was very busy bottles of wine expensive as they are in most restaurants in shanghai, this restaurant was open later than all the other restaurants we tried to visit at around 2130 friday night there were nice options to choose from and quite cheap, we have eaten here on previous trips to shanghai the food and service were as good as we remembered in the past the reason i took a star away was because they have misbilled my credit card when the bill came there is a check box to determine whether you want to pay in rmbchinese currency or us dollars even though i checked for rmb to be used they billed in us dollars costing me an extra 23 dollars in the process because of the higher rate used while its not a vast amount of money if the restaurant makes a practice of this as a profit enhancer then that borders on a lack of ethics, visited this restaurant twice last year worth your visit in terms of yunnan cuisine it was really fragrant unique and exotic for some dishes the ambience matches the unique taste, we have visited on three separate occasions at least 2years in between visitsand every time it is our best meal in shanghai we love the chicken with five spice and crispy pork, delicious yunan food for good price atmosphere inside is very nice must do reservation is advance, was here on my 1st day in shanghai overall foods were great but service was rather slow asked 3 times before they brought me my bill well they served the foods quite fast and generally their taste were great too, lots of good food choices meals have photos and english language descriptions pricing is reasonable and you can select your level of spice also we went on a wed evening and place was jammed we went at 6pm and they said reservations were full they asked if we agree to be finished by 745pm they would accommodate us we agreed and had a very nice experience, tried a lot of different restaurants in this trip but lost heaven was the one with most flavor and taste we did more of tapas styles where we ordered 8+ plates to share and it all turned out to be great spring roll was delicious, visited due to reviews from tripadvisor place was dark as mentioned but ambience was nice with good vibes  not a local restaurant more a up market barrestaurant kind of atmosphere service was good food was good though not in huge portions  favorites were the spicy prawns the cod fish and the fried pork ribs  worth a visit , superb place a little bit noisy because it is so popular but the food make up for that i would describe the cuisine as westernised chinese in that you dont have to spit bones and skin out when you are eating all the dishes we selected were excellent service was efficient prices a bit high but the quality was there lighting is a bit low so take care you dont fall up or down the steps in the restaurant, this one is on a different scale compared to the original one at gaoyou lu it really caters to the tourist and the groups with its multiplestorey huge dining rooms so you will hear an ambient noise during your dinner that you will forget once the food is on the table i recommend the dali chicken with scallion one of my favorite if youre in for a soup they make it on order so you have to wait for 40 minutes be patient as its one yunnan delicacy you have to try, always a safe bet when it comes to treat my guest from other countries dishes are simple and justified for western taste fully packed with expats and tourists love their stir fried chicken and beef what i suspect their most food are precooked and sometimes food quality gets down when they got really busy nevertheless in most occasions they do very good job, having had our fill of local dining we decided to splash out on a proper restaurant yes it has tablecloths and napkins

worth every yuan we paid 200 each plus drinks food good value drinks seemed a bit pricey cocktails the same as a glass of wine at 5065rmb

but the food was great starters inc lamb samosas which were the best weve had anywhere mains of chicken and beef were good and the special rice was really a meal on its own

its busy with groups we  a couple  had two parties of 20 and 30 next to us and it is a bit dark but the atmosphere is good yes its touristy but as a step up in quality at western prices it was worth it, made a late reservation here great staff food was excellent
service was very good huge dining space very lively crowdhighly recommend, although all the signs pointed to a very touristy place with bad food i was pleasantly surprised with some of the dishes service was very fast despite the huge crowd, we have visited this restaurant many times before whilst visiting the city for business and always had a good experience

we made a reservation for 1015 however we turned up at 1028 due to the fact that our plane landed late
we apologised and explained to the staff that we had been delayed and it was our only night in shanghai and hoped they could still seat us however they were extremely rude and said the kitchen was closed
i find that hard to believe as if we had arrived at the restaurant at 1015 the likely hood of us ordering our food by the time we arrived would be very slim
i found their attitude very rude and after they were not sympathetic or offer to call us a taxi
good restaurants normally make allowances for loyal customers and issues out of our control but not them
we will not visit here again, this is my second review of lost heaven on the bund the first one i wrote 4 years ago and i loved it now i visited lh twice in the last three months and was disappointed both the service and the quality of food went down significantly the ladies downstairs were rude in response to our inquiry regarding the booking the food is seriously overpriced and uninspiring we had vegetarian fried rice for 68rmb  there were a few bits of egg and cauliflower thats it the color and the taste were unappetizing we had much better fried rice on the street the veggies in tamarind sauce sounded good but didnt live to expectations the veggies were overcooked and too sour and whats with the lights you need to use your mobile to read the menu once upon a time it was a good restaurant now there are many places with better food for better price, this place had great reviews so we decided to give it a try we started in the bar and had some wonderful cocktails before we werent seated in the restaurant
we had a really delicious meal the won ton is amazing it was our last night in shanghai ands very memorable one, this is a great place for a business dinner or date � the upscale chinese ambiance makes this place enjoyable the third floor lounge is trendy and has a great outdoor area the massive second floor is more appropriate for a business dinner although the lighting can be a bit low lost heaven claims to feature food from the province of china but you can find some other regional foods or ingredients in use too flavors can be inconsistent inbetween visits but is still worth it reservations are highly recommended, we are not big fans of chinese food in general and shanghaiese food in particular imagine our surprise when we find a sensationally good chinese restaurant in shanghai

with its focus on yunnan and burmese it seems regional food we found it exceptionally interesting and extremely well prepared the attention to detail was what you expect in a good japanese restaurant and the food was just so flavourful varied and tasty

we shared six dishes between two adults and a 15 months old child and even the child couldntt get enough we had probably been fins with just five dishes but wanted to try as many as possible

the lost heaven concept would be successful in new york london or pretty much anywhere highly recommended, i frequent this establishment frequently and always have very attentive service great menu selection and the food is consistently well prepared delivered at the right temperature and spiced correctly i have brought many friends and colleagues both western and local and everyone always has great feedback and experiences from all the lighting cleanliness of lav facilities and place setting are all just really nice clean and well presented dont miss this if you are local and a definite must stop for travelers the other location in shanghai is equally great, after visiting this restaurant a couple of times its fair to say that its consistent the food is of a good quality and the menu is rather extensive with something to cater for a variety of tastes and dietary requirements although it is all yunnan cuisine seems like a cross between chinese and thai particular favourites include the signature cocktail it contains lemongrass and chillies roasted pork with superb crackling and the five spiced clams which are ridiculously addictive

the reason it doesnt get five stars is twofold one the lighting is far far too dark to the extent its practically impossible to read the menu without using a phone light and two its a big crowded place and it definitely feels like they try to cram in as many people as possible

overall a solid place to go for a midhigh price meal but perhaps not quite as fantastically amazing as previous reviews seem to suggest, i have been to this restaurant for lunch and dinner my recommendation is for dinner as the dark mysterious ambience makes the food even more enticing youll feel the texture more and the explosion of flavours in your mouth makes the food even more delicious the drawback is that it is indeed dark the candles are insufficient lighting so be prepared for some stumbling if youre finding your place around the restaurant, we followed the many positive comments and were not disappointed at all the food was tasty and of very high quality though some here say that waiters lacked english skills this did not match our experience a great first experience in shanghai, as usual the restaurant is proving very good quality food and service
i recommend it without any hesitation as one of the best restaurant in shanghai
and also one of the nicest, the place was worht visiting we were very happy with the site the service but we struggle with the waiters to communicate since almost no one spoke english
food was great and cocktails too, came here for what turned out to be one of the best meals we had in china great service great interiour decoration and whats most important some excellent yunan cooking

highly recommended, my partner had been the night before and bought me for lunch the next day the cocktails are beautiful and a bit different we went for lunch and had the lamb somosas the pork and some prawns  all three dishes were beautiful lots and lots of options on the menu a really busy place but service is fast and your table feels private","Indian cuisine",0.999754538791626
140,"a group of cohorts and i had a about an hour and stopped briefly for a lunch and the food was good and prices relatively reasonable the group ordered salads soup sandwich and vegetables with noodles

the seasoning of the vegetables and noodles were good and the group commented the taste of their respective dishes were good

overall this was a good stop but if given the chance for a longer sitdown would prefer to choose another location, wide range of food available especially for breakfast however the chef preparing omelette needs better training because he does not heed instructions from clients for example i asked for an omelette which i will collect within 5 mins due to my urgent need when i returned to collect the omelette within the 5 mins he said that he would prepare another one because he had given mine to another customer, 9pm yes i know a bit late but still seafood looked old not fresh hot dishes were merely warm enough said, i have been to many hotel breakfast spread but i must say this place is huge nicely segregated as well with asian and international selection not to mention the extremely courteous staff kudos to their trainingservice, if your target is a quick lunch with a reasonable quality that is ok the place offers pasta noodles rice and a sort of grilled steak on top of that you also find sea food and some fresh cut of yellow fish tuna or salmon sashimi not remarkable but food taste really good
service is just fine, with international buffet and also indian pavilion it was amazing food experience with selection of food from thai italian japanese chinese and desert was out of this world, big big big buffet did i mention its big not bad overall its a decent hotel buffet with an enormous range of choices eastern and western like any place that offers 28odd pages worth of menu options this is a do many things but none outstandingly kind of place however given the staggering number of choices the overall quality is certainly more than acceptable, nice hotel with good foods and the assistant manager in the shanghai city bistro his name is danny is super nice and treat us really good and attended to all our needs the music in the restaurant is also good since its of the western type of music its a nice place to come if you want to enjoy and danny is the best manager i have ever seen, stayed for 2 nights and ate at the restaurant for breakfast included choices of food is excellent with both traditional shanghai cuisine and western menus comparable to many of the top asian hotels spacious also to ensure there are lots of seats a relaxing place to get started for the day, first of all staff is very friendly and attentive they speak englishfoodbig variety and beautiful layout of food here with different sections fresh seafoodsashimi and sushiwestern and chinesefresh noodles yummy ice cream especially matcha tea flavoura must try","Turkish cuisine",0.999707601543394
141,"you have to come to this shaoxing restaurant with a local because its in an obscure area of town the menu is in chinese and the staff dont speak english you also have to be openminded and adventurous as unlike other chinese regional cuisines shaoxing is more rural in flavour specialities include fried stinking tofu drunken chicken the version here is extremely alcoholic yellow fish soup shaoxing yellow rice wine the older the wine the darkerbrowner it becomes but in season best is the shanghai hairy crab  delicious highquality crabs females have lots of roe selling at a fraction of the price in hk or singapore no wonder its packed essentially with locals, shaoxing style fare is hard to find outside shoaxing because its pretty weird stuff but its worth trying and is a unique jiangnan experience huangjiu yellow paired with drinking food is the standard you can get all the favorites here including pork belly and pickled mustard greens but the best thing on the menu here are the moss fish sticks <u+82d4><u+6761><u+5c0f><u+9ec4><u+9c7c> delicious, i appreciated large menu from where to choose a great coose of food i loved this kind of small pieces of octopus marinated in a spicy sauce, i had a dinner which organized by the mate who had been to shanghai several year as one of the highly ranked chinese restaurant we expected a lot more than we got from the restaurant food was very salty and soy sauce taste except the chinese rice wine i did not have an opportunity to order other drink wait staff is the most impolite person dropped the food without check if ur
, obviously the restaurant doesnt offer a decent menu for the westerners very chinese food so i dont know why its highly rated on ta which mostly the readers are international service is just a big mess did not pay enough attention is it the expectation you looking for, this place serves up very good shaoxing food they offer small plates of traditional dishes to go with the wine love their marinaded tofu pieces the house shaoxing wine is fantastic the restaurant is always packed so it is recommended to reserve ahead the service is actually not bad by chinese standard the waitresses smile sometimes and are helpful","steakhouse",0.606680374720783
142,"this restaurant is part of a chain and is in a mall location but the food was out of this world the dumplings were the best we had throughout our trip to china we had lunch there and was very happy with the service especially because it was so busy, this is a great restaurant that i when to before but the outlet are no more in operation i travel a long way to get disappointed as the outlet are no more in operation, went there alone having read of all of these rave reviews and the only thing i can really remember about the meal was my reaction on getting the bill  one of awe that any restaurant could sell me chinese takeaway quality food at michelin star prices i ordered tofu with crab hair and received some lukewarm slop for the equivalent of 25 euros i am still stunned by that

the dumplings were great they explode in your mouth etc but i will just be eating street food for the remainder of my stay here i learned my lesson going in that place, my friend took me there for some xiolongbao and dim sum even though theres a chain in my city bkk i wanted to try it everything she ordered was great and delicious the service was good and fast but we were there after lunch hours theres a kitchen with big window that you can watch those dim sum being made, we were there for dinner and it was almost empty food quality was mixed xiao long bao were excellent and won ton soup was tasteless way overpriced you find better places for much less, the xiaolongbao were as always beyond perfection and all the dishes were really tasty we were disappointed that some dishes were not available as the hot and sour soup is usually good the black sesame balls in sweet soup are probably the most delicious dessert anywhere service was very good though some dishes were slow this food is perfect for expats or those unused to real chinese food, should try the truffle dumplings but my partner doesnt want to and we almost lost it and eat somewhere else if we havent ask someone they should indicated that dindaifung alrdy moved upstairs in chinaproblems are no certain direction for everything, loved it all as promised we had wandered shanghai for 3 days and really enjoyed the dumplings offered here just across from the yue gardens entrance, we were on a daytour of shanghai and our guide led us to the restaurant for lunch and made some personal recommendations for which items were particularly good she was so right this place is delicious and in particular we loved the soup dumplings spicy wontons vegetable dumplings and the rituals of dipping these in the delicious soy and vinegar mix i could have stayed here all afternoon trying their range of tasty morsels, we visited beijing shanghai hong kong and macao in july 2015 and the ding tai fung near the yuyuan garden was where we had our best meal during that trip we tried all kinds of dumplings and it was absolutely delicious they arent the cheapest dumplings you can find in shanghai but they are still pretty affordable if you compare with a restaurant in north america i had a hard time resisting to the temptation to go to the hong kong ding tai fung franchise thats how much i liked my experience at the yuyuan garden one , i absolutely loved this restaurant the soup dumplings are to die for imo they were so good i went back again the following day during a recent trip to japan i made a point of visiting a couple of din tai fung restaurants throughout both tokyo and kyoto
my only caution would be a eat carefully as the soup inside is quite hot other than that eat away dont blame me if you find yourself addicted as well, i have eaten at many din tai fung locations across asia and this one in yuyuan garden is convenient and has excellent food as a vegetarian i find they have good choices for dumplings and vegetable side dishes service is quick and its an easy place to grab a good meal they are on the second floor of a larger building in the yu gardens area look for yu fashion garden there is a small open courtyard area in the front of the building highly recommend, ive eaten at this restaurant at least 20 times since ive have been in shanghai it never disappoints if youre in shanghai then its a must service is also very good, we have eaten at their restaurant in sydney and hong kong and always enjoy the meal this was no exception we had a selection of dumpling including their soup dumplings xiao long bao excellent meal recommend if you like a dumpling, the restaurant is just outside an exit 8 i think from yuyuan garden complex and across the street its set back from the road  we missed it initially looking only at the old side of the street its on the new side its upstairs and has its name across the front

we arrived a bit before noon on a weekday for lunch they werent crowded although it was certainly filling up by the time we left we had more soup dumplings than we should have they were really tasty and a nice fruit plate for dessert

service is attentive without being pushy, showing my friends from oversea we recently visited yu garden and had tried shanghai dim sum in this restaurant although its a bit noisy the shao long bao was delicious and the hosts are friendly and attentive we ordered different kinds and every kind has the character
nice lunch, on a cold rainy day while showing yuyang gardens to some friends from california we decided to find someplace warm for lunch the dumplings were excellent definitely try the siew long bao with hairy crab we had seconds the portion sizes were good small dumplings absolutely fresh no roving carts but they delivered your order as the dishes were ready

the place is comfortable upscale and was a perfect choice for the first meal in china, xiao long bao the pork and soupfilled dumplings is famous in shanghai it is a must try delicacy in shanghai this restaurant is good quality nice and delicious dumplings and clean environment mpling the staff were friendly menu is in chinese and english with price tag clearly listed many small delicious dishes recommended january 2015, we ate here with a group and our tour leader ordered for us the chains specialty soup dumplings were delicious and everything else was also of very good quality din tai fung has a lot of locations in shanghai as well as some in other major chinese cities we were looking forward to this and were not disappointed, it was a pretty nice lunch  not as great as the michelin star place in hong kong but good place to go for a nice lunch and right in the heart of old shanghai, we recently ate at this din tai fung location the service was average rushed and a little underwhelming the restaurant was a little dreary inside compared to the one on nanjing road and the prices were the same at 7 pm they were sold out of truffle xiaolongbao their signature dumpling never got to try it thus the visit to the other location the other dishes we had were all good but this particular location just doesnt have the service that the nanjing location has so choose wisely, chose this particular ding tai fung as it was within walking distance from our hotel as with the other outlets this one also excels with its dumplings and wonton soups and excellent service it was clean and comfortable and is located in tourist shopping area not too far from the bund perfect for an after dinner stroll, as many below have said this branch of dtf isnt the one to raise the flag check out the ones higher in tge shanghai trip advisor list and definitely dont judge until you visit one of the michelin star venues eg taiwan or hk

dumplings here are as per the standard good quality recipe venue not so nice just passable value for money well its the same price in shanghai vs hong kong which has a michelin star so to me given the country and currency conversion they should make it cheaper than its sister stores 60 yuan for 10x small xiao long bao is pretty steep given alternative options around

bottom line try it if youre nearby but make sure to try others and be adventurous with local ones like yangs or if your iron stomach can handle try some bustling popular side street dumplings, big space in a touristy area of shanghai went there for lunch i was there by myself but they managed to make my experience very warm and welcoming
i tried 3 different steamed dumplings and the fried rice with pork cutlet
food flavors were on point very clean and delicious and i think it was very affordable
excellent experience and would definitely go back any given time
the only thing is that i would come with friends the next time in order to be able to order a variety of their menu offerings, the food is what you expect from ding tai fung what was slightly disappointing for us is the shabbiness of the place almost every chair at our table had a split seat cushion, i tried 5 different places that day and ding tai fung was around 3 great dumplings great soup a little more gingery compared to the nanxiang ones nearby

but its much more expensive and i would skip it if i were on a budge, well i love the ding tai feng in every city though i dont typically like their xiao long bao but the cong you ban mian is the best and i can have two, our lunch at this restaurant was certainly one of the best weve eaten in china and was recommended by our local guide who also arranged the selection of foods for us it seems that din tai fung has about fourteen outlets across a number of chinese cities and at least one in sydney that im assured has a similar menu of the same high standard one of the highlights of the yu gardens outlet apart from the amazing soup and dumplings is the viewing room where you can watch a number of highly skilled staff rolling out the dumpling dough and fashioning it into the dumplings that will soon be served in the adjacent restaurant, we were a group of seven that arrived had a fast service from waiters that of course spoke no english but were very kind and helpful nonetheless very good food and a good location on the brink of yu yuan garden definitely worth visiting despite being located a bit oddly and off on a third floor on a derelict shopping center above the costa coffee but once youre there  its good, i had a very tasty lunch of xiaolongbao after visiting yu garden the soup dumplings were very tasty and dishes i saw at other tables also looked appetising very friendly and helpful service i was on my own and they brought me an englisch newspaper too keep me busy untill the food was served also my teapot was refilled at no extra charge and without me having too ask for it small things like that make a difference for me, very good the best dumplings i ever had if you go shopping or sightseing at the yu garden area choose this place to eat, honestly local snacks in yuyuan garden dont look quite clean and a bit overpriced i would recommend a quick bite here in ding tai fung, i did like the dumplings here but i feel they were perhaps overhyped i feel far cheaper tastier dumplings can be found around shanghai but i suppose it is all a matter of taste i prefer dumplings with vegetables and less juice i would not have queued very long for this place and the service was not brilliant as it took us quite a while to get a soup dumpling, we had an excellent lunch  the dumplings were incredible  especially the steamed pork and the shrimpporksitcky rice but the hot and sour soup sticky pork buns green beans and fried rice were all delicious as well

our server was incredibly friendly and professional and we found the whole experience easy seamless and fun so glad we went, we went here a few days after eating at ding tai fung in xiantandi and found it presented the same outstanding quality of food and exceptional service, visited here for a last meal in china before flying home

the two foot long hair in the broccoli should have been enough to send us on our way but with a checkout and long cab ride to the airport ahead we persisted after waiting for over 30 minutes for our dumplings to come we finally received them

we were underwhelmed with the taste and cost but the true shock came 6 hours later as our plane levelled out somewhere over the east china sea

what came next was 12 hours of absolute horror as our bodies tried to purge all remnants of those fateful mushroom dumplings out of whatever orifice they could

so please trip advisor allow zero stars or better yet negative stars as this is the only meal that cost me not only 397 rmb but 6 kg of my and my wifes body mass and made an entire boeing 777 a very unpleasant place to be even typing the word mushroom still makes me want to be ill, love the service the food and the environment my husband is a loyal fan to this place they have own kit for the kids which we highly appreciate not the cheapest but definitely amongst the most popular and best for tourists, this is one of those restaurants you feel you sorta gotta go to because its famous and when are you going to be at yuyuan garden in shanghai again also the food really is very good when you first come into the yuyuan garden area especially at night youre hit by the wow factor because of all the dazzling lights and the crowds once you find your way to the restaurant you notice the line outside is very long and you can be easily discouraged however those people are waiting to eat outside or take home we chose to go inside upstairs where we would pay a bit more but be able to sit and relax the service was just fair and not particularly friendly which is a shame because the dumplings are wonderful and a nicer atmosphere would have made the visit memorable, we had eaten at the ding tai fung in the french concession and loved it and left a five star glowing review

so when we were in the area and it was getting a bit late we decided a good bet would be to do another ding tai fung experience when we arrived the host said the kitchen would be closing in 20 minutes but there were at least 20 diners still there

we ordered promptly and all was fine until the young waiter arrived and put the bill down on the table and asked us to pay it when i pointed out that i was in the middle of my meal he insisted that i settle the bill immediately talk about spoiling the ambience

subsequently the staff were hustling and bustling in clean up mode  despite there being other diners there all pretence at service and professionalism had disappeared  they just wanted to get home

sorry to leave an average rating but if this was our first experience of ding tai fung we would never have gone back, okay i will start with the admission that the food was indeed very good if price is no object then i definitely recommend this restaurant unfortunately if price is a variable for you then there are cheaper dumplings and dim sum that are also delicious and can be found for far less money elsewhere in the amazing city of shanghai this was our second most expensive meal since moving here and we only went for lunch

overall terrific food but with prices like these its probably more for the tourists than the locals, xiao long pau the pork and soupfilled dumplings is famous in shanghai it must accompaniment with dark zhejiang vinegar it is a must try delicacy in shanghai

you can find xiao long paubao everyway in shanghai but if you want a good quality nice delicious dumplings and clean environment din tai fung is highly recommended the closest branch available is near yuyuan garden one of the tourist spot

besides xiao long pau one can also try out theyre significant beef noodle with tasty broth a basket contains 10pieces of xiao long pau

this place is children friendly kids were giving the dumplings dough to play with the dough is actually the real dough for the dumpling the staff were friendly and you were treated like vip menu is in chinese and english with price tag clearly listed, i went to other branches before and i know the food was good so i brought a group here in my last visit to shanghai last time i was alone and i wasnt so satisfied for alone you can only order one or two dishes this time with a group of 6 we ordered loads of different dim sum i think the classic ones are the best pork and shrimp xiaoloubao and the groups favorite was the mushroom filling we all said we are not that hungry and want to eat something small but ended up eating too much difficult to say no to good food, usually we dine at the super brand mall or xintiandi outlets but since we were in yuyuan decided to check it out was pretty dark upon entry service was efficient as usual we order the chicken and pork xiao long pau plus some veges and other starters one dish did not arrive we later found out they did not include it

the meat in the xiao long was lumpy a first for us in any dtf not just in one or two but most of the 10 dumplings per tray both hubby and i had the same experience then we ordered a fruits with sago dessert and the coconut milk was very diluted so the taste was barely there

we were handed a comments card upon paying so we wrote down our comments the staff spent some moment asking us for clarification which we did extensively i hope the chef got the message too, perhaps it was what we ordered but strangely for a chain of restaurants we felt this was not as good as the one we visited a few days previously in the super brand mall
not overly cheap  we paid 293 rmb including a 10 service charge, i was on a walking tour in shanghai with a chinese friend who lives in beijing but raised near shanghai when he saw the sign for din tai fung he became visibly excited and explained that we had to have dim sum there the restaurant is on the 2nd floor and the entrance somewhat hidden very clean restaurant super friendly staff there were several parties of europeans and americans children are welcome we chose the set menu of 6 courses for 135 yuan excellent tasty delightful mix of mouth sensations best meal i had in three days in shanghai my chinese friend was very pleased definitely recommend, all around great choice if you are looking for great food great service in a restaurant not catering to tourists the dumplings were wonderful and the waitstaff were incredibly friendly and helpful they showed us how to eat dumplings like real professionals the best restaurant we found so far in shanghai the restaurant is modern but warm and comfortable after dinner you can browse through all the little shops in the area a nice evening, ive been going to this restaurant for several years and every time it is just delicious the dim sum is the best made fresh in front of you and the soup filled varieties are to die for then there are the entrees again always fresh and delicious, it is located in the old town just behind yuyuan garden at the 2nd floor of a building in a spacious square the menu is rich of choices not only dim sum the ambiance is modern and trendy the waiters speak english and are kind and very helpful dim sum are excellent as well as their noodles selection prices are correct considering food and service quality of this restaurant, i think one of the best dumpling restaurants there is do not forget to take the soup dumplings and be surprised by the magnificent taste, we chose this restaurant based solely on trip adviser comments having had some less successful chinese food experiences
the dumplings were superb the service was friendly and efficient and the
riding was reasonable
we would highly recommend this for dumplings we didnt try anything else","dumpling restaurant",0.966086691687087
143,"this place is the perfect balance between good price quality food nonpretentious atmosphere but also clean and inviting delicious food i feel like you cant go wrong with any dish i like that they do not use msg in their recipes the space is small we shared a table with 4 other groups we ate the fried duck shanghai style the dates and rice fish with green onions shanghai noodles and spring rolls i would return to this place, this is apparently shanghaiese food made without the msg and thank god for that lots of fish dishes which were all yummy if maybe a little funny trying to figure out how to eat do you peel those tiny shrimp but beware the definition of shanghaiese food is oil oil oil good place for vegetarians and pescatarians too affordable local style food but as a nonlocal you wont turn heads when you walk in menu in chinese and english look for the huge street to roof glass window panes and youve found it , one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai unassuming but subtly stylish jianguo 328 aptly named being that it is located at 328 jianguo road is a wonderful little gem serving delectable shanghainese morsels of food the place is tiny  two floors but can seat maybe 25 people ok has one large as in seats more than 4 people tables upstairs but the tiny kitchen is a force to be reckoned with the crowd pleaser is the eight treasures duck  a whole duck yes stuffed with eight treasures cooked in a lotus leaf forever melting at the mouth but other less well known dishes are also well worth exploring  if you have never had stinky tofu no seriously do me a favor and give it a try on account of this review no its not a dare although it is an acquired taste that pushes the upper limits of umami try it at jianguo 328 and you will not be sorry, one of the best meals we had in china we queued for a very long time before being taken to our shared table the two of us and two people on a date and a bunch of guys we over ordered but it was great value particular highlights were a sweet pork belly dish and a great aubergine dish a friend of ours who lives in beijing said to always order aubergine dishes in china and its a tip im happy to pass on they brought our bill to us once wed eaten which i have no problem with as there was still a big queue outside, as someone who was born and raised in shanghai let me tell you that there are better places out there to eat authentic shanghainese food no need to waste your money and time here the taste was sub par not how the food are supposed to taste their house special lemon iced tea was probably made from powdered tea mix not real leaf tea taste the service was also off  made a reservation online but was told that our reservation was cancelled when we get there, i didnt know shanghainese food could be so excellent 328 is opened by a taiwanese but it serves shanghainese local home cook food

every dish served was excellent i enjoyed the fried yellow croaker served with spring onions the braised pork was meltinyourmouth i didnt realise that liver could taste so good

highly recommended do make a reservation  the place is small and it is very popular so you may not be able to get a seat if you dont plan ahead, great spot that is really local better go after 8pm once the local crowd is done eating descent prices and fast served i will come back again, wanted to surprise a very important customer with an alternative dining venue away from the usual 5 star touristy places and also the bigger shanghainese restaurants which are aplenty in shanghai i came across this place in trip advisor and decided to explore a bit

its a very small unremarkable shop house in the french concession and very chinese charming and cosy very busy and at 630 pm they had stopped taking reservations so i tried anyway and was delighted by their food quality the two of us shared a round table with 2 other groups of couples and it was oddly very fun

very authentic home cooking and was told no or little msg anyway the photos speak for themselves, great homecook food very popular with the expat community  expect a long wait their braised pork shanghaistyle is worth a try can be difficult to reach if you are not familiar with shanghai  but a great area to explore nevertheless, we went there a bit late ordered fww shanghai dishes all are good staff was very helpful recommending some dishes
definitely a good little shanghai gem, this place is not too big and the food is really good and safe highly recommand for people who dont want to surprised, had dinner here with the wife and we enjoyed some of the dishes the deep fried croaker on a basket of spring onions and the deep fried duck legs were very good the latter reminded me of the french duck confit thought with five spice

the hongshao rou was unusual as it had quail eggs rather than that usual large egg but i thought it lacked the caramel flavour and was bland we also ordered a plate of spinach with garlic  it was fresh and nice

we enjoyed the tea  one was an iced tea while the other was a tea made of dates both were refreshing

service was attentive and quick they only have around 10 small tables below and 8 on the upper level so reservations are recommended, first time to shanghai and pick the restaurant name off a nytimes 36 hours article started getting concerned in the taxi ride as the neighborhood didnt look like it would have a destination restaurant but this small restaurant is a gem that serves a variety of local cuisine with an eye to local sourcing and seasonal dishes the dining area is small so make reservations they had two seatings 6 and 8 pm our difficulty was that everything that passed our table coming out of the kitchen looked amazing the chicken legs were delicious mushrooms were savory shanghai noodles are a standard and the price for 3 was y 250 or about $40 wait staff is helpful and very professional, the perfect place for dinner or lunch in the french concession we went back several times on our visit delicious, loved the duck legs might have been the best broccoli dish ive ever had noodles and mushroom were good house red wine was passable huge meal for 128 rmb way too much food for one but it was so worth it, very good shanghai cuisine for the price we paid rmb450 for 4 person not including drinks reservation is encouraged as the restaurant is not very big and definitely more customers will definitely be back again, ive visited this place twice for lunch in the last two weeks it has a great menu for shanghainese food a warm and welcoming staff and much cleaner than many other similar venues that try to package a good food experience this place is a cut above the rest thanks guys cant wait to get back here again for lunch or dinner i particularly enjoy the small environment and the food the food is just fantastic, great food delicious very authentic local taste portion is just make for one or couple friends to share

better make reservation before you go or you may wait for tables since the place is small, ill start by admitting that shanghainese food outside of xiao long bao and sheng jian bao is not my favorite chinese food yet i left largely impressed with jian guo 328 which we selected instead of old jesse

the fried duck leg was my very favorite dish it was crispy minimally greasy and served with some charred onions and scallions i just could not stop gnawing on this perfectly seasoned and moist duck with its brittle crisp skin aside from peking duck one of the very best duck dishes ive ever had from there the food was a little less successful

the ubiquitous red braised pork was tasty and relatively tender but this sweet sticky dish is just not my ideal order also we had enjoyed a much better version at the sensational fu 1015 the night before still fans of the dish should enjoy this version

yellow croakers were cooked well and tasty enough but to me the accompanying charred scallions were the best part of the dish thanks in part to the imported flavor from the fish

noodles with scallion oil were tasty as was a braised mushroom again despite its expected sweetness stinky tofu was also good but big fans of the dish may find this version to be lacking a bit in funk we also had some greens which were decently cooked but perhaps a tad overdone

overall a good meal the restaurant was packed though we had our hotel make a reservation for us the restaurant apparently prides itself in not permitting smoking and using less oil both aspects were noticeable and made for a nice dining environment and service was both prompt and friendly

i cant recall if they had an english menu but note that throughout china the waygo app came in extraordinarily handy for us it works on your phone even when not using wifi or wireless and is fantastic at translating menus we speak virtually no chinese but had no problem reading chinese language menus throughout china using the app and were even asked to write down the name of the app a couple of times by restaurants download it before you go its only about $7 for a lifetime of unlimited translations, this great restaurant is located at not far from my shanghai office i came here for lunch special two or three times a week i also had early dinners at 530 pm every now and then in addition to the stuffed duck limited two per day there are few other special dishes are highly recommended but need to reserve a day or two before one of my favorites is braised pick hock just had one the night before yummy as always the meat is so juicy soft and flavorful most of fat oil is gone and the skin taste so so great cannot wait to go back to have it again, jianguo 328 has the allure of a neighbourhood restaurant  small warm lively unpretentious arriving without a reservation on a rainy wednesday evening i was still welcomed in the place was packed except for a small table just vacated which i was promptly directed to the braised pork with chestnuts and quail eggs was delicious tender and was brought to the table fairly quickly
staff were warm and efficient all around me patrons seemed to be house regulars enjoying their evening
it boasts using no funky oils or msg and using only filtered water anyone whos been in china for more than a few weeks will appreciate the initiative
definitely reccommended, first off my first taste of shanghai cuisine i was not disappointed the place is a small restored shophouse in shanghai the ceiling rather low and has this certain charm in it

it was packed when i arrived and sharing tables is the norm just like my experience in hong kong the food is excellent and i would say the main star is the <u+7d05><u+71d2><u+8089> hongshao rou loaded with prime fatty pork meat quail eggs and chestnuts in a sweet dark sauce wonderful experience the fried duck drumsticks are good but rather dry the other great dish is the scallion noodles really fragrant, with my office around the corner i have passed jianguo 328 nearly everyday but only recently did i actually try it out and after all the hype based on reviews and magazine writeups i had high expectations fun lively atmosphere in the little restaurant with decent service but cant name any dishes that stood out and some were just a letdown

had a bottle of warmed yellowwine to match the shanghainese flavors loving soybraised pork the fatty bit and all i was completely let down by the empty flavor of theirs which obviously wasnt cooked very long and lacking in both flavor could only describe it as brown  if that could even be considered a flavor and texture the duck leg dusted in salt was dried out and thankfully there was salt or there would have been no flavor the other three i was with two foreign one domestic werent impressed and all agreed it was the same or less than a meal youd find at any average restaurant though without the steeper prices from the fish to the beans to the tofu and whatever other dishes we had i just cant understand what the hype is about maybe in off night as the place was packed saw the chinese sixoclock rush finish and the international rush begin about 8 but no plans on returning

had read that they stop serving at 930pm and as we were still quite hungry after the eight dishes that we ordered at 9pm we requested the menu and they said the kitchen was now closed  even though the restaurant was packed and there was no mention of the kitchen closing early went elsewhere after for more food, if you are looking for delicious chinese food in a sweet casual place that clearly knows what it is doing then you should not miss this place first off a reservation is needed that already is a great sign the interior is simple but feels good clean and white and wood staff is friendly smiling and helpful even the non english speakers there are also english speakers availble the place was busy but the service is still quick the menu has a large range as many chinese restuarants do so it is quite easy to find dishes that you want to try the dishes we ordered were delicious arrived to the table piping hot the serving sizes were great so even though we ordered 67 dishes for two of us there was minimal food waste we also ate a lot leaving full and extremely satisfied i would definitely recommend it, its small book ahead its delicious genuine local food its healthy no msg no smoking they only use purified water for cooking and renew their oil frequently its friendly the staff are so nice what more do you want portions are perfect for single people couples and groups they have bigger tables upstairs and even a new room people like david cameron have checked this place out if it is full just order takeaway i live next to this place, if youre looking for a fancy dinner with a group of friends dont come here it is very small in size so finding a seat might be difficult reservations are highly recommended at peak times there are only a handful of tables downstairs and two large tables upstairs so it is quite cramped but the ambiance makes up for it

the wait staff are extremely friendly and talkative and they always recommend the most delicious dishes this is one of the few places in china where the servers genuinely cared about my meal the experience i was having and my review of the food

the food itself is absolutely delicious the hong shao rou is a definite must they make a unique recipe with chestnuts in the sauce which gives it a sweet and savory flavor divine the toufu skin <u+8c46><u+8150><u+5e72> in the cold dishes also makes a great starter and gives diversity to all of the sweet and heavy shanghainese food

and oh the ban mian is to die for its amazing at lunch time you can choose peanut sauce and sesame ban mian but in the evening they only have the standard shrimp flavor the ban mian is delicious and its definitely up there on my death row meal

alcohol here is also affordable a bottle of wine will only run you 7090 kuai and the quality is superb white wine with hong shao roummm absolutely delicious many good memories were here and i will definitely return next time im in shanghai, we arrived at this place for dinner without a reservation but were quickly found a seat downstairs which gave us a view of the whole room the restaurant was busy and as the evening progressed new customers were directed upstairs the food was shanghai style and was very good service was efficient and polite other customers appeared to be mainly local folk who seemed to be enjoying their meal as much as we were lots of tsingtao beer was being quaffed so we had a few bottles it was cold and refreshing going well with the food the bill was very reasonable we intend to visit here again, this was our second visit there first time we went in a group of 7 we were seated upstairs  that is the only place you want to seat there as downstairs has no ambience at all second time we went in a group of 4 and had reservations for upstairs they have there one smaller table for 5 pm at 605 pm when not all of our dishes yet arrived another family arrived that  guess what  had a reservation for the very same table for 630 pm they were seated waiting right next to our table and the teenage girl played loudly some noisy games next to our table completely spoiling our dinner unfortunately a lot of locals do not understand how to behave or how to rein their kids as she did not stop her games despite repeated requests in chinese needless to say when we did not yet finish restaurants signature duck dish and did not drink the second bottle of wine we were basically told to leave we had never had that happened in all the years as much as we were impressed with the first visit we were totally let down by the second consider yourself prewarned we will take our dinning rmbs somewhere else, attracted by the top reviews for this restaurant i had dinner there last night you step a few steps down from street level one floor up there are two large round tables as well and find yourself in quite a small place with whitewashed walls and only a few old mirrors for decoration it is quite full however so you certainly need a reservation the guests are almost all chinese which speaks for the quality of the food

there is no smoking here the owner says he uses organic ingredients and indeed you have the impression that you get healthy and simple shanghai food without any highclass ambitions contrary to what i read before the prices are very reasonable i paid 240 yuan for a dinner for two including soup lamb and vegetable with a bottle of wine i cannot complain about the service which was very busy however so you had to do something to get their attention

all in all i will certainly come back when i want a simple healthy and inexpensive meal from a shanghai style kitchen i fail to see however how on this basis the restaurant got top marks among shanghai restauran, apart from its apparent popularity among the tourists and expats there is nothing particularly outstanding about this restaurant its food ambiance or location everything is very mediocre with the service being nonexistent what gets served is your typical home style cooking that you can get pretty much everywhere in shanghai definitely not worth the hype or travel and there are plenty of other fine choices out there cash only no cards definitely not coming back, this is the kind of restaurant one expects in major cities good healthy food at good prices with good service in ny this would be a 2nd tier rest in shanghai  it is first tier the day we went we were the only nonchinese in the place  a good sign a great way to taste the local food at its best, living since many years partly in shanghai as an expat i never even heard of it but due to the ranking we gave it a try the party of 4 was very surprised by the quality of the food and the cooking even the red de bortoli australian matched well try the liver stinky tofu fried noodles kidney and many more even the price will not disappoint you full belly for about 110<u+00a5> pp dont expect a luxurious environment its small humble informal uncomfortable seating and noisy but the food is top, as a near 5 year resident of shanghai i dont hop on trip advisor too often to look at shanghai itself but on happenstance i was amazed to see this restaurant ranked so highly i live one block away and the idea of people coming all the way out here from their bund hotels is quite amusing

heres what the summary of jiango 328 is through my canadian mind

1 this is shanghainese food realized by taiwanese owners you can be sure the line cooks are locals din tai fung is also a realization of mostly shanghainese dishes by taiwanese owners
2 this restaurant claims to use mostly  all organic ingredients though this isnt possible given the costs of things like organic soy sauce and vinegar in china
3 you can in fact get better options for alcohol than in a typical chinese restaurant where chinese rice wine poor chinese redwhite wine and tsingtao beer reign
4 prices are higher than in a local restaurant but as mentioned this may be due to organic ingredients
5 english menu is available and you can point your way through your ordering process if you dont speak chinese
6 staff are relatively shy and friendly

what i feel

1 food is fairly good and authentic but value for money is a valid question
2 you can in fact try stinky tofu here that isnt so stinky and has a relatively authentic taste probably the best in shanghai that i personally have had
3 shanghainese food will be unusual for many used to western takes on chinese expect no dishes with the word general or moo shu in front of them and is generally sweet be prepared for that
4 if you end up here youre not going to get sick as food safety is quite good you should feel fine eating cold dishes even if youve got a light stomach

all of that said this is not worthy of the top 50 restaurants in shanghai somebody positioned themselves well, i was introduced to this small but cosy eating outlet by a foodie friend it was an excellent dinner the service was prompt and efficient while the place was small the restaurant managed to keep the food and drinks flowing and everyone was served in good time

we ordered the signature dishes like the stuffed duck giantsize mushroom and braised pork it was authentic and a breadth of fresh air compared to the larger establishments

the location was interesting please note all units of even number are on one side of the street and the odd number units are on the other side highly recommended and i will come again on my next trip to shanghai, the restaurant is small and looks average however dont judge by her appearance the dishes there are authentic and down to earth especially love the stinky tofu as the tofu is brilliantly wrapped by a sheet of beancurd so the bad smell is gone but the favor is still kept inside the lovely little package the 10year old chinese wine is also good  easy to drink with a unique fragrance
portion is small but this is perfect as we can order a great variety, i live near by and found this restaurant on top of the list so had to try civilised portion not so big which i prefer as i hate to leave food ordered duck confit chinese version braised pork  and some vegs all were good its home style chinese restaurant and not trying to be anything else for that its good id go back for casual dinner as i live near its not somewhere youd go specially though  im surprised its so high up on the ranking, small friendly inexpensive and well worth the waitwe had tried a few times to go but the national holidays caught usso ring in advancethey do have a tight schedule so better to go early as there are only limited seats and its closed by 9 or 10 at the very latest
we got help from our dining neighbors and ordered some great noodles whole yellow fish and grandmas pork and spring rolls and this was a perfect amount for 2, i was excited to pay a visit after reading previous reviews here on ta i was not let down however it is still only a small local restaurant with traditional shanghai food so dont expect something different
a highlight among the dishes we had tonight was the deep fried ribs with spices which was very tasty and incredible value for money
we will definitely come back and try more dishes the restaurant is still a little gem, we made reservations at 328 based on the ta reviews our hotel les suites orient made the reservation for us and the manager said it was one of his favorite traditional restaurants cab ride was about 15 minutes from the bund and easy to find

the restaurant seats about 20 people and is very quaint the wine they served was excellent and a nice change from the chinese beers most of the wines in china are from chile or argentina we ordered the braised pork to start which was a huge disappointment by braised they meant raw and it was inedible the noodles chicken and broccoli were quite good but not as good as some of the other local restaurants we ate in

the neighborhood is very nice as it is near tian zi fang and the french concession i would recommend combining with a visit to these neighborhoods as food is not good enough for a special cross town trip, absolutely delicious and such good value recommend the braised pork yellow fish spring rolls and rice pancakes with pork we went midweek and was quite busy they finish serving around 930pm or just before so suggest going a little earlier or booking ahead fantastic, we went at 530 on a sunday evening and it was already filling up for the evening the menu is full of lovely shanghainese dishes and the staff are exceedingly helpful and willing to offer recommendations tell you if you need moreless food etc really loved everything we ordered it was also really great value we went with our 12 month old son and they didnt have highchairs but that wasnt really a problem as we always carry a travel chair for him there was lots of food on the menu that he could enjoy as well, we arrived 830 on a saturday they were busy but had one free table we had prawns in spring onion pork in brown sauce and some vegetables  delicious service was impeccable v reasonably priced highly highly recommended they were completely shutting up by 930, a small hole in the wall restaurant in a unique part of town local spot with very very helpful staff menu is also in english  the sauces accompanying the dishes are amazing the duck pork and vegetables were fantastic all 5 of my family ate a full meal and it was $42 you cant go to starbucks for that with my family highly recommended have your hotel reserve a table and make sure you get them to write out the address in mandarin so your taxi can bring you up to the front door, this is a wonderful restaurant where the owners are foodies themselves they opened this restaurant to entertain their own friends so the food quality is good and to top it off they also do not add any msg reservations is a must otherwise you have to wait outside for a table service staff are patient and polite its a small cosy restaurant with good food, this was my fifth official meal in shanghai  we are staying downtown the restaurant was a delight from start to finish and by far my favorite thus far the staff is so sweet and accommodating and helpful the owner is a woman who is there bustling around making sure everything is in order the food was excellent it was a neat clean place in a mixed neighborhood in the french concession squeezed between a hodge podge of businesses and residents its not very big so call for a reservation if you are american or english speaking and you speak very slowly and spell things it works fine ive heard on weekends its hard to get in  i can see why  but we went on a weeknight the braised pork with a brown sauce and quail eggs was amazing the mushroom vegetable dish with bok choylike greens fantastic with a bit of the vinegar they leave on the table and the duck leg nearly melts in your mouth with those three dishes and noodles with fried scallions yummy we had plenty for two we also had a bottle of wine and the whole bill came to not even 60 us dollars note they do not take credit cards so dont get stuck  we didnt have enough yaun on us but they were so sweet about waiting for my husband to run around the corner to a money machine, we visited this restaurant on our first night in shanghai so the bar was set high and nothing lived up to it its a small family type restaurant with formica table tops owned by a taiwanese woman but the cuisine is shanghai madame helped us choose we had small white fried fish covered in crispy spicy scallions double cooked  belly pork with quail eggs in a rich and sticky sauce some delicious black mushrooms deep fried duck legs speciality rice balls in date skins souses asparagus stem and some crunchy kai lan all absolutely scrumptious we drank beer  and tea of course  but there is wine available too, this is the best shanghai cruisie that i have ever tasted in shanghai i just love the charming environment they served dishes 100 msg free the portion of the dishes are just good enough for a perfect meal not forgetting their ice tea its the best in town very reasonable priced do make reservationsplans before arriving the queue can be 2 hours long, great food the yellow fish on bamboo was wonderfully crunchy the shanghai pork belly and quail eggs scrumptious and the warm dates with glutinous rice were fab great atmosphere nice servicean original out of the way find in the french concession, found a review of this restaurant while in shanghai and it sounded great so we went
and it was its an unassuming little place that is extremely well run the owner is obviously very passionated about her restaurant the food is fresh and delicious the staff are great and as everyone else says its really fantastic value for your yuan we liked it so much we went twice in one week will definitely go again on my next visit to shanghai, we visited this restaurant after reading the article on timeout shanghai httpwwwtimeoutshanghaicomvenuerestaurantscafeschineseshanghainese7390jianguo328html and ordered the dishes that were well recommended there

without doubt this is some of the best food weve ever had for the prices charged im not terribly familiar with shanghaiese cuisine but i thought the flavours in each of the dishes was well balanced and exquisite the deepfried duck leg and yellow fish with scallions were particularly good

service was prompt and friendly we ate quite early at about 1730 and so the restaurant wasnt at all busy

in summary this restaurant is not to be missed if you are in shanghai and are after some high quality reasonably priced food go now before word gets out","bar",0.720516362981935
144,"rw visited salotto g for the first time during the restaurant week the selected menu was complete coherent and good list of starters we had the mozarella di buffala and the salmon both proved to be good choices to start then continued with our favorite gnocchi on mushrooms sauce  truffle aroma a great combination topped with the smell of truffle to accompany the dinner we ordered a bottle of sicilian red wine recommended by the manager a good choice smooth and with a particular finishing a bit earthy however overpriced for its quality and for being a very young wine 2014 i definitely prefer the cocktail i ordered antica negroni bitter and smokey with a burnt rosemary leaf in it
the main course were disappointing as i went for the red fish on tomato sauce which just tasted like tomato sauce and same case for the ox tail presented in a bowl plate that made it very difficult to cut honestly the main courses were lacked of presence and flavors
the desserts were very good specially we asked them to change one and had the apple pie instead which was very good
definitely will go back again to try more cocktails and to dine in a more casual way sitting at the bar with some antipasti and pizza slices, cool good and genuine
i loved the salotto g the food were excellent and the drinks to die for
when travelling alone on business i am looking for a cosy place and not the white tablecloth restaurant this is just the restaurant for you who look for a relaxed place with genuine italian food and cosy atmosphere i was dining in the bar but upstairs there is a dining area small dishes but good go there you will not be disappointed, nice ambience and the food was tasty and authentic this place is in an emerging area with lots of restaurants worth a visit, amazing place downstairs and also upstairs with this great terrasse food is awesome and the cocktails are delicious all products are super tasty definitely the best italian restaurant and one of the best cocktail bar in town definitely worth going
the boss and all the staff are lovely, went there for dinner and were greeted by the helpful staff started with their signature cocktails which were excellent and well presented
you can feel the food is made from high quality ingredients and the terrace is a perfect spot for romantic night under the cool shanghai september weather 
price is on the steep side but happy to spend a bit more for the quality of ingredients, i tried this place first a couple of weeks a go and i keep going back
the lounge downstairs has a cozy atmosphere with a nice intimate decor the italian tapas menu is comprehensive and i liked most items with a particular mention for their truffle tartar the cheese gnocchi and the ox tail simple food but really well done with a different twist to it these plates are nicely complemented by pizzas that can also be shared all for an affordable price the other special thing are the cocktails i tried the mr g which is really refreshing for summer and the feel like a boss which is more of strong evening cocktail with a nice smoky taste
upstairs you have a nice terrace protected by big tress which is not common in this neighborhood
they also have a room where you can have a private dinner with the chef cooking in front of you and for about 500 rmb i really was truly impressed i tried the cod menu 7 courses the truffle menu 5 courses and the surprise menu and in every instance i thought that they deserved a michelin star the food was really fantastic with great service in a wonderful setting for a group of 10+
i really recommend you try it worth the detour, the venue is simple and elegant i sat outside where the sun is very hot better avoid during the summer
set lunch includes starter main and dessert
warm and careful service

you can see the food is made by expert hands and and the taste of dishes has personality

ill be back to try tasting menu, tried for the first time the blind menu whereby the chef cooks a surprise menu in a dedicated kitchen just for you i have to say i didnt know what to expect and it was just amazing so if you like to surprised with great food and stellar service give it a try it will be worth it, i went there 2 times with some friends
1st was on what they call the lounge really nice terrace with trees surrounding it ordered cocktails and food for sharing special mention to mr g cocktail if you like it sweet and sour if you share take the cold cut and cheese platter for 46 people the cheese is really authentic and the mozzarella is a must try the gnocchi was really good and also the pinsas kind of small pizza
2nd time i went there was for diner they have another menu that change every here and then it was a 7 course menu not so much food but in the end we were really full and the food was amazing its more expensive though as the chef makes it depending the booking but what was nice is that the chef is cooking just besides the tables
prices are fair regarding the food more expensive for diner better for business dinner or dating but it worth it way more if you go in group for food sharing
ask to book in advance the atmosphere is really nice and cosy but it means not enough space and i was lucky to ask if i could book on the terrace and they do
really nice italian restaurant, i visited salotto g on my last trip in shanghai
it was on sunday evening and i have been lucky to experience the private room with my friends right beside the cute terrace at the second floor of this really cute venue

my friends were late so i wait for them at the bar located at the first floor
i was starving and asked for the snacks menu this restaurant offer
the manager an italian gentleman took good care and oriented me in some pairing for me to try also the cocktails drinks were pretty awesome and the snacks were beyond expectations
didnt see the time flying and my friends finally joined
since we were 12 the management offered us to go upstair for a more comfortable dinner and then to try that private room
so far the service was great food good and price pretty fair
also when we left the management guided us to the little corner shop at the entrance of the restaurant where they sell some of their authentic italian products they are cooking on site as the wines you can find in the drink list
great italian experience i will come back for sure, i discover this place during my last business trip  just went for a coffee  and i felt so good that i stayed 6 hours and try their dish first time i experience this kind of italian food  great surprise  i loved it  cant wait to try next time chef table during next trip  they also have amazing cocktail food is better to share look like italian tapas place unfortunatly was rainning so i could not the terrace but look cool too, finally a complete italian concept with both casual and formal dining options service was nice tried one feel like a boss and was impressed the ancient roman pinsa is amazing and so different from standard pizza the tartare was superb nice touch the market corner where i got 2 bottles of ca del bosco prosecco
look forward to trying the upstairs chefs table menu
definetely worth trying, there some really good and even great italian restaurants in shanghai  nene top chef and mamma mia  but there are still much more not so good italian restauranta with often poor ingredients  inconsistent quality of preparations and tumbling service  some of them everpresent and overrated and overpriced in the media and the social networks despite not matching the announcements and expectations

with salotto g just opened we get here a fourth great representative of what italian cuisine should be and it comes at a really stunning level of quality 

the place is a cosy elegant house on wuding lu downstairs with a view on the kitchen a little more relaxed  upstairs with even more style for sure a romantic place to impress your date 

the shanghai experienced italian host gives you a sense of perfect italian hospitality  we shared four dishes  brandade garlic flavored stockfish mash raw beef tartare with truffles and quail egg homemade gnocchi style pasta in a flavorful but subtle truffle cream sauce with crunch of parmaham  braised sirloin steak in tomato sauce 

on this evening at salotto g we experienced the beauty of excellent italian cuisine which is centered around the perfect quality of the ingredient and the precision of preparation specially the cooking time the real amazing quality of the meat and the other ingredients was stunning and worth the price which emains surprisingly reasonable  the nice approach of the italian chef and his team is that they serve 100 authentic italian dishes but have a little more refined and subtle preparation and flavoring and put them with a hint of more upscale presentation  in this way you sense all the warmth and flavor of the rustic italian recipes but with the pleasure of fine dining

the service is very thoughtful polite and considerate and gave us perfect advice on what to choose  we did not try the vines as we were still jetlagged just a negroni which i would rank as one of the 2 or 3 best in town

it is for sure little more formal and elegant than the normal trattoria where one likes to go with kids and family  but for a relaxed evening among befriended couples or your date  the best new place of the year 2016 until now , very nice and cosy place in jingan not far from the cbd and nearby some nice residential campounds the terrace and private dinner room are excellent the service is efficient and friendly food quality is italian fusion and worth to try compare of having a pizza and pasta in a local italian restaurant regarding the cons price and location a bit too much but the quality follows and regarding the location its ideal for weekend and evening but i wont have time to go there during weekdays lunch time","cafe",0.999260918114974
145,"nice experience in this restraint and the chief is very nice person ive order home
made spaghetti and my friend order home made lasagna with bolognese sauce the soup is very classic italy style so if u like it i should order one the dessert is fantastic  love it
however i have bad sense of direction so the way is very hard to find u should ask passenger of someone else, the food is good well cooked and with the correct mix of creative tastes the choice is various maybe a little bit too much to have all perfect
the room is too noisy isnt my first experience there because the level of music is higher than normal and people starts speaking loudy, excellent food and service with a warm welcome from the italian born owner who frequently checked on us himself throughout the meal brought us complimentary champagne and talked to us about the story of his restaurant the atmosphere was one of warmth and welcome italian food after 2 weeks of chinese fare, if you feel to get a taste of italian dish then you need to go and see porto matto in shanghai not big but great not bright but sunny feeling not special but special taste italian cooking like from mamas hand no special recommendation everything is worth to order and try meat appetizer fish homemade noodles yummy yummy yummy you get a good selection of wine and other drinks as well and the best thing roberto treat you like a king hes not a replica of an italian guy hes a real italian buon appetito , i was brought here by a friend of mine and with surprise i discovered that the cook comes from my area in italy we could taste his dishes like insalata di mare seafood salad tuna steak grilled mixed seafood pasta dishes all of them were very tasty after talking a bit more deeply with the owner he explained to me the challenges of teaching the chinese how to eat real italian as well as the challenges he has to get fresh and real italian ingredients the quality of his food is very good and as italian i would not doubt one minute to come back there good luck roberto, this is the most welcoming restaurant in shanghai more than any other italian and the chef really makes the guests feel at ease its my shelter in the city whenever i want to feel home i go there for a coffee a bitter or a pizza, after more than 2 years of regular visits i have decided its time now to rate this restaurant
roberto never fails in suggesting the fresh dishes of the day
the menu is very comprehensive of all kinds of italian dishes with a special care for the specialities from apulia region
just ask the chef what is not in the menu today for example award winning fish and onion calzone
long live porto matto, well i was not impressed by this restaurant and will not go back although i may not be welcome after this  first of all kids were running around all the tables screaming like we were in the middle of a kinder garden with no one stopping them it was 830pm on a thursday night and it didnt make the restaurant feel very warm and cosy then the head chef thought it was funny to tell some gay jokes to one of the other guests on my table  i am a gay man and did not find them funny at all then the food came and the pasta was dry i heard that this restaurant was good but i am sorry there was nothing i could find except the decor that was good the wine was nice ill give you that also i suggest when you dont know the customer dont tell gay jokes which were not funny ones please check your audience , good pizzas and pasta meat and steak sometimes hit or miss they serve nice free bread and a glass of sparkling wine to dinner guests although they seem to not offer all guests at all times lots of regulars and only busy when theres a group party, pastas with refreshing and very flavorful arrabiata sauce pizzas with flavorful toppings delicate veal with lemon sauce finally found an italian restaurant in shanghai serving authentic food that you could be enjoying in italy, one of the best italian restaurants in shanghai the pizza salad and carpaccio was really good but the gnocchi with four cheese sauce were brilliant also the bill was moderate for european food the price was not cheap but ok so if you want to go for some real italian food in shanghai porto matto is a great option, my ukrainian friend who lives in china took me there 3 months ago and i had one of the best risotto so i took my colleague there during this trip we started with a thin crust pizza to share my colleague who loves pizza said it was probably one of the best pizza hes had in a long time i thought it lacked seasoning but i agreed that the crust was good it can afford a little bit more salt he ordered the lasagna and i ordered the squid ink risotto the mozzarella cheese us sorta yellow both on the pizza and on the lasagna the lasagna wasnt very memorable but the squid ink risotto was a pretty amazing the rice was just beyond al dente which is how i like it the rice is this beautiful ink black color and it was so flavorful i believe they added chopped squid while cooking and somehow the squid wasnt too tough from cooking they added some sauteed shrimp on top which was decent but i did not taste any thyme in the thyme flavor oil drizzled on top of the dish but all and all it was a fantastic dish i would definitely go back again

at one point of the evening the dinning room become super smoky like the smoke alarm should go off smoky the waiter said their ventilation isnt working too well especially when the kitchen is preparing steak i hope they get that fixed quickly, i visited the restaurant with a group of italian friends and we tried several dishes
being the owner and chef from bari it was obvious that the orecchiette were at their best while other things were not the top but not bad
the service was so and so but overall kind, i visited porto matto for sunday lunch the restaurant is a modest size and wasnt busy at the time of my visit the menu has a wide choice from pizza  pasta to fish  steak meals my pasta was well cooked and tasty i also had generous serving of dessert service was polite and efficient","Healthy",0.673233458056087
146,"executive summary

pros  slightly thicker dumpling but meatier than jia jia big menu in case you want something beyond xlb tasty food at cheap prices local joint

cons  not too clean decor is best described as aged

top tip  order at the till pay then sit down you will have to either ask for a spoon or buy a soup or noodle so they automatically give you a spoon a weird problem but ive been here twice and twice i ordered the duck blood soup mainly to have a bowl and a spoon

try the duck blood soup its a local delicacy

overall i really enjoyed the xlbs here and would return again and again thanks for a positive experience, wonderful restaurant delicious chinese food at very reasonable prices great service and location im a charming older building that feels very warm and relaxing note that the menu is all in chinese so youll need to use a translation app if you cant read chinese, the most democratic of restaurants in shanghai and with good reason not only is fuchun one of the oldest restaurants in the mega city but it is one of the most reasonably priced the traditional xiaolong bao are the house speciality and shouldnt be missed out on dont be put off by the soya stained plastic bowls theyve safely fed 1000s of people with no maladies they now also have an english menu and english speaking staff at the counter try to notice the vibration of the metro as it passes below all part of the quaint charm of this local favourite, if i would try to label this it would be as my headline says a shanghainese diner this place gets crowded the food is excellent the xialongbao is very good any of the noodle soups are a hit and so is the fried pork chop the menu is in chinese only bring a chinese friend or take a chance and point to the menu, ive had a lot of people tell me fuchun has the best xiaolongbao in shanghai a well respected brand with the citys specialty dish is not something to take lightly i went at off peak hours because i knew itd be crowded otherwise i went at 330 pm on a sunday and snagged an available seat pretty quickly the skin of the dumplings was fairly thick and the soup inside was alright they were much larger and thicker than dintaifungs version dont get me wrong they were still great but not the best ive ever had maybe ill give them another shot, i was here oct 13 2016 fully agree nice suburbs of shanghai great place for a great but cheap bite thanks to the comments i understood that we had to order and pay first we ordered the dumplings first on the menu above the cassiere dumplings yes pork beef and crab
then i ordered 4 samosa baked dumplings with vegetables in it as well as 2 budweisers 06l all for 92 y which currently is around 13 euro
fantastic food, this place came highly recommended by some shanghai friends so i wanted to love these we had the pork dumplings and chicken i think the skin is thicker than din tai fung and jia jia tang bao but it is cheaper too not all of the dumplings had soup which was a bit disappointing maybe we just had a bad batch worth a visit as it seems popular with locals and we enjoyed sharing tables with the locals, get the dumplings with soup inside xiaolongbao and zhazhupai pan fried pork steak this place is an unexpected hidden but multiawarded and dirty small restaurant where you can enjoy the traditional shanghainese cuisine i really enjoy eat every time, its a small restaurant in jing an area where you can meet young couple of students old couple of shanghainese very normal people eating one of the most traditional dish in shanghai xiaolongbao meaning steamed dumplings with some broth inside basically slow cooking over steamer the meat inside release an amazing jiucy broth be careful and wait for the dumpling to cool a little

its very simple place where you order at counter and wait for your food to arrive often sitting in a shared table with other guest that makes the experience even ore interesting as you can easily find inspiration for your next order

apart from xialongbao try cutlet zhupai or whatever you see around despite the place could be cleaner food is delicious and ive been going there once per week for many years, is it worth it the moment you arrive you are greeted with pushy chinese people all waiting for a table there is no order here as order takes a back seat to old traditional chaos and disorganization you have to fend for yourself to get a table and once you do dont plan on ordering at the tableoh yes the menu is in all chinese luckily i was able to navigate the waters with my chinese girlfriend she stood at the front picked out food and i safeguarded the table from attacking chinese who just want to take the space the waitress was even fighting with her because the waitress forgot one of our xiao long bao orders and tried to get out of it by asking how much we paid for everythinghahanice people huh ofcourse we had the receipt and showed them and they stilled didnt bring it to us right away so we did what spiteful guests will do we finished our lunch and we sat until the brought us our ordered and paid for portion the place was very busy so it was in their best interest now to get us out so others can sit we didnt leave the order finally came we ate we sat more and then left this place had great specialty shanghai food but who cares you can get that at din tai feng avoid this place its not even friendly to the locals, until i ate here i always considered jia jia tang bao on huanghe lu to be the best xiaolongbao in town

fu chun is the best with a substantial skin that is thin and yet holds its integrity and a filling that you can dream about for days it is the new champion in my book the soup is delicious and the ratio of meat to soup and skin is sublime

the best in the city, the xialongbao was good and very cheap we were surprised that the xiaolongbao skin was thicker than what we are used to other chinese restaurants but it was filling and satisfying

however since there was no english menu we cannot order anything else we planned to just point to some peoples food but the line was long that when it was our turn the other people already finished their food this place gets crowded near lunch time so it is better to go earlier also be prepared to share your table with someone especially during crowded hours

note the place is a little far from the station but you just need to walk along the same street i do not know if there is a better route but we got off at jiangsu rd at metro line 2 then just walked along yuyuan road until we reached zhening road we passed by st lukes hospital if you want a landmark but you still need to walk a little further once you reached zhening just take a look around the shopsrestaurants across the street and you will find fuchun, wow what an experience went there alone on my first night in shanghai didnt expected that since so many people wrote about it on tripadvisor two things people should know going there the first time
1 order right when you enter the restaurant they dont come to the table and take your order they will look friendly at you but they wont come  
i was sitting there quite a while

2 dont expect any english i had to point at other peoples tables to show what i want to eat

but the xiaolongbao were delicious and the service was really friendly
i will definitely go there again highly recommendable, this local restaurant in the jingan district serves stunningly good xiaolongbaos much better than what you will in the tourist traps in yu gardens it is as good if not better than the very famous din tai fung chain in my humble opinion

fuchun caters for the locals and the menu is chinese only but the lady who takes the orders only knows three english words crab roe and pork if you like to order something else and dont know chinese the local patrons will be happy to help you out, certainly the best xiaolongbao in town i stayed near the restaurant when i was in china in december i had been there about 6 times and waitress can even recognized me try to be there in morning around 800 or after lunch time otherwise it will be very crowd i only tried xiaolongbao and spring roll both are very good i had tried xiaolongbao over many different places this one is the best if you are concerned about the sanitization try to bring your own chopsticks as did, the place is always crowded and you have to share table with other people not so clean they use wet cloth to wipe the table also i notice they didnt clean the bamboo steaming basket for the new order because i notice few left over pieces of food on the basket
despite all these bad points in which are kind of normal in china their xlb is pretty good although i feel the skin is a little thick but thats really alright the most important part is the taste anyway
since i went alone so i just ordered 6 xlb and 1 cold dish of cucumber im pretty sure their other menu must taste good too i will try the other dishes if i have the opportunity, walked in to this gem of a restaurant after perusing through the shanghai propaganda art center the private museum with maoera posters for your enjoyment

saw the long line outside and remembered my colleagues wise words places with long lines typically have great food

cost less than 40 rmb for two people we ordered xiaolongbao and wonton soup and were very happy and filled

the only caveat is you have to order in mandarin and getting a table might be challenging, i can only rate the xiaolongbao soup filled dumplings with pork i think because thats the only thing i was prepared to order i went here with 2 other people one person spoke very little mandarin and none of the restaurant workers speak english the dumplings are great but i wanted to try more things from this restaurant the menu had pictures but not for each item if you know someone who can translate or order for you in chinese i would recommend doing that or just ordering the xiaolongbao

we walked into an extremely crowded restaurant which was a little overwhelming after we got our bearings we ordered 3 orders of the xiaolongbao at the door we paid 8 yuan $133 each and received 2 flimsy paper tickets one ticket was pink and the other was green with chinese characters and the number 1 on one ticket and 2 on the other

we tried looking for a seat but like i said the restaurant was crowded you just have to sit wherever there is an opening even if its at a table with complete strangers in any case we couldnt find a place to sit where the three of us could sit together we stood around for a bit to determine what to do we just decided to get the dumplings to go so we handed our tickets to one of the workers and waited for about 20 minutes to get our order

we got our order which comes with 6 dumplings bite a small piece of the outer part of the dumpling be careful because the soup inside is very hot suck out the soup and devour the dumpling, this place is a must if you like xiao long bao i have been around shanghai for the past few months checking out all the xiao long bao places and this one comes to the very top it is a little thicker skin than most but definitely not a bad thing because the broth in these lil bao is the best, no fuss eatery serving local xiaolongbao original has thick skin  ok to my tastebuds but popular with the locals crab roe xiaolongbao has more soup and is more flavourful double mushroom noodles was good dont expect any service or enquiry answered","vegetarian restaurant",0.999836797850759
147,"we enjoyed a nice meal the restaurant looks fantastic the staff were terrific the wide selection of starters we ordered was delicious including a free extra brought over by the chef herself then the table converts to a bbq with the addition of hot coals you can either cook yourself or we had our waitress cook ours for us fun and tasty, surprisingly quiet for a friday eveningdecent service decent food but a bit devoid of atmosphere and essentially overpriced for effectively raw ingredients that you cook yourself
having said that we enjoyed the food and experience pretty decent but suffers overall on value, after mixing up our booking at marcato upstairs  they found us a table at chiq on level 2 this is certainly one of the best kept secrets in shanghai  we ordered the set menu warily for 499 rmb pp and again the food was superb and really the best of the menu and hearty we loved the bbq megaprawns in the middle of the table  and the chocolate desert was sensational we will definitely return, i had a good meat here and grilled korean style
good place if you are looking for a korean bbq style
little over price and the wine lost is not the best but i had a good dinner, fantastic korean bbq
nice seats not crowded
very good diner
friendly staff
i have enjoyed a lot my stay there and will for sure come back, i guess our expectations were up about this place but we did not leave feeling very satisfied
the atmosphere is decent although they could turn up the lights a bit also the washroom was really cold in comparison to the rest of the restaurant
basically it is way overpriced for the quality of the food for example for about 33 usd the ribeye you get four small unimpressive tasting pieces of meat the chicken was dry and the vegetables in some cases were too oily the gyu kaku chain is better in my opinion
also the waitress who was cooking the food in front of us gave me a piece of undercooked chicken and because it is so dark in the restaurant we had to use our iphone light to see if the chicken was cooked all the way through lol
the best part of the meal was the side dishes and the dessert, capitalizing on celebrity chef jeangeorges vongerichtens fame and run by his korean wife chef marja chiq kimchi + bbq  get it aims at serving highend korean food the decor is indeed very chic nightclub like in fact a bit too dark sadly the food is neither very satisfying nor authentic for example the pajeon korean pancakes  are supposed to be crispy on the outside but soft and moist inside and full of fresh vegs here theyre just like crispy flour the foie gras bibimbap is too bland the beef is either not or undermarinated unless youre an ang moh unfamiliar with korean cuisine or a young shanghainese in search of hip youd be better off at a traditional korean joint, been here to have dinner the service is amazing the food is super and the environment is also very glamour and chic everything is at top level but you need more light in it i had to make some light with my iphone to check the t of the meat, if your looking for authentic korean food  this isnt the place but if your looking to go on a nice date and enjoy korean this would be the spot i wouldnt go again unless im taking a first time date or something, the food in this restaurant is amazing and had great service chef marja is extremely creative with the korean food and offers great vegetarian options too the bbq mushrooms were simply amazing and they had a great exhaust system which does let any smoke or smell come up the best part of it all is that the bbq happens on your table itself
we had the silken tofu veggie bim bim bop veggie jap chai noodles and the mushroom bbq the food overall was amazing and the best korean food i have eaten
an amazing experience and a must do in shanghai, this was our first restaurant in shanghai so we didnt really have many points of reference however we spent a wonderful evening at this place the menu features creative recreations of traditional korean and east asian dishes the wine list was fairly good service was truly excellent waiters went really outoftheway to make sure we had the perfect dining experience to me the only possible downside is that the place was a bit pricey for my taste other than that highly recommendable, to say the least  it was sensational food what a find

we enjoyed aust wagyu +9 shabushabu along with many other selections
all the dishes appeared carefully creative looks alone were satisfying  to taste they were never disappointing

the service was great  everyone enjoyed the attentiveness from the staff

all in all it was hard to find a fault with food the service or the atmosphere , i have been quite few times during my visits to shanghai it is not the super traditional bbq style but a nice compromise between classical and fusion place is a bit dark to understand what you are cooking but that is part of the concept i love arriving early and sit at the bar sipping a cocktail very well done by the staff, ive been craving korean for awhile  and couldnt ask for more when i ended up at chiq

everything was there  from bibimbaps  korean fried chicken  rice cakes and best of all the yakiniku

having jeangeorge run this establishment certainly didnt come unnoticed  as i have tried a very unusual dish  a fois gras bibimbap  a french take on the korean classic  and what a dish 

highly recommended, it is already the third time that i enjoy a gourmet korean cuisine at chiqit is just great what they proposethe small spicy dishes of vegetables as appetizers are delicioustry the tartare beef on roasted bread and the korean bbq cooked as you wish on natural charcoalthe meet is really tender and tasteful and goes well with soju served well chilledthe service is fast and thoughtfula good place to try even if you know nothing about korean cuisineprices are mild, this is a great restaurant to go to for fusion korean and a little bit of bbq the atmosphere is great modern decor nice fresh ingredients and a menu with some interesting dishes

i have always been with big groups and it accommodates us well

service is excellent accommodating and very helpful it can always be a bit of a nightmare serving large groups but the staff took everything in their stride

i went with a couple of abks  and they said that there are better bbq restaurants in shanghai  but if you are lazy and looking for a consistently good option then this would be it

it is a big restaurant so i have never had trouble getting in  even without a reservation, back in 70s bromley there was a novel restaurant called on the table where you cooked your own steaks on a grill in the centre of the table this is the korean equivalent where you sit in a slightly sunken well with a pot full of hot coals in the centre and cook your own we had the basic tasting menu starting with some variable nibbles picked cabbage mushrooms etc i added an extra of sashimi which was very good the crispy dumplings were ok the marinaded meat was just ok and designed to be eaten with rice and spicy sauce in a lettuce wrap overall not very exciting but reasonable value, we have been there twice but both time the experience was for some point nothing special quite in the average even if the expectations were quite high
both time we found the restaurant almost empty and it is not a good sign despite few people the waiters were always too fast making the dining experience like a fast food one overpriced for the quality of the food they serve and the quality of the service they provide but the location is very good in the same building of unico  mercato, the first thing they will ask you here is if it is a first visit one of the managers guided us through briefly explained the menu and gave some recommendations my husband and i chose the discovery sharing menu which is at 198 rmb per person plus some meat extras from the a la carte selections once the bbq meats arrived the same manager offered to show us how to do it the service here is topnotch very attentive and proactive the friendly lady manager also approached us and talk about the restaurant while she was doing the grilling for us their exhaust system is amazing all the barbecue smoke is ventilated under the floors you will leave the restaurant without a trace of barbecue smell that is why their seats are one foot down  extra precautions are needed as the lighting is quite dim as for the food need i say more from the banchan to the meat marinades everything is excellent i have been to jgs mercato twice and my expectations in chiq are definitely exceeded

also i advise to make dining reservation as early as possible especially during weekends we did book however the availability is only at 8 pm on a saturday night, if you have experienced korean bbq in korea the usa or even in shanghai for that matter you will be very disappointed with chiq because it is exactly the same except the price is about 3x more we were excited to try chiq but were not impressed with the lack of food creativity we also found the dining hall strange it feels like you are in a prison with concrete walls wood floors spare decoration and very low lighting the meal starts with the traditional side dishes again no asian fusion or anything out of the ordinary there was one kind of kimchi that we were given even it wasnt extraordinary it was good but not special the australian beef for the bbq was high quality which we appreciated i did like the cocktail menu and had an interesting drink that was nicely presented overall we were disappointed in this restaurant and its lack of effort the food was good but not unique, all jg restaurants are great and this is no exception great food great service great ambiance theres no view of the bund from this restaurant but the prices are also more affordable than some of the more swanky bund restaurants, chiq is a very modern and stylish korean bbq place and they use charcoal which i prefer by far to the gas ones the service recommended 1 starter and 1 basket per person but as the portions are rather small its probably more like 15 each our group of 3 shared 3 starters of which the bibimbop with the foie gras was quite nice after we shared 4 different baskets which were all ok but nothing i will remember for long on the same floor next door is the barclub which comes handy if you want to follow up with a few drinks i might come back but it wont be priority, nice restaurant for korean food and bbq fine dining visited the restaurant with friends

the grill meat was very nice the staff very helpful and understand the food very well most of them are bilingual can speak english so dont worry if you dont know much on the food shown in menu

the ambient is nice whether for hanging out with friends or with family or business colleagues, this was a return visit and i have to say it maintained the standard excellent quality food in a modern upmarket setting  staff were very attentive and could not do more to help make it a memorable experience 

wagu and pork meats are excellent as is everything else we have tried from the menu

as for staff charles ren made our night special he picked up on the conversation that there was a birthday at the table and in addition to excellent service managed to provide a birthday surprise

this is now on our list of favourite restaurants in shanghai and after 12 years living here it is a difficult list to get on to , stylish but uncomfortable restaurant my back needs support but none of the chairs or benches offered support over a few inches above the seat i was miserably uncomfortable throughout the meal we were sitting in a cold breeze and the bathroom was bitterly cold the food was good but no better than other korean restaurants with much more reasonable prices the service was rather brittle and awkward i wont be going back, elegant design nice atmosphere and welcoming waiters great food and complementary rice beer as welcome drink  it is a great place for an evening with friends , we celebrated our 11th anniversary here while on a business trip to shanghai its hard to resist anything jean georges is associated with and we were eager to try this new restaurant which he launched with his wife chic ambiance hip crowd the food is beautifully presented in particular we enjoyed the barbecued veggies tended by a lovely hostess and the bi bim bop topped with foie gras how can you go wrong its spendy its pretty its yummy great korean in shanghai, we had dinner here with 2 other friends the restaurant was rather empty maybe cause it was late it was almost 930pm the restaurant ambience was nice  welcoming
i liked the way the menu was prepared  we had a staff a trainee explained the menu to us in detail she gave suggestions  was very friendly
food was good with nice presentation she even offered to do the barbecue for us i liked the way the barbecue was set up very interesting
service was excellent
had a great night  look forward to coming again, i love meat i love grilled meat therefore i also love korean bbq
i love drinking and clubbing
chiq is the attempt of combining a cool korean bbq with a cool adjacent bar which in my opinion doesnt work well i dont go drinking when my hair and clothes are smelly from the bbq
while i disagree with the concept  their combination beef platter is priced acceptably but the a la carte prices are rather steep food quality is very good try the beef tartare as appetizer, after many delays it was up n running at last i cant fault the place beautifully set up awesome bar feels like stepping into a 6 stars place
greeted by the assistant restaurant manager a korean i was led by him to my table feeling like a king because i personally know the restaurant manager myself shirley n her boss he oversees the whole jean georges sisters restaurant including mercato italian eatery
as shirley was away kim assistant manager suggested i go for the degustation
no regrets it makes the evening a very satisfying meal from korean pancakes to sashimi to rice cake korean noodles raw crab with massive roe n finished off with a delightful korean bbq n leave me a happy man with korean sake tasting thrown in  complimentary, absolutely different concept of korean bbq dinner with style was welcome to a bar of waiting guests though we have all made reservations but still have to wait for our tables many would order a drink at the bar as it was about 1015min wait for our table wasnt pleased with the bars service though they have good club music but was very impressed with the professional service of the waiter and waitress that served our table they would introduce patiently our course how we should eat it though we already how korean bbq works they kinda kneel at the low table while serving at times they were helpful with the wine pairing as did their best as it was our first time there making sure we enjoyed the great hospitality and making sure we would go back again saw the great but petite lady chef of chiq a disciple of jean george upstairs if you have eaten at jean georges you will notice chiq did something similar to the desserts as well like their fusion style in appetizers too we will sure visit them again, good atmosphere great selection and good quality on food service was good and prompt prices were fair

we enjoyed our dinner at chiq and i if you are in for some korean bbq and bibimbap i would recommend this restaurant location is good and close to the action if you look to continue the night on the barsclubs around the bund, we enjoyed dinner experience here very much
we had a business dinner for the group of 7 people

1 service was excellent and very fast
2 cost it is expensive since chiq is a high end establishment by jeangeorges vongerichten so we paid 5300cny with drinks this article talks about why he is offering his take on korean food
httpwwwkoreatasteorglangenenmagazineeninterviewsenjeangeorgesandstopandbopkorea
3 food was very good grilling is fun but that also means that you can overcookundercook it so you should make sure to put the right person in charge of watching the flames , believe it or not we struggled a little to find somewhere we fancied eating on the bund in town for just two nights we wanted to enjoy ourselves

many other restaurants were a little too westernised for usplenty of that at home chiq did not disappointvery cool bar area with a fantastic bar tenderdidnt get his name but was incredibly and justifiably proud of his cocktail creations of which we enjoyed a few before dining

semisunken tables house a hot coal burner for which the coals are brought together with your choice of food to cook yourselfgreat fun and just fantastic

the only minor point was a bottle of voss water at around <u+00a3>8will watch out for that next time but it certainly didnt impact on the evening

would highly recommendwe were only twowould be great with a larger group, lets not beat around the bush chiq is priceyextremely pricey good place to impress your date and your business associates

luckily for us the restaurant agm was a friend of my dining guest and he took care of us foodwise from appetizers to the korean bbq to dessert nothing went wrong pairing the food with hendricks gt or sojuthe tastes and flavors melded

ambience was livelythe service staff attentive they managed the grill leaving us good time to chat and laugh i want to go back again this eveningbut unfortunately not in shanghai anymore, i lived in korea for about a year and fell in love with korean food although this place is pricey and not extremely traditional i still thought the food was amazing our overall experience was great the staff was extremely attentive but not annoying we ordered the king fish sashimi that melts in your mouth the beef basket the lamb with kimchi butter and the seasonal mushroom basket the beef was extremely high quality

i am not really a fan of kimchi or soju however when in a korean restaurant i tend to order it we ordered the house soju which was so smooth i didnt even need to mix it with my beer soju usually makes me cringe with every sip but this was enjoyable and the kimchi was not too spicy or overpowering it was just the right mix

the ambience is beautiful and it is a real dining experience i would recommend this restaurant for any type of special occasion or a great date night it is one of the best restaurants i have been to, a very nice ambiente and good food staff is friendly and helpful and speaks good english
i like the bbq, this was the second time we eat at chiq returning primarily due to the combination of high quality food ingredients modern ambience and great service recommend the steak tartar starter and the black pork set though everything we tried was pretty good pricing is upper end for shanghai as to be expected given the location, great location great ambience but i just felt the food nothing in particular impressive which is the same as many other korean bbq service was a bit slow maybe they were too busy we ended up a digestive in mercato as its just up stair, this was our 6th visit and the experience was still excellent it was my wifes birthday and we decided to go to her current favourite restaurant in shanghai

the staff ably led by tedd park the asst gm were efficient and friendly and the ambience was great

foodwise the quality was still there the australian short rib and the beijing black pork slices were delicious when grilled while the scallops prawns salmon and calamari were very fresh if anything we would have wished for more actually the freeflow lettuce and sauce was also welcome

the complimentary salad was okay as was the condiments such as kimchi my fave and daikon slices we did miss the kingfish carpaccio from previous occassions the rice cakes were a bit of a let down though although the sauce was great

for starters we had the steak tartar on crispy rice  unremarkable really  and rice cracker cluster tuna which was nice the sriracha helped to spice things up

dessert of sago with ice cream was the highlight and a good ending to the meal, loved this place forgot how much i love korean food this place is achingly cool  a superfashionable and dark dining room with recessed seating and grill pits in the middle of the tables the service was superb and the food genuinely superlative  the silken tofu a yoghurty delight the sashimi with avocado just a giant win delicious the main event is unquestionably the grill and the seafood basket we ordered consisted of some calamari some beautiful salmon some huge tiger prawns and some other bits my only complaint was that there wasnt enough of it we also ordered the mushroom basket and this was like fungi heaven  enoki oyster field shiitake etc plus a few others i wasnt familiar with all were stunning and had very distinct tastes  sweet earthy savoury etc all amazing as with the fish the grill was perfect  it is such a nice concept and very sociable i really enjoyed it my business partner did too

no this isnt cheap but then great things rarely are nine quid for a bottle of fizzy water taking things a little too far but this is normal in shanghai and i dare say would be more expensive in dubai i wish we had korean bbq of this quality and stature here in dubai, we have ever been to very classy but still personal service outstanding and although not cheap worth every penny, we had our anniversary dinner at chiq and it was absolutely great the service was suitable for such a restaurant the food itself is really nice and tasty it is only barbecue but with the right choices of ingredients even a quite simple name can be yummy
we spend a great evening here and enjoyed it absolutely

definitely a place we will visit again, my and my husband went there for dinner there two set lunch its quite affordable for the bund area restaurants we actually didnt really expect that it would be so good having korean backgrounds and having lived in korea for a while i was impressed the interior design is very minimalist but very classy the presentation is just beautiful the chief of the restaurant gave us a signature salad for free as a warm welcome in total we had around 7 dishes and we were reasonably fool i dont mean like full when you cant move but full hen you are able to fall asleep without a stomach ache beef bbq was fantastic with different variation of panchan and of course kimchi yummy the best part was a dessert mmmm it was just simply perfect
after visiting chiq i told all my friends to try it, this korean fusion does the classic korean dishes with flair and a slight twist the presentation of the dishes was beautiful service was not as good as expected but the tasty dishes and decent portions made up for thatif you are very hungry you will want to get a rice or noodle dish desserts were also very tasty, crab and sugar snap pea salad with avocado was the highlight of the dishes ordered
grainfed beef basket was in good quality
seafood basket consisted of 2 prawns 2 scallops  2 minisize salmon and calamari was a disappointment
salad and rice were served free

as reminded by fellow reviewers we requested a smokefree table far away from bar due to my allergy however upon our arrival we were asked to wait at the bar for 10 minutes where people were smoking free tables were there but staffs were just busy around afterwards we were arranged to sit directly and immediately next to the bar we related our request once again as we spotted a free table far away from bar so it took us another 510 minutes in the middle of smoke before we could settle in what a considerate service

it�s a korean restaurant on the bund by jean georges couple so don�t expect value for money, there are myriads of cheap and cheerful korean restaurants in shanghai but chiq is in a very different class
great atmosphere superb service not cheap but the experience quality of food and service is well worth it

we went not knowing they had a restaurant week menu they just won newcomer award rmb258person was good value for money, and gems as we know are not cheap dinner for 2 with a couple of small beers each came to rmb1500 more down to earth korean restaurants are 13 the price so you pay a lot for the decor and excellent service

worth it for a treat but for regular korean dining i would try elsewhere

i booked via the website but didnt ever get a reply to that my booking was in there but the website says they will confirm and they didnt not that it mattered the place was empty at 1800, another winner by jean george although this time its his wifes project
love the contemporary interior the staff were attentive knowledgable and there were lots of them
loved cooking at the table and the ventilation must be excellent as there is no signs of smoke
the dipping sauces and nibbles with the food were delicious choices of seafood meat chicken vegetables and pork to choose from we went for a mix and all were good
really looking forward to making this a regular haunt the staff really excelled, this was one of my wifes favourite restaurants for shanghai restaurant week she especially loved the plum saketini

everything was impressive on the night the restaurant is laid out well and also has long communal tables for larger groups service was exceptional as can be expected from one of jean georges and his wifes eateries

the complimentary salad was nice but could have been a smaller portion the kingfish sashimi was delicious and fresh we went for both the seafood and the beef baskets the produce was very fresh and tasted great after grilling my wife felt full at the end but i was hoping for slightly bigger portions even the rice was served in only one small bowl as i am a big guy but do understand that at the price paid for restaurant week that might not be possible

the desserts were also well presented and tasty

my wife was so impressed that she was taking photos of the dishes as we were eating and sending to friends and beginning to organise a group dinner here
so it is safe to say that we will definitely be back

they also have an excellent air venting system as after the meal we did not have the smell of grilled meatfish on our clothes","Turkish cuisine",0.859145309894973
149,"one of the best meals i had in shanghai every thing was done perfectly with subtle nuances this restaurant group also owns a few adjacent locations in historic buildings that are quite famous as well, executive summary visited in jan17 lunch

pros  incredible spacious zenlike interior attentive staff clean toilets great innovative vegetarian dishes tasty food beautiful presentation decent value

cons  location but all the fu restaurants are on this street hard to secure a table

top tip  the less expensive tasting menu is the one to go for it provides the same number of course but using more local common ingredients whilst still providing a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable experience use the extra cash to get drinks elsewhere afterwards

overall this was a fantastic vegetarian tasting menu experience i would go back anytime thanks for a positive experience, all i can do is rave about our experience here the food staff wine decor were absolutely amazing the thought behind the vegetarian menu was so careful and creative everything was so beautifully executed to us the value for money was brilliant, the food is original and the set menus the only option offer a range of flavours that are truly unique
the service is the best i have experienced in shanghai, great food cannot complain the taste food portions too tiny

came during lunch had to choose from 380660880 set lunch each person must choose the same set  you cant order 380 set lunch and your friend order 880 set lunch, read a lot of articles about this restaurant so decided to try it during my last trip to shanghai

it did not measure up to my expectation both for food quality and service

all dishes were well presented however they tasted average after finishing the whole meal i did not recall any dishes that impressed me

for service it just like a nearby restaurant except they were more polite the just grab away the finished dish by hand without using the service tray serving another dish whilst you were still eating

environment was good they gave you a big private room even there were 2 guests you could relax and enjoy the privacy, i was here with my wife we enjoyed so much the place the staff is very polite and speaks perfect english the decor is beautiful very minimalist chinese stile we had a beautiful private room for the food they only have fixed menus we choose the sammer menu with eight courses it was fabulous we enjoyed each bite of it
this is a well deserved 55, superb restaurant the fact that it is vegetarian is purely incidental definitely a must visit for all foodies the chef is a true master of his craft

you have to choose from a few set menus  no a la carte and its quite steep on the pocket but definitely a superb experience well worth every penny, i had at fu he hui the most amazing vegetarian chinese cuisine the quality of the food service and ambiance is outstanding it definitely comes with a high price tag but its absolutely worth it
i highly recommend this place, ive eaten there twice you dont even miss meat the dishes are artfully prepared fantastic service food ambience, i never expect too much from chinese vegetarian food because it is just a lot of flavoring and additive in processed soya and flour to me this restaurants turned out to be a big surprise you can see and taste the really fresh vegetables and other ingredients that you eat clearly not mashed up or covered with sauce the vegetarian foie gras and tofu ice cream are exceptional tonight definitely will come back to try more dishes, the name of the restaurant means fortune harmony and wisdom i think the owner is trying to signify the virtues of their food fu he hui brings us food from nature and transform them into exquisite cuisine
the cooking style is a combination of traditional chinese and modern huate they were technically brilliant and emphasized on presenting the exceptional flavor of its premium ingredients presentation was like zen art pieces and come with lovely complementing cutlery
located in a large colonial building which is transformed to exude pure zen and ancient charm it provides only private room dinning
service was alright but if staff were a little more attentive and practice proper serving etiquette they would certainly earn a 5 stars rating for this review
the restaurant offers only set menus ranging from rmb380 to rmb880 it is a masterfully put together project in less than a year from opening fu he hui made its way to the 19 spot of the asia�s 50 best restaurants list my experience with the food was exceptional","Healthy",0.999696474644324
15,"great food good ambience extremely warm and friendly service delicious food for the quantity and experience its total value for money, the staff were very patient as we did not speak chinese and they did not speak english they finally found the one person who spoke a little english and we were good to go they have a variety of broths and can accommodate up to four different broths at one table then there are a variety of meats and vegetables as well as other addons theres also a selfservice station that allows one to get other spicesflavorings for the cooked meats and vegetables the atmosphere was relaxed and the happy groups of people enjoying a meal together all added to a very nice dining experience not to mention the food was delicious, we decided to come to haidilao for hot pot it was our first time and were a bit lost our server li ying ying was so caring and sweet she helped us with everything even how to cook our food a great experience that lives true to past tripadvisor reviews xie xie li ying ying , this restaurant was absolutely incredible the amazing food and incredible service was on a new level compared to any of the restaurants i have visited in shanghai
we had a fantastic meal between three of us for a great price too of 120 pp
check this place out, arrived at shanghai too early and proceeded to hdl as it is famous in singapore
crowd in the early hours are filled with people who are there after their partying session so may turn a little rowdy

overall service was great but the soup and ingredients are not as good as those that you can find in singapore

they do have more interesting variety

would recommend families to perhaps avoid going there during wee hours in the morning, if you like hotpot go to this place there is a huge selection of sauces and broths as well as quality ingredients the staffservice is also amazing, this is a chain from taiwan so the quality and service is consistent so are the lines during peak times so go a little early or very late to avoid the lines if that is not possible enjoy some free snacks a manicure or some board games the wait can be an hour or more but really worth it the staff is the best anywhere in the world for western tastes you can order spicy or non spicy sauces the meat is fresh vegetables seafood tofu fruits are all first class you cook your meal at the table so you know all the ingredients really fabulous you have to go, well worth a visit when in pudong from street level it wasnt clear where the restaurant was but once we exited the lift the 6th floor was a hive of friends and families enjoying this cooking experience we were lucky since we hadnt booked but they found us a table in a short space of time ordering was simple and efficient and our server was guiding us through the menu choices with ease recommending a few personal favourites before we knew it our choice of soups were being boiled and the selection of meats vegetables etc had been delivered to the table ready for cooking our server andy provided aprons to protect our clothes pocket sized plastic bags to place a mobile phone inside under table charging leads were also available to use should you need it which was unbelievable service was very attentive to ensure we knew exact cooking times of the different dishes a great night dinner experience and well worth a visit, hot meat pot is in itself a food experience though not for everyone we had a great feast a little lost in the beginning without knowing what to do with the ingredients after all it was our first time in front of a hot pot the service though came in hand helping us understand the dish meat grisly pieces stomach and others reminded me of nigeria and the brazilian mocoto we loved it ill bet you will, haidialo hot pot is a rarity in china not expensive great service excellent food quality for a foreigner its a hidden delight but for locals its a well known institution open 24 hours and during busy times you can easily wait 90 minutes for a table so ideally have an early brunch or a late lunch then not so many people its absolutely worth the effort, i have been here at least 5 times while visiting shanghai to me hot pot is all about the sauces the selection is extensive and always full and fresh the service is far better than anywhere else i have been the last trip they gave 2 of us vip room no charge which was nice as it was hot and humid and the room had separated ac controlswill definitely go back, one of the best customer service in china with good food free manicure free snack and excellent service a different side of chinese people, this is the 3rd hot pot restaurant we went to in our 17 day trip it was wonderful the food was great the staff was very helpful in ordering the presentation is beautiful like many restaurants this is on an upper floor of a shopping mall once you are inside it feels very nice they have entertainment roaming the floor dont be put off if there is a long wait they are very efficient get the special fried rice it is so delicious, it was the birthday of one of the members in our group and we had a great night the staff at haidilao went above and beyond we had a man come in and spin a noodle not sure how to describe this really but it was almost like throwing pizza dough a parade with lights a traditional mask show and gifts this restaurant is top notch and the staff really goes all out to make sure you have a great time highly recommend, we were a group of people without any idea about chinese but the waitress had a lot of patience and helped us a lot
they have a tablet and you can see the different options for your hot pot that make easier the selection fish seafood pork beef or vegetables there are all the options tell in advance if you like spicy food or not dont forget to order noodles they cut it in front of you
good price around 60 yuans per person drink included, i have been to shanghai many times but to my surprise i have nothing visited this place you will fall in love with the service they provide it is end to end from while you wait to until you leave the restaurant it is a unique dining experience in china from providing massage to cleaning your shoes we read about the business model of this place it is fascinating they treated their staff right unlike many other place no wonder service can be so awesome their food is quite good too, i visited this place for many times and felt very impress by this restaurant the staff was very hard working to serve us eventhough they cannot speak english, delicious clean great service  a must
i just love soup any kind of soup would make me happy as long as it is good and hot this place was recommended to me by one of my local agents out of 7 nights in shanghai i ate there 3 dinners and loved it
one time we tried 11 pm late dinner to avoid the big dinner crowd but it was still full with mostly young crowed the service was amazing although very busy from eyeglass cleaning cloth apron rain cotes toothpicks to go containers they just had it all wet towels giving out before during and after the meal
and the food omg so fresh and tasteful we loved it
no words can explain the great taste so check out my pix 
keep it up your competitors have no chance

i highly recommend this place, had an amazing work dinner here the best was all the fishballs and sauces available be careful to get here before the long waits, this dinner on may first was an experience raw items are chosen we cooked the items in two steaming soups in the middle of the table one soup chilly hot and the other seem like corn soup we add whatever spices to choose from a dinner took us more than two hours as the chinese say first vegetables and fruits second the meats and sea food an the last rice and other carbohydrate foods authentic chinese different from what they serve in the west they say the west follow the singapore cuisine there was no sweet and sour stuff at all, i have been 4 times already and the service is always above and beyond even for american standards the english can be a bit rough but you are there for the food and experience i highly advise making reservations, so the english skills of the staff may be a bit overrated by previous commenters we had a lot of language difficulties with them  but the place is great very friendly a waiter basically stood by us the whole time refilling waters replacing beers helping boil the goods

when you order the boiling soup you can have 12 spicy and 12 medium spicy  but the spicy just boils over into the medium so just pick medium if you cant deal with the heat very hot  but very good would definitely go there again, service was attentive with the goal of creating a wonderful experience unlike most places in china where you must ask multiple times to get something here they ask or bring straight away the food was tasty but not the best ive tasted regardless this is a restaurant that wont disappoint, this was my first experience of hot pot the challenge was figuring out where it was what food was displayed all in chinese and how it worked but thanks to our fabulous waiter who knew a few words of english and helped us through the ordering process we ended up with a fantastic meal loved it and would definitely go back an adventure but one well worth it, haidilao always present good service to their customer and never let people down on the service offered while you are wait to be seated the selection of fruits and titbits for you to fill the waiting time is great the source for the food offered is in great variety and the end result of the dining experience will not let you down, the service at al haidilaos are fantastic the food is awesome the menu has plenty of choice i miss dining there, we were six persons in a chambre separee eating very exciting hot pot
superb service fun entertainment interesting and strange food
a fantastic experience, we waited for almost an hour while waiting i had a massage which was excellent the food is superb the best mala hotpot i had and i have been coming to china 5 times every year loved the services their attentiveness is beyond, i love chinese hot pot but am not an expert easily able to distinguish between very good and great when it comes to the quality of hot pot food while i thought that the beef lamb shrimp and vegetables were as good as any other hot pot i have eaten in china the service at this restaurant sets it far apart from others the servers were very friendly attentive and efficient and the atmosphere was great i would definitely recommend this restaurant for chinese hot pot lovers, this was the funnest experience in a restaurant that weve ever had there was a waiting room with games and snacks manicures massage chairs and photo booth it really made the time go by then finally when we were seated the food was great and the service was amazing it was a really fun time, hai di lao is a ridiculously popular recent transplant from sichuan theyve made a killing by offering nice sleek dining rooms that look much more expensive than they are an extensive bar of ingredients from which to make your dipping sauce and overthetop service  you can have your shoes shined glasses or cell phone cleaned nails done neck massaged etc while you wait for a table and at busy times youll have to wait ingredients themselves are as good as anywhere but its the whole production including a tracksuited young kid twirling noodles like streamers and dropping them in your pot  the gongfu mian  that makes it one of shanghais best choices for hot pot, visited haidilao for dinner while in shanghai and was not disappointed service is top notch and staffs paid attention to every detail food was really great we tried the ma la soup base and tomato soup base both were delicious quality of food is also consistent pricing wise its super affordable and i paid about half of what i was paying in singapore, hands down this could be my favorite restaurant in the whole wide world could eat here at least 3 times a week oh wait i already did service is the best in the entire city of shanghai the sauces buffet is mouth watering and all the hotpot ingredients are sooooo freaking fresh and yummy sigh now please open a branch in whatever city i live in or move to soon i pray for their world domination, i always go haidilao on friday or saturdays night so its always really crowded however i love that they are so creative in keeping the customers waiting with a happy face haidilao provides manicure massage food and drinks also u can make paper cranes 1 crane = 05 yuan discount the wait is never boring here thats why i keep coming back also the service is always very impressive even comparing with global standard

however i think the food is not that great i actually like laowang better in terms of food but every time i come here i know i dont come for food but for experience

tips make sure u get the queue from the mobile appwebsite before u go to minimize waiting time can call the restaurant to ask whats the appwebsite name i alr forgot, a very social way to have a meal together by hot pot if you have not tried before take the chance to do it

haidilao isnt very crowded so go there early to avoid queuing go there before 18 pm if you need to que dont worry the restaurant will provide you with snacks drinks massage manicure board games so you can kill one to two hours without problem for younger kids there are also a playroom

remember to order the kungfu noddle the guy will dance or having some kungfu with the noddles in front of you i like the tomato soup base and one spicy soup base, my wife and i ate at haidilao a couple of nights ago and had the best time we dont speak chinese but it didnt matter our waitress worked extra hard to make sure it was a great night everyone there makes sure you feel welcomed and they all seem to genuinely enjoy their job
it was our first trip to a hot pot restaurant so we didnt know exactly what to do our waitress spent extra time showing us how everything worked and even cooked some of our food for us so we could see how to do it
the food was fantastic and there were so many different choices to pick from we love spicy food and the spicy hot pot was amazing
i highly recommend haidiloa if you want great food a fun time and friendly service this is the place to go, everything top class high quality ingredients huge choice of food super professional and helpful staff the best hot pot i ever had in china, 24 hours hotpot restaurant and a few branches in shanghai city service good  food tasty and fresh make reservation before go during dinner time
a bit pricey, quality of the service is just stunning so good great experience of chinese cuisine and culture very important was making reservations as there is long queue all the time, a fantastic experience from the start to the finish make sure you call ahead for a reservation we had booked and were lucky to not be amongst the hordes of people waitingto be seated

the food is amazing the service is very courteous friendly with great attention to details

but make sure that you do not order the very spicy broth as the spice levels are pretty high

and the meal cost too is extremely reasonable

waiting to go there again, omg what a place been to a number of hot pot restaurants in asia but none like this
typical hotpot setup you select your 2 broths to cook food in and then select your meats fish and veg however here its all done via ipads
the food was excellent and there is a self service bar for your dips but that is not all
at certain times around the restaurant music cam on and the waiters and waitresses would dance a set routine and have guests join in
make sure you order noodles because the guy arrives in a track suit and does a dance to stretch the noddles
then there is a dancer who changes his mask face at such a fast speed its amazing
if that was not enough there is a free nail bar for ladies shoe shining for gents printer to print your picture and table tennis and pool tables
incredible night, very good and professional service the place was packed and we had to wait for almost an hour loved the tomato hot pot try the beef balls, i got a good impression for all of staff s kindness a little difficult to order for foreign people at the first visiting bubut they, the service is nice although the english of the personal was quite poor but they really try to explain you how hotpot works and what ingredients you can choose the food is general was good and the price was fair, i was lucky a friend had time to wait in the queue when i arrived the waiting time was 10 min to go i like the high service and friendliness level of the restaurant i love the tomato soup and all the hotpot ingredients my friend thought i need a new challenge and ordered pig brains ok not think too much just try and it was not bad after it was boiled in the tomato soup and ready to eat it tasted very soft a little bit similar to tofu if you like a try go for it it is not bad up to the next challenge  drink food quality very good keep on going this way, despite a really long wait almost an hour we left with a pleasant feeling about the food and the service

service is excellent very professional and friendly from every staff we were impressed with our waiter he made an effort to speak english with us and his english was surprisingly good he and his colleague were very attentive and polite

food was good fresh similar to some other hotpot places that we have been to but the service here really makes a difference i definitely recommend this restaurant, this restaurant treats customer very well especially when waiting for a table they offer manicure  free tidbits to keep you occupied while waiting for a table  however i rate food here just average, love how they assign a server dedicated to only 2 tables so you get their undivided attention the beef slices are the best of the sliced meats the pissing beef balls are fantastic provided you do not bite into it and scald yourself or squirt onto your friends these are the must order when at hai di lao
the entertainment provided here at the shanghai hai di lao was fantastic too love the face changing master, we have been taken there by our chinese teacher its great
its always full of people and the waitresses dont speak much english however if you are not too many people you can wait it wont take too long and you are served free fruits and delicious popcorn you can choose the food on a tablet and the prices are really fair the food is tasty and the sichuan hotpot is super mega spicy we really love it, if you are visiting shanghai for the first time it is a must try you must book a table and go with a chinese friend or colleague they dont speak english and honestly i have been to this place 10 times but have never seen a menu in english but if you make an effort to find a chinese companion you will love this place it is not the traditional way the westerners are used to eat chinese food you will be seated at a table with a big pot in front of you you will order your broth and raw ingredients everything from veggies to fish balls meat and noodles you will throw everything in the pot and pick it up with a spoon whenever you feel it is ready you can also eat the food with any of 20 sauces offered the service is fantastic it is fast and professional you will get an red apron elastic for your hair plastic bag for your phone etc so although the table will be messy you will be fine avoid going there at lunch as your clothes will absorb all the steam  so no after you enjoy your fun experience you wont smell good  and dont forget to ask for the show of noodle guy and to try it yourself","Chinese cuisine",0.99984968241496
152,"a typical chinese local eatery old and not so clean there are a lot more modern and will run restaurants around i will skip this one, one of the best local chinese restaurant at nanjing street  food are delicious and big portion with reasonable price but get prepare for long q during lunch and dinner time, very popular with shanghainese as well as tourists either visit before or in between peak meal hours to avoid waiting in long queue the takeout counter next to the entrance is equally busy do try the meat mooncake qingtuan especially popular preqingming or tomb sweeping festival and other yummy local delicacies shen dachengs liangmianhuang is one of the best in town a choice of meat or prawn topping feels like eating south east asias mamee snack with meatprawn topping in sauce slightly in the sweet side worth a try nevertheless, restaurant has two levels level one for noodles and quick bites and a pastry window for takeaway level two for full restaurant i went for level two for dinner airconditioned and nonsmoking environment the quality of the food is good and the price is reasonable offers shanghainese dishes and some safer options that are closer to cantonese styles it can get quite busy during meal times, very prominent right in the middle between east  west intersection of nanjing padestrian street menu still contains many authentic old shanghai cuisine i wouldnt say is par excellence but is the place you would not want to miss if you are around here in nanjing padestrian street, we came here twice over the course of a few days specifically for the xiao long bao dont expect to have a quiet evening experience here but also dont expect to pay a lot either quite busy but still lacking in westerners despite reasonable proximity to nanjing rd and the bund there was a roughly translated menu but it also had pictures so you can point and choose, a couple of days after weve arrived with a friend to shanghai i met up with my dad in the city and he recommended us to visit this restaurant at first we were very unsure about the quality of the food but after ordering we were pleasantly surprised

the food is excellent and it cant be any cheaper a bowl of noodles with meat around 15 rmb spicy meat over rice around 25rmb etc cooks and servers were fast as you would get your food under five minutes

it is important to understand that this is a very local restaurant where usually you will find people rushing in and rushing out sitting on the same table that youre in this is normal in china asking you to pay even before you finish your food noisy environment etc so dont go pretending to find western food a fancy or quiet place

we honestly came back every single day for breakfast and sometimes even for lunch and dinner

it is perfectly located in the middle of nanjing road pedestrian street so you will have no trouble finding this excellent eatery, wide array of dishes go upstairs for the full menu only noodles are served on the ground floor

note that the locals have their meals early 11+ for lunch and 5+ for dinner so go at 12+1 to avoid the crowd and by 830pm they will be taking the last orders

compared to singapore this is definitely not expensive the crab dish we had was rmb140 probably a third of what we pay at home braised pork and fish dishes are about 50rmb


ambience is pretty good  clean smokefree restaurant godsend with efficient but unsmiling service the ubiquitous yang zhou fried rice tasted better elsewhere though so this was a disappointment

in my 2 weeks in shanghai i patronized it 3 times just to sniff out the different dishes

its apparently a <u+8001><u+5b57><u+53f7> so its worth checking out, there are many noodle shops and stalls all over shanghai most are noodles from all over china shen dacheng is a rare authentic 100 shanghai noodle shop serving their signature beef noodle the soup is a richly flavoured beef stock yet it is not overwhelming very much like consomme

shen dachengs xiao long dumpling is a must try although the skin is a little too thick the filling has generous portion of crab added with the minced pork","Turkish cuisine",0.838068955389083
153,"you might need to walk through some seemingly dodgy streets to find the lovely street light  salt is located on but once here you wont be disappointed i visited in winter so i stayed indoors however their balcony views are great the venue is decorated with frenchwestern hipster charm and the good is tasty, i went there for brunch couples of months ago with a friend and we really like it food is good and well presented staff very professional beautiful view thanks to the terrasse a very nice place to try in shanghai, a couple dinner  simply perfect service always present and delicious waitress mussels perfect vellutosa of lobster delicious  then lamb and scallops  me and my girlfriend we had a beautiful night, visited here a for dinner two years later mostly due to the fact that several choices were all full so my first concern was how come they were available it is in a historical building and nice views but it seemed dead and with no life their nicest dining room was closed the staff said and no longer operating our waiter was good but the food was okay but was nothing exceptional and there just was a lack of feeling in the air, i suffered my first bout of food poisoning in shanghai this past sunday when i woke up with mid abdomen pain on early tuesday night i am 98 certain that this establishment was the source of my illness as i did not eat any other food than imported home cooked pasta at home over this past sunday and monday

this experience has just reinforced why i try eat at home imported food and when i do eat out try and find foreign run  foreign kitchen ran establishments

instead of the shanghainese trying their hardest to imitate the west on material things perhaps they can try and imitate standards such as washing one�s hand after using the toilet and before handling food using non tap water to wash salad etc

that being the service of the wait staff was 110, frenchchinese influenced menu fixed menu offers a nice variety of their special duck creme brulee was amazing the duck entree was also impressive i dined here twice in one week and loved the experience each time
service is really spectacular good wine list and great views
on the expensive side but well worth it, of the 9 dishes we had only the pasta with crabmeat and truffles was delicious the others were decent but not memorable and certainly not worth their price service was a bit haphazard  very polite but they forgot to give you a spoon for a soup intimate atmosphere with beautiful rooftop view of pudong so better for a night cap than a meal, well what can i say  get the old chef back

a change of chef can determine the life n death of a restaurant was one of our favourites and we order nearly the same items every visit and its still same good service and wonderful environment but even with similar if not same ingredients and dishes this chef somehow manages to make the entrees bone try dont get me wrong i get dishes not drenched in sauce like a well sous vide of tongue thats high temp treated and tossed with cashews n other nice accompaniments  but not when theres no moisture left in the main ingredient 

the cod  what a great dish it was  but now its a nice piece of fish well cooked and drenched in soy and sugar  the purple potatoes just adds more unnecessary sweetness the vegetable casserole was again drenched in salt  i never order a cup of warm water at a nice restaurant but found my self doing so here

the only saving grace they made a decent steak however we had to insist on medium rare i dont want to think what wouldve happened if we listened to the medium recommendation

get the old chef back, had wanted to go for a long time so finally got around to a visit it was a very wet night and when we arrived we didnt see anywhere to leave dripping brollies and no one offered to take them from us so we carried them right through to a room at the back where they sat us to wait we had gone a bit early to enjoy a relaxing drink at the bar but were told it was not open on the night would have been nice if wed known when we booked the place we were sat was chilly ac a bit too high and pretty dull however when we were taken to our table we were happier but unfortunately the 15 mins before would have had us running to somewhere else if it hadnt been such a terrible wet night
menu was nice a bit different from the norm the staff were friendly and helpful food we ordered was good but it was pretty pricy my cod said it came with purple mash which really was a smear on the plate so with two starters two mains and a side of veg followed by one tea and one coffee we were slightly surprised at the price as we hadnt drank any alcohol we then noticed a 100rmb charge for a bottle of water and 40 and 60 rmb for tea and coffee this did seem a bit excessive and will probably prevent a return visit anytime soon
i cannot fault the food or the service in the restaurant although our initial impression on arrival was not favourable it did improve, we were lucky to choose light  salt to celebrate a special day we went to the one close to the bund it was a little challenge to find the place basically just follow the address and do not try to find the name on the facade of the building  however as soon as we got there we were taken care of with a great care moreover we got a table on the terrace with an amazing view so you can imagine warm shanghai summer night we are alone on the terrace no one is chatting next to you careful service amazing food we enjoyed our dinner so much
i suppose menu is changed quite often what we tried as a main course we chose duck breast and pork ribs those were sooo good for a dessert i would recommend a goat cheese pudding  amazingly tasty, tried a 3 course menu and they for filled my expectations
duck breast with pear as a starter steak as main course on a fresh salad and a raspberry dessert high flavors they served the steak medium rare as i wanted and even the wines were good nice ambiance and friendly relaxed service with good english spoken staff
a bit tricky to find but i will definitely come back, was on my own but got a table outdoors which has a great view of the bund the house special  pasta was done perfectly, met with some friends for a great dinner and one of them that spends a lot of time in shanghai recommended we visit this restaurant it was certainly a good pickthis french restaurant which is only a short walk from the hustle  bustle of the bund provided an intimate and very relaxing atmosphere and offered great views as well this upscale restaurant provided a very nice dining experience from beginning to end the service was very good and each course of our meal was very enjoyable we enjoyed the views during dinner and after we went out on the balcony to really enjoy the views the photos posted with this review are from that balcony theres quite a light show as some of the buildings in the distance are all lit up at night after dinner we took a short walk to the bund to enjoy the views there as well if youre looking for a nice upscale french dinner while in shanghai be sure to make a reservation here, i enjoyed dinner here with some colleagues after a series of meetings the restaurant is just off the bund with some interesting shops and other eateries nearby when we were there they were actually shooting a movie in the street in front of the restaurant the restaurant is not very large which makes for a more intimate and enjoyable experience the service was excellent and the food was tasty we were celebrating two birthdays and the staff was wonderful about providing desserts the desserts were top notchhad i known they were so good i would have foregone dinner and concentrated on dessert i would definitely recommend, to start off this restaurant has the most incredible view of the bund with a spot of difference the beautiful park in front i could have sat there all day looking out
we were with a group of people for the afternoon tea and it was a great choice the afternoon tea is a bit different to what you expect it does not come on the three tier usual setting rather it comes on a single slate plate with a mixture of savoury and sweet dishes i would have preferred more savoury foods but nonetheless it was delicious, not the first time i go there and to be honest the staff are very welcoming  very professional and good english speaking  i think the most difficult for them his the rude attitude of the ladies how comes for afternoon tea   the food his excellent with some work on it amd very tasty  well cook and good presentation  the atmosphere of the place his relaxing  the music his good  perfect for business lunch  friends lunch too  the price are very attractive for be in shanghai  maybe the wine list need to be review  i will recommend it and you i will come back  thanks, my first ever shanghai brunch so dont have any to compare it to but enjoyed it

be sure to order more than one dish as they are little more than tapas size plates

i had fried chicken and crab cake with avocado smoothie cant complain about any of them, we had a fantastic night at light  salt all three courses were really delicious great and reasonably priced wines and very attentive service, if you want a more western type of dinner but still a bit different this is a good place to go to inspired by the 1920s they try to take risks and do different things with the food we had some really good starters and main courses note though the dishes arent giant in size so qaulity and service excellent, i took my husband to light and salt for a romantic valentines day dinner the tables were so tightly positioned next to each other that it was impossible to ignore the people sitting right next to us to our left and our right there were various chinese couples and friends sitting on their iphones not speaking not interacting just looking down at their iphones bored we were encouraged by all of the awards and praise that we thought we were in for a real culinary treat the service was okay we waited a long time for our meal i splurged and ordered a cocktail it was described as something that sounded like a pina colada somehow i missed the fact that it was served in an actual coconut i felt ridiculous hefting this hallowed out bowling ball sized container with a straw if i had known that it would come out like that i never would have ordered it i usually order 2 appetizers finding that the main course is too much food well my second appetizer was the scallops dish when it arrived we had to actually search for the scallops three scallops of various colors red black and greenish appeared an oversized plate they were surrounded by flowers and inky black squid sauce brushed onto the dish it was beautiful worthy of framing as i was eating my edible arrangement i was wishing we had gone somewhere else i left hungry and broke over priced and too pretentious, light and salt is a restaurant that deserves to be known i am delighted to have gone there the welcome is worthy of the best the decor of the restaurant is very nice comfortable very tasteful subdued lighting romantic insured with a beautiful views on the bund as well for summer there is a beautiful terrace with view on the bund the very professional and attentive service flawless and very discreet us were enjoying more rich and refined cuisine with a selection of very good ingredients cooked with passion and details the homage butter is awesome everything was delicious inventive very well presented i loved the black cod and lamb desserts are also delicious there is also an area very interesting library and a chic and cozy bar where you can enjoy delicious cocktails or finish your bottle of wine excelent concept i highly recommend it thank you to the whole team, great food lovely room

then followed by a drink in the attaching nightclub where we had a lot of fun

very welcoming and high standard in every way  a very positive evening in shanghai, deligthful dishes 
i heard the chef has changed thats the reason why i came to taste the new menu
the food is definitely better than beforegreat moments with my wife 
i wiil come backfor sure, i came first to this lovely restaurant mid november for lunch with a group of girl friends i liked the place the set lunch menu was great and a good value for the great quality of the food i liked it so much i decided to come back in the evening with my husband to celebrate a special occasion my husband liked this great restaurant too he took the rack of lamb and complimented the chefabout how nice and refine it was the pan fried seabass was delicious and the desserts really tasty fine dining in a cosy atmosphere and with a great service we will come back for the week end brunch, i heard this restaurant has nice ambience and a good view so i came here for a team dinner with my staff

we were given a private room for our crowd size of 25 so i didnt quite experience the ambience i was expecting as we were in the room all the time looking out of the windows the view of the bund was quite nice

the food was alright but i wouldnt say it was amazing food presentation was mediocre i think i only like the dessert, my wife and i visited light  salt back in september we started out with a premeal drink in the cocktail bar the drinks were well made service was efficient and our server was welcoming and knowledgeable the cocktails were 1st class and an indication of the meal to come our meal was served on the outside patio the setting a block off the bund complemented the meal and provided a enjoyable alternative to the inside of yet another restaurant service was efficient and professional the food was well presented what we really liked about this place is that it felt special the food was different enough to be interesting without being too far out there and the price including wine did not break the bank all in all a great location good food wonderful service and a fond memory of an enjoyable evening in shanghai i would absolutely recommend light  salt and will return if the opportunity arises, had a very cocktail in the library  try the vodka martini  leave it to his imagination and you get a citrus nose and a wonderful kick
moved to the mei ling room  most tables have a view  we were centre stage menu is fresh short so you know its all freshly prepared   and enticing
dont expect huge portions but do expect great presentation attentive service and attention to detail  eg scallops came with a caviar dressing  bread is freshly baked with a selection of butters most of us went for the lamb rack  very tasty and succulent  mine was a touch rare  could have done with a higher temp oven to toast the fat but the others were happy the two who had the miso cod were delighted
wines are available by the glass we had a bottle and not overpriced for the quality beer selection is good
desserts were so tempting i wanted 2
we finished on the terrace in november but wraps were available and the visibility very clear
from the attention in the library through to the warmth on the terrace we were really well looked after  part of the attraction of this place is it is not too large so booking is a must but the attention is great engage with the team and they will respond
enjoy  simon, this had been recommended by friends and we were delighted with ambience welcome cocktails and excellent cod miso pitt and all his team made us all welcome and even though it was mid november we had our deserts and coffees outside on the dreamy terrace with another stunning view  one of the best the world has to offer we love shanghai and we really enjoyed light  salt and will be back , warm peanut butter chocolate cronut hot cappuccino and a view of the bund during autumn in shanghai perfect weather couples with good brunchtea options at light  salt ill recommend getting reservations way in advance alfreso dining space are limited  about 6 tables, high quality food and great environment we had great waguy steak perfectly cooked and coquilles saint jacques i recommend for couple or business lunchs, i wet back to try out the fois gras burger for lunch but was told that they didnt do any a la carte for lunch any more couldnt really get an answer as to why they had the lunch a la carte menu still but we were not able to order from it seems very strange and i was so dissapointed that i left the restaurant, by myself this time my wife and i were here in january food gras starter was great a nice twist pork ribs were good chocolate souffle so light  it looked huge but was so light a couple of drinks in the bar afterwards was the end to a nice evening staff were so helpful as to put me in a taxi to my hotel, we went for lunch and had their 3 course lunch set it was really delicious we sat out on their balcony with a view to the bund it was very peaceful and quiet had a look at the a la carte menu  and will have to come back to try their foie gras burger, my wife and i went for dinner last night and we had a lovely time service was warm and efficient and yet we did not feel rushed unfortunately it was raining and we could not go out to the terrace but it should be lovely during autumn and spring

the breads were delicious and i especially liked the one with the the nuts while my wife had the chocolate bun the cold cuts platter comprised chicken liver pate and ham hock terrine with pickles and olives my wife had the scallops which she said were fresh and delicious while i had the bbq ox tongue which was flavourful and really tender  i would highly recommend this the hunan sauce was not as spicy as expected

our mains were smoked shortribs with tomato salsa this was also very tasty and portions were good it was funny though that some portions were very tender while others were less so anyway we both liked it and polished it off the mintbasil sauce was just okay though

dessert was lavender and lemon rice pudding  while nice we did not really like the pudding as it was rather heavy and a little on the bland side

overall we had a great meal and would highly recommend this place the two complimentary glasses of sparking wine also helped to create a happy mood

there are lovely views of the pudong skyline weather permitting of course and the place can get quite noisy especially when a large group has cocktailsdinner at the big dining area at one side of the long room but its still lovely for a delightful and romantic evening, thank you to all team had a great time for dinner 
great food and service in a very nice atmosphere after drink at the bar was awesome too 
thanks again, went there for a late bite a beer and a friendly chat with a friend dirty unchanged table cloth asked for a beer and they served tsingtao we wanted to choose from not possible no problem
lets get some food french fries received thick potatoes with meat ragout  cheese eventually they served some less thick potatoes soaked in oil
pork ribs tasteless and over salted
fine cheese gruyere spongy baguette kind of stiltonroquefort and a sort of grain mustardall coming directly from city super
platter of charcuterie here is the amazing parti love foie gras the literally stinked old the prosciutto and chorizo was not bad we left pretty much everything on the table nobody asked anything on the way out while in the elevator a good night was heard from the chinese waiter a french manager spent the entire time seated at another guests table and saw us leaving simply careless and rude never again, came here for a friends birthday dinner before a night out on the bund service was good food was great although the set menu thing was a bit confusing since one friend came late and only ordered one item supposedly available only with a 2 or 3 course menu

drinks were on the expensive side but they were well made and werent watered down moved over to the bar after dinner where we were taken care of by andrew kp and carter music put us in a mood to dance but wasnt too loud so you could still talk great space to just chill have a drink and be with friends

will be back for brunch  the lobster eggs benedict looks bomb, great patio for nice weather and air days food is really really good but lunch sets are pretty sparse so better go for a la carte like the lobster benedict and fish dishes  yummy, this is a great new place for a weekend brunch and afternoon tea on the bund

suitable for couples families friends business solo and all other ages and groups whether you are local or traveling

location convenient accessible by line 2 at the nanjing east rd stop located on the rockbund next to the pennisula this is arguably my favorite spot in all of shanghai it is located on the bund a signature place to show your friends from out of shanghai but it also avoids the tackiness of being too touristy as it is in the more upscale quiet north end of the strip

environment unbeatable the interior is very modern with a hint of nostalgia so that you feel like you are somewhere fancy but also feels homey this is a great combination as most brunch spots are either fancy but too hollow or down to earth but not upscale enough there are many good spots with environments like this in the french concession area but not so much on the bund in the summer the patio is also open and you get a view of the pennisula and the former british consulate  as well as a lot of trees and grass almost feels like youre back in europe

food good the quality of the food was actually a surprise to me because i was never impressed by many of the bund spots that claim to be related to michelinstar restaurants the prices are certainly not cheap and the portions are quite small but still a good value deal given the other redeeming qualities i especially recommend the seabass and lobster benedict from the brunch menu

cost brunch and afternoon tea together cost 560 rmb for my friend and i
about 250 pax will get you comfortably full for brunch alone we combined it with afternoon tea which is 160 pax but for two people you only need to order one set because otherwise its just way too much just order a second pot of tea or coffee and share the set which includes both savory foie gras and sweets

service oh wait i almost forgot well its china so you come to expect not too much ask and you will get whatever you need but dont expect anyone to come checking on you every 10 minutes its sort of nice though because for brunch id rather just be left alone and sit for a few hours

overall very happy with this new spot and will certainly come back again, obviously when pitt has no longer working in this property the level of hospitality and service dropped a lot no one is able to do remarkable job likes pitts used to
food dresses well taste in depends i came here over one year not in particular for the food but pitt really makes good job, just returned back from shanghai after a week long trade show entertaining global clients nightly of all the top rated restaurants we visited this was hands down the favorite had had a table for 12 and every dish looked and tasted amazing service from pitt is absolutely first class including helping us all get taxis after our dinner i would recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates fine dining gourmet cuisine presented masterfully in a relaxed but stylish setting with superb and very attentive service well done pitt i look forward to my return visit, read earlier about the place in timeout and was in shanghai wandering around the area decided to go for a drink late afternoon and decided to order a bottle of red had a snack and later the rib from the restaurant menu very good the experience and view from the terrace were simply brilliant dont expect heaven but be pleased with earth, food and service was quite average nothing makes the customer excited in the dining room the cod dish seems a popular item and many people wrote for it but trust me my expectation that not always a good looking or gimmick = tasty and delicious the place wasnt busy at all chefs took a loooong time to send the food out
in fact the bar offers a great selection of cocktail and their barman rick is full of hospitality and strong knowledge of what the guest wants
probably will be back for drinks in the future, food is amazing viewis very nice if you take window seat the manager pitt is very nice friendly and professional his service and wine knowledge is amazing, light and salt is my little secret hideaway serving great food on par with its more celebrated peers on the bund such as m on the bund and jean georges
located on the 6 floor of what used to be the ywca in shanghais roaring past ls serves a delightful western fare with an asian twist i would recommend the 2 different 4 course menu priced at 400+ and 500+ rmb respectively you certainly have an ala carte choice if you rather stick to a lighter meal i love the ambiance with great views of the architecture along the bund on warmer days the balcony area would be a great place for a cocktail
speaking of cocktails at the back of the restaurant is what i call ricks liar officially known as library distillery lounge read my review on it rick has a wonderful eclectic cocktail menu and it is a perfectly good place for a nightcap
sigh i wanted to keep this my little secret but i think it deserves a much higher ranking that what it has now highly recommended, its located on the top floor of the same building of paris rouge we were recommended by chinese colleagues that the brunch is good
great welcoming by the staffs and escorted to a reserved table on the balcony the food was delicious although the eggs were a little overcooked but understood they were very busy and the waitress did a perfect job
the view is spectacular we enjoyed the lucky sunny day there
next time will go there in the afternoon for cigar, fantastic restaurant from bottom to top and everywhere in the middle located in a very cool classic building in the rockbund im not an interiors knowledgeable person but i thought the layout and design was fun and functional

the cocktails are amazing  just wonderful we stuck with the signature cocktails and were not disappointed

the food we had the pork belly salad to start nothing over the moon but a solid dish and very tasty we each ordered a main entree to share back and forth my wife selected the wagyu filet and went with the slow cooked short rib my mouth is watering now as i type this review the short rib was perfect  good choice of meat that was fatty and flavorful but not overly fatty to where you didnt enjoy the meat there was a mashed potato side which went well but not the show stealer the filet was amazingly tender as it should be but cooked perfectly we typically order our steaks mediumrare more times than not in shanghai poor chefs cant get steaks right but to our great surprise this steak was cooked to perfection and paired with potato au gratin we also had the triple cooked chips which were just tasty as can be

we ended the night with the chocolate mousse was came out in a really neat fog the dishes were atop of dry ice bath pouring out the fog so cool

the only negative i have  ls was out of our first 2 selections on wine i couldnt tell if they simply were understocked or if in fact the wines we had chosen were popular that week who knows but the 3rd selection was just fine

great restaurant will be back it is on the pricier end of the scale and definitely a splurge treat  but it is well worth it, amazing venue menu service and wines we held a private client dinner for austen morris associates ama light  salt on march 18th and everything was excellent thank you to the staff who were superb always on hand to offer us whatever we needed there was never an empty glass which was much needed as all the wine were perfectly paired making it very easy to drink our four course menu included canapes and cava in the ls library was a great warmer to the foie gras mushroom bruschetta roasted miso cod and my personal recommendation the slowbraised shortrib on bone which was delicious we will be back with friends and business events again soon, my wife and i had the prefix valentines dinner even though weve lived in shanghai for 20 months the restaurants address took us to a new area near the bund which we had never seen before it was very nice location in bundstyle buildings maybe it was an off river extension of the area we each ordered a different choice from the first two courses and swapped after finishing half of our course we didnt care for the fois gras as it was very fluffy and creamy with almost no pate taste nothing like like the dense buttery delight we had once in france the crawfish soup was really fishy almost a little nasty so we were started off on the wrong foot but then the main course of cod came which we both ordered since it looked much more interesting than the other choices it was amazing maybe the best ive ever had it had a very delicious but not overwhelming soy reduction sauce i think anyway which was just perfect we finished with a really good chocolate dessert the prices were incredibly high i guess over $125 each with a very small but good quality glass of champagne the ultimate measure of a restaurant for me is would i go back and yes i think i might go back but only for that incredible cod the rest wasnt good enough to justify the sky high pricesfor me anyway, nice location above green gardens in old english concession district and heritage road

highly recommend this, this restaurant is in french concession in a beautiful location
it is a place where is good to share the food
we had some tapas at the right price around 5070 rmb the paella for 2 people start from 228 rmb and it is very good
the bill range is around 250 rmb, had a couple of drinks on monday nice place with classic but with that unusual atmosphere escpecially liked windows sangria was fine but martini espresso impressed me much more i like coffee and it was perfect combination starters were tasty so i recommend this place to everyone and def come back to try paella with langostinos and w anything else for 150 rmb next monday cause price is realy attractive, bocado is situated in one of shanghais most beautiful areas the former french concession great place to go for easygoing qualitative tapas dinner for two or more bocado is very suitable for bigger groups and is fun to go to on friday or saturday when the musics volume goes up around 93010pm for dancing and singing songs mostly from the eighties  nineties we went there on a friday evening with a group of 15 ladies and after a wonderful dinner with lovely wines we ended up dancing and drinking delicious cocktails and mocktails at the bar when going with a larger group asking for a set menu is recommendable as its easy and of excellent value for money, bocado is a venue we love going to the spanish menu and drinks are so authentic youd think you traveled to espana the wait staff are bilingual and fully knowledgable about their offerings

meanwhile around 9pm the place transforms into the spot to go for dj music and dancing and hanging out at the bar the expressomartinis are famous

the owner charles cabell originally hails from brazil and is himself very active in partying with the customers  many of whom he befriends

you know its a good place when you continue to go back weve lived in shanghai over 10 years and this is our go to place

strong recommendation, straightforward and yummy spanish with good service in a nice setting and enjoyable ambience excellent service located in a lively street of the french concession, i went to bocado on a friday night with a friend we were about half an hour late for our reservation luckily the restaurant was not too busy that night so it didnt cause us any trouble everyone there was very friendly and helpful i was very pleased with the service we received our server was very prompt that we never had to ask him for anything i was pleasantly surprised when he changed our plates with clean warm ones during the paella
we ordered a cheese board a cold cut meat board a potato dish sorry cant remember what its called a prawn paella and a few glasses of white wine it was a bit too much for two people but i enjoyed every bite
the dining area could have used a bit more light if you ask me i was not a big fan of the flickering candle on the table
we did spend quite a lot more than what we normally would on a friday night casual dinner but id say that it was worth it i would certainly come back to eat again there were so many other intriguing dishes on the menu that i would love to try but i dont think ill come back for another dinner for two id definitely bring more people for bigger parties, i recently made my first visit to bocado here in shanghai and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere really lovely paella wines and cheeses a great ambience for a date or a night out with friends and a in a convenient location
highly recommended for visitors and expats living here, i have decided to write a review after a few visits to this restaurant in different circumstances and always ending up happy i made the choice it is not easy to find consistent quality in this city and bocado is a guarantee

i have visited bocado for dinner with my wife for drinks with friends family dinner and also a business event when we booked the whole restaurant for lunch on a saturday for this review i selected couples because i can only make one selection at a time

atmosphere located in the heart of the former french concession in an area with several other restaurants and bars the restaurant is classy but relaxed with a very warm atmosphere that makes it perfect for a couples dinner you are treated well served diligently and with a smile enjoy nice spanish food and wine and feel relaxed from beginning to end so you can focus on your shared experience

on another occasion we booked a table at the end of the restaurant and we also had a great family dinner the kids really enjoyed the food they did like all of the many different dishes and they were very happy with the upgrade from the traditional family dinner in more comfort foodstyle places the staff were great with them

our business experience was also good the owner was very helpful with the planning making sure everything was to our satisfaction and giving valuable suggestions to ensure our 65pax lunch event would be successful the manager was all over the place during the event and i could sit back and relax when i saw that the staff were easily interacting with the guests and everyone was smiling the menu was good and they even threw in the coffees on the house

lastly try it for drinks on a friday or saturday night after dinner people start arriving for good cocktails that are better value than in many of the bars in the same area you can enjoy your drink at the bar area which i prefer as it gets very lively or sitting at one of the tables

food good spanish food often spanish restaurants in china veer towards the local taste in an effort to attract more clients while understandable this makes them uninteresting if what you are looking for is authentic spanish taste bocado delivers and i would highlight their paellas my favourite is the squid ink one buy i also love their campera with chicken and artichokes they are the real deal oh and their croquettes spanish ham  truffle and mushroom are a must also

service great service not great service for china but great service period the team has been with the owner for many years used to run another very good restaurant in shanghai called mesamanifesto before starting bocado

prices prices are moderate in my opinion very good value for money as i always leave happy

i definitely recommend it, ive been to bocado about 3 times now and the experience is always the same so you wont have any surprises if youre in the mood for spanish cuisine then this is good choice the staff is friendly and helpful if you ask the ambience is nice for a date night or dinner with friends they have a good selection of wine and reasonably priced overall a good experience, at my first visit to bocado i directly felt at home the restaurant has created a homelike but culinary atmosphere it has a warm easy going but also classy and high quality feel and the service is excellent very friendly and helpful good english speaking people welcomed me in, we have been in this restaurant recently and we were delighted about the fine taste of all the dishes and the good spanish wines we were with 6 people and ordered almost half of the menu the cold meat platter iberico ham was terrific but also the taste of the small green and black olives marinated very well and we drank a vina real the last time we did that was many many years ago in spainreally good choice, bocado is located in ffc close to jz jazz club and boxing cat brewery maybe a nice option for a weekend program the spanish food consist out of warm and cold tapas like tjebtypical suspects of octopus galician style nice  ham and mushroom croquettes nice cold cut platter ok or small squids in black ink main dishes are plenty of seafood nice  meat ok and even vegetarian paellas
overall the food is tasty seafood paella was very tasty the tapas are ok a little but more or adjusted price tag would been even great
a second wishno cava on the wine list pls add more
very positive  was the friendly and attentive service smart and helpful a bottle of non chilled white wine was replaced wo we were asking for it great also decoration and atmosphere is nice
so if you want to spend your evening at fuxing lus clubs or bars this spot might give you a nice iberian starting point, recently visited this restaurant for a business dinner meeting and thoroughly enjoyed the food from the get go one thing that stood out was the fast and attentive service which is quite rare in china probably as the waiters were mainly expats food was tasty and arrived fast and hot layout and design of the restaurant is very trendy and in a nice area of shanghai where there are a few bars and clubs very close by maybe another favorite spot in shanghai, grilled octopus warm duck salad inventive cocktails croquettes that melt in your mouth  what more could you want add charming ambiance and good service and you cant beat this french concession gem my local friend recommended it and im glad he did, we met other friends at this establishment for drinks we didnt have any food drinks were cold and staff was attentive to refills bathroom is a bit sketchy as you share with both sexes late night dancing does happen with a lot of group sing alongs to the songs a lot of international people with very few chinese when we were there, we went there with friends as part of the rioja week when we arrived our table was not ready so we where invited for a free drink and a starter for free at a high table once we started our dinner we were quite happy with the food and the pairing wines food was good very good  and service friendlysummary restaurant with nice atmosphere and good spots nearby for a nice cocktail to end the evening, i have been going to bocado since it opened a few years ago the restaurants owner charlie is well known for providing excellent quality food and great service and bocado is no exceptioncharlie used to own another restaurant called messer and manifesto in shanghai and he now owns a restaurant called husk in shanghai which is also highly recommend the food at bocado is prepared by a real spanish chef in addition to the traditional tapas and main courses the menu also include some innovative dishes the aged jamon iberico is as expected excellent the garlic shrimp meatballs argentinian baby squid are all highly recommended the restaurant features no less than 8 paella dishes and each of them is just as good my favorite main course is the pork loin i tried its special roasted suckling pig the other night and it was out of this world come try this place out, you will have fun finding this place but definitely worth it spanish food at its best with great music to keep you entertained dont miss it, its a spanish tapas restaurant in the french concession area they have some amazing tapas and rice balls they�re also sponsoring chi fan for charity go after dinner for an espresso martini and great 80s music, if you are in the mood for a taste of spain then you should head to bocado it is in the french concession of town where almost all the good eatries seem to be but is hidden away on the first floor of a building the interior is low lit with a long bar and plenty of seating organised for small and large groups i was there with a friend of mine and we set off with a selection of tapas spicy octupus calamari tortilla and a selection of croquettes we then shared a chorizo and chicken paella the tapas were excellent the paella was a little on the dry side and possibly overcooked still there was a good choice of dishes and a decent wine list the prices were fair a good place for a fun evening with your partner or to catch up with friends, bocado is on an interesting not over crowded small bar street we were feelingb some late night hunger and gave it try we ordered some tapas and wine service was excellent attentive and friendly the tapas however had a much wider range the black sausage and the iberico ham were standouts the lowlight was by far the patatas bravas the potatoes were either reheated or cooked in oil at too low temperature greasy and soft the bravas sauce was more cumin flavored than aioli the staff gladly took this dish back and did not charge on top of that they brought out a dessert sampler free of charge pricing well it is shanghai overall a very good experience not all was perfect but customer service was as good as it gets in shanghai it feels good to see staff that truly cares about their customers we will return, enjoy the spanish way of eating tapas not every place has manchego cheese iberico ham spanish winesbut this one has nice place friendly staff good for casual dining with friends, my niece made us aware of this big low light upstairs restaurant in the french concession  we ordered many different tapas that filled us up i had a real margarita which was rather good the food is expensive but when you are in need of non chinese food give bocado a chance, the place is casual low light cozy the tapas are good but not authentic taste the music was not that loud and the place was quite empty so it was a bit weird, we ordered quite a few tapas and then a paella to share what was most remarkable was the pace of food coming out of the kitchen very considerate of the small table not rushing us at all just great slow and in a good sequence and yes everything was delicious, somehow all the food tasted very bland and as if the salt was forgotten in all dishes presentation of meals was not appetizing and would definitely not go back especially as there are many other spanish restaurants in shanghai that offer way better food at better prices, the atmosphere is dark and woody the music not too loud the lights not too bright perfect for an evening business supper or to have fun with friends the wait staff is nice and courteous the food was excellent the galician octopus to die for the black paella was delectable
good enough value for the price, very nice ambiance and good friendly service and the best is yet to come the food have eaten here several times now and have always loved everything we ordered the concoctions are innovative and some are just very simple traditional recipes but delicious you have to try this and dont forget to book especially towards or on the weekends, bocado is situated in a road which quickly has become an attraction for locals and expats alike the spanish menu is balanced and quite original for shanghai although some choices like the chicken skewers would benefit from another influence
we tried the croquetas which are smooth and creamy without feeling very heavy portions are small but reasonable for tapas the tortilla was just a bit overcooked to be authentic and the baked ham in tomato sauce had no intensity
the wine list is well priced and extensive we tried the figuero 4 meses roble tempranillo which complemented well our mixed tapas and grilled vegetables the service was attentive without being overwhelming i think an offer of suggestions would probably be helpful for most customers if not for spanish clients the environment is a little bit dark and on a tuesday night was half empty and more or less quiet
overall it is a good option if you missed spanish cuisine or if you are a first timer but azul is probably a better choice overall if you want to eat better and more for about the same price, i have long been a fan of charlie cabells work and indeed was a very regular guest at mesa and manifesto which was a shanghai stalwart for many year

it was with a very heavy heart that learned of its closure and despite the addition of some new eatery and drinkeries in the area julu lu has not been the same since

my life was brightened considerably when charlie called me to tell me of the launch of his new restaurant which to my immense pleasure was located even closer to my house than mesa and manifesto

the food  spanish tapas with a spanish chef in the kitchen which is rare  is just the type of food you would want in this type of restaurant without having to go to the expense of dining at some of shanghais better known

great in an evening when you would like to just have something light  snackie for dinner there is a very broad menu with substantial main courses for those of you with a bigger appetite

to name but a few the croquettas and paella are personal favourties and can be complimented with some european wine which is very competitively priced

the service is always good and there are also a few familiar welcoming faces from the old days

all in all not to be missed, ive been blessed with travel to spain and rejoiced in the great food and atmosphere to find authentic spanish food in shanghai china if you crave something different during your travels this is a very good spot to stop i was convinced as many of the local expats who live in the area and have also traveled to spain attested to the quality and value worth your time to go here, really pretty average food and expensive for the quality you paid for nothing really exciting on the menu too as the restaurant has no pedestrian traffic it is not helping for the business due to the fierce competition in the shanghai market especially with recent tapas places springing up around town faster than you can count we went on a weekday dinner and the place was pretty empty food and service were a little slow too, pros
 nice atmosphere and decor although we definitely could have used a little more lighting while eating we basically couldnt see how the food looked like  and thats never a good sign for me an ambiance more suited for a bar than a restaurant
 warm welcome the owner i think as he was the only spanish there came to say hi and take our orders we never saw him again all night though we were the only table dining there that night so you couldnt miss us
 staff not incredibly helpful but english ok
 location is perfect former french concession among many nice bars and places to continue the night after dinner

cons
 the food menu sounded great all spanish staples with some interesting addiction we decided to share some tapas first and then try two kinds of paella everything tasted bland and average something plain wrong how can you fail patatas bravas
paellas were seriously terrible
either it was a bad night or whoever says this is a great restaurant has clearly never tasted authentic spanish food
all in all it was the kind of quality youd find in say the most touristy cafe on the most touristy spot in spain and youd never choose one of those for a nice dinner would you
 music that was terrible unbearably high volume for a restaurant we couldnt chat or hear each other right and it was a midweek day even a dj was there spinning a cheesy playlist of 80s tunes that really didnt need a dj to be picked if i cannot enjoy the food at least let me have a nice conversation no ok
 price so so expensive for the quality we got

overall a meal that left you with an unpleasant feeling about it with the choice available in shanghai even in the same neighborhood i surely wont be back, set in a loftlike area with wood panel flooring within the french concession the restaurant exudes a warm and friendly welcome the tapas were good and reminded us of our recent trip to barcelona the mains of pork tenderloin were okay though a little sweet while the lamb was cooked well but was a little fatty and chewy the desserts received a mixed review  the chocolate ice cream was excellent with just the right touch of bitterness and sweetness the rice custard was a let down and was just too gooey and sweet service was excellent throughout even though they were rished off their feet possibly due to the crowds from the shanghai restaurant week, bocado offers the most authentic spanish food in shanghai the croquetas and the pulpo are delicious and they have a wonderful wine selection their sangria is out of this world
great atmosphere as well on weekends when it turns into a bar, nice restaurant with good food and a good wine list good variety and flavor, my wife and i went here for a meal on a thursday evening the place was empty at first but it soon filled up

from the moment we entered the service was excellent fast and efficient but at the same time not pushy

we got 6 plates of tapas the portions werent huge but it was excellent quality we also had a dessert each and a beer each in total it was around 550 which is about <u+00a3>55

overall it was great id recommend to anyone and well be going again, bocado is a great place to visit either for drinks or for a meal we really enjoyed the tapas  often drop in there for a drink yongfu lu has a plethora of bars to choose from but if you are after a more ambient  laid back experience this is the place to go service is brilliant  has one of the rare attributes in shanghai  consistency
id highly recommend bocado great food excellent drinks  professional  astute service a gem","steakhouse",0.998398747526996
155,"great burgers and fries this was a nice finding and much needed after a week of chinese food the owner and staff were great really accommodating the menu is limited but worth the stop whether it is for food or just a beer, went there around 6pm on friday night didnt have to wait but place got busy while we were there this location is much smaller then the one on jingan but it seems like they have same amount of waiters haha which makes service much faster paid 230 for 2 excellent burgers and 2 drinks on happy hour highly recommend, went there with my girlfriend last week food was good but what really stood out for us was the excellent service we received from the friendly staff they further have several screens up for sporting events and do great cocktails there it does get quite crowded though so might be a good idea to make a reservation if you go there on the weekend they dont do reservations after 700pm though, went for monday deal when you can get 2 burgers for the price of 1 the queue is really long but i could say it was worth it with less than 100 yuan you can get 2 really good burgers with fries or salad dunno much about beers, went there with family good service good food  nothing crazy but nothing to complain neither over all price acceptable 470 for 2 starters 3 burgers and 3 drinks i give it a 5 because of the service which is good and professional, we were stopping in the area for new years eve  decided to eat here in the evening there was no waiting for a table  the staff were very nice happy hour was from 2pm until 8pm so we had 2 hours of good prices for beer  wine the choice of burgers is good  like others have said they are large  a good portion of fries too we ordered medium rare burgers  they came as asked the only problem was that they were all stone cold no heat at all so we sent them back to be heated up apart from that small hiccup id go back here worth trying if you are in the area, we were downtown on business and lunchtime rolled around and we decided to have lunch our son who lives in shanghai suggested that we go to the hongmei walking street the street is a pedestrian walkway lined with restaurants of all types we were talking about having mexican but my wife had been to the fat cow before and had enjoyed a very nice salad so we changed our plans and went in my wife ordered a burger my son a cheeseburger and i the chicken avocado burger all the sandwiches come with salad or french fries and a soft drink our food arrived in a timely manner the sandwiches are generous and very tasty they arrive on black slate platters as we were eating the place filled up rapidly with a nice mix of chinese and international people the fat cow is a very pleasant place to have a delicious lunch, fat cow is a burger place that caters not only for the meat lovers but also for vegetarians with their veggie burger

there are so many great choices and even though im not vegetarian i do enjoy their veggie burger too you will be spoilt with choices

their milkshakes are really good and they also have a good drinks menu

on mondays they have a two for one burger special so if you need a good burger after a tough monday be sure to try this place their great food and atmosphere will make you forget about the bad day

the only downside about this venue is that it gets full pretty quickly and you might need to stand in line waiting for a table the food will be worth the wait though


ive eaten on many occasions at fat cow and i havent been disappointed once ive also eaten at many burger places in shanghai and ive even reviewed a few bit fat cow surpasses them all

get your cowabanga on, we stumbled across this restaurant while shopping at the pearl market we noticed many westerners eating here we didnt have to wait for a table we ordered the bacon cheese burger and the cowabunga both burgers were good i wish the cowabunga had more caramelized onions considering the size of the burger the onions were very skimpy we would definitely eat here again if we are in the area, probably the best burger in town big and great value for money i have tried every burger in the menu but the best would be the guacowmole and the one with 3 bacon types milkshakes are also great service is friendly and attentive only downside is that it is always crowded on lunch or dinner getting a table can take 30 minutes reserving will be highly recommended except mondays as it is buy 1 get 1, a wonderful hamburgercooked to order so big i had to use a knife and fork to eat it milk shake was the best surprise and the price was reasonable, we loved fat cow amazing food superb service and a nice atmosphere thats suitable for date night but not too stuffy for kids we are visiting for a short time but will definitely go back before we leave our waiter was melvin and he was amazing, not much to say here other than these are the best burgers in shanghai if you are looking for that back home burger this is the place, i prefer this fat cow branch over the other one in laowai street as i like this interiour better and there is no live music which is too loud when you want to talk with friends
food was good not lifechanging the cocktails were okay not as phantastic as others think here the facilities are taken care of but stupidly planned like you better watch out at the mens room to not have water from the sink all over you, stunning restaurant serving massive burgers with thick juicy beef patty cocktails were delicious charming ambiance with quirky menus waiters very good we were served cold water through out our lunch without even asking which is unlike our other experiences great airconditioning which was very welcome with hot humid july weather felt like we were eating in a fancy american diner, big fat pig good burger its a little heavy on the condiments but they do not skimp on the beef and pork if you need a break from the asian food this is it nice pub atmosphere with great upbeat hits playing in a cool climate i will return when i come back to shanghai well done folks, the steaks used to be okay  last time they werent up to scratch the fried chicken is tasty but dry salads and milkshakes are pretty awesome service is usually good, several choices of burgers in different styles good quality and nice environment service can be a little slow good value for money, on july 3rd my wife and i had or were celebrating our 2cd year anniversary so we felt we wanted to do something not so traditional and went out for what i expected to be a great steak and a nice meal we arrived to the restaurant on sunday early evening there were probably about 12 other customers in the restaurant it took several minutes to even get the menu on the table that should have given me the sing it was time to move on to another restaurant but i did not follow my own instincts we stay there big mistake we order two steaks they were out of half of the items on the menuthe selection was limited and when they finally brought us the steaks my spouses was raw not rare but raw needless to say we sent her meal back to be cooked properly in the mean time my food got cold the wine is terrible and the service is the worse i have receive in shanghai i have been here for several years and the walking road has many restaurants be sure i will never stop here again i dont recommend the place to anyone that has any expectationsstay away, went there with a friend from shanghai great experience the burger was great meat done just as i asked onion rings and the vanilla malted shake were great, having heard a lot about fat cow in my quest for a good burger i found myself there for lunch

the decor and the vibe of the place are very laid back and pleasant the puns in the menu are quite humorous as well

i tried their recommended ale and found it to be very good strong and very smooth

i had their classic burger and specifically asked for it to be well done

to my disappointment it came medium and rather than make it fresh they simply redid the same patty bite and all

that aside the burger was quite flavorful and easily the best ive had so far even better than beef  liberty

the fries were slim and tasty

there were a lot of other interesting items on the menu and perhaps another visit is called for, this street of eating establishments offers the chinese and western tourist just about any type of food imaginable we selected fat cow as our american family has been living in china for two years and was longing for a good burger  fries we found the wait staff to be especially friendly and helpful we didnt wait long for our food and only one burger had to be sent back as it was undercooked they made me a new burger and it was perfect each burger comes with a side salad  the orzo pesto was yummy as was the asian blend the side order of fries were crisp and generous in size seating is inside or out on the covered patio we sat outside quite comfy and dry in the light rain there are several other restaurants along this street wed like to try from thai to mexican to french the choices are unlimited a little on the pricey side but great ambiance close walk to longxi metro station, have had fabulous asian food since we arrived have had hot pot sushi dongbei muslim street food  now craving a juicy hamburger cold salad and cheese sticks all found here with a cold coke or margarita best burger ever with australian beef salad trio excellent only down side sever unwilling to customize toppings probably a chef thing, a gang of us met there recently for drinks and burgers it was a great place for us all to catch up and socialise

the staff were excellent and managed to keep good track of the various bills running in our company

the food was slightly hit n miss on the whole the burgers were excellent however one had to be sent back as it hadnt been cooked fully this is however unusual for the place i believe

overall it was good value and we will be back sometime, fat cow located near longxi road metro station a street called laowaijie it means street for foreigners happy hour ends at 8pm its a american restaurant that offers fried chicken fries milk shakes beers steak and especially its hamburger many people said fat cow offers best hamburgers in shanghai and so far yes its the best hamburger that i had in shanghai
i ordered cheese flavor hamburger kinda forget the mane the meet inside is really juicy with rich and delicious cheese the hamburger is too big that two girls can share one milkshakes is also awesome i ordered whisky flavor
there are chinese and foreigner waiters so foreign travelers can be relaxed there the atmosphere is also good not too loud not too quiet, best burgers ever  a huge selection of different varieties
theyre humongous served with a massive bowl of fries delicious 
also a good selection of food on the childrens menu
very reasonable prices too , i stumbled upon this place while trekking around north of jingan temple its a real gem the burgers are fantastic more options than beef and liberty so many different types of burgers to choose from another great thing about this place is the salad options they have some fantastic salads and enough choices to have a different one for at least a week and a half stellar salads fat cow also brews their own beer which was pretty good i would highly recommend going to this place if your in the urge and want something better than munchies or different than gourmet burger or beef  liberty both of which make fine burgers, i met my friend here for dinner my criteria for a good burger is that it is a bit greasy requiring lots of napkins i had an awesome burger the fries were amazing definitely one of the best burgers i have ever had in asia, by far one of the if not the best burger place in shanghai amazing burger amazing salads i would recommend to get a salad instead of chips any day even though the chips are good too and really nice lemonades, we went with the children to this restaurant in the lao wei ji this is a street with many different restaurants someone told us we need to go to fat cow because of the good burgers we went on a friday evening the restaurant was full the burgers were very good fries thin and crispy and the drinks were in happy hour half price, we went here based on a friends recommendation and were very happy with our food the burgers and fries were delicious and reasonably priced if there was one on the pudong side we would make this a regular stop if you like blue frog or bistro burger then you should definitely give this place a try, we really enjoyed the burgers at fat cow thats the specialty and we also liked the caramel chicken very crunchy and just the right amount of sweet and spicy to top it off my malted milkshake was great cool place with a cool vibe, great burgers  cooked to order medium is quite pink but i like it that way medium well is slightly pink the middle and well done is obviously cooked all the way through you can sub a small salad instead of fries or for 5rmb extra you can upgrade to sweet potato fries which are delicious the regular fries are good too
my favorite is the cowcream burger if youre a fan of cheese be warned there are onions on it but theyll leave them off if you are very clear about it when ordering if you like some spicyness the mexicow is a good choice or if you like your food ridiculously hot theres the raging bull not for the fainthearted the avocowdo is also good and there are lots of other options the burgers all have goofy spinoff names and tasty sauces the salads are also quite good another promo is tuesday nights 3 salads for 55rmb so if you want a lighter dinner thats a good option too
if you go on monday night between 510 you can get buy one get one free burgers but be warned its busy the prices are around 90120rbm so youre paying on average $14$18 usd per burger so thats why its so packed on monday nights they run happy hours most night too with discounted drinks the drinks are good their beer fat cow is good and they also have other imports like corona they also have milkshakes pricey but theyre pretty good had one that was off once and another that was quite yummy
its on hongmei lu which is a big expat area you have to go down the restaurant row strip to find it not far from the train lit up in neon green you can see from the road service is pretty good but when its really busy it can take a 3045 minutes to get your food so if its a monday try to order as soon as you get in there
overall definitely worth it its imported australian beef and theyre consistently good we try to stick to promo nights but every now and again we find ourselves feeling its worth it for full price too because its so darn tasty, i went here with a couple of my close friends so i could check out the foreigner street laowai jie and get some much deserved foreign food after living in a more remote city for the last year the service was great and the burgers were just as expected some great beer available on tap as well there werent many people within the restaurant but we showed up at about 2pm so thats to be expected honestly wouldnt go there again as there are so many other western restaurants to check out in shanghai but it was an overall good experience, i took the metro with a friend after work to try fat cow on laowai jie the food was good and the spiked shakes really good and strong but it was just too far out of the way to merit visiting more than once

hongqiao metro 10 mins walk from longxi rd keep your eyes peeled for laowai jie because it is its own little shopping strip fat cow is tucked about halfway down the right side, this restaurant is located in the foreigner street of hongqiao where lots of fun foreign influenced restaurants are lined up
the fat cow is a relaxed restaurant nestled somewhere in the middle of this street
the decor is western and inviting
the waiting staff speaks english and the menu is both hilarious and informative with a very broad range of food items to choose from
vegetarian options are available as well
the food we ordered was out of this world and the house brew went very well with it all
i absolutely loved this place and would recommend it to anyone, i really liked the burger that i ate the food is really good
one point less because we had to wait about 20 min to get a table, if your hanging out for a burger after all that chinese head down to hongmei lu food street and treat yourself to a real burger and fat fries one of the best burgers youll find in shanghai and if your really hungry go for the hot chicken starter as a lead in ill be back for sure as will many of the expats ive taken along, excellent variety of burgers very good quality very friendly  clean nice atmosphere  place full of expats in a nice lively street full of international cuisine restaurants  bars highly recommended for both a night out with friends  a nice meal with family, probably the friendliest and most welcoming of the many restaurants along this stretch called the gathering the staff are genuinely welcoming and helpful something of a rarity in this town i find and then the burger
it was just simply delightful and in spite of it being huge full of flavour and tender and juicy i didnt have the bloated feeling so often with other burgers the fat cow stands out as a place to return, good burgers and the rest was tasting good as well happy hours on mondays buy one get one free waiter was really making sure she got the order correct repeating thorough , i needed a place to go to before i had a tutoring session so i decided to head to the place where all the expats seem to go in shanghai to grab some western food i ended up stumbling upon this place where the salads are small but amazing need to get at least two for yourself but its worth it and the happy hour margaritas are great, great burger joint off hongmei lu when you see the stationary train you know youre in the right spot just head back and youll find it the burgers are tasty theyve got fun names and some funky kinds their medium is rather pink but in a nice juicy way if you like that if you like more cooked through but not well done then make sure to specify mediumwell the salads are quite nice too  youre able to sub a salad instead of fries  i like the nui york salad the cowcream burger is great and meant for cheese lovers my hubby loves the mexicow burger  its quite spicy and flavorful he tried the raging bull and that one is extremely spicy  almost just to be spicy  doused in chili sauce so hed only recommend that if crazy almost painfully spicy is your thing go on monday nights for buy one get one free prices are usually around 85110 yuan so the bogo offer is nice but expect 2030 minutes to get the food cooked fresh and cooked to order, wanted to try the burgers and was pleasantly surprised firstly the wait staff were great very pleasant helpful and had smiles on their faces
the burger with cheddar bacon and bbq sauce was pretty good cooked medium so very tender and quite tasty the cheese was a bit mild but the bbq was lovely
thin french fries were nice
overall very good, we really love burgers and we really love fat cow it has super burgers with all sorts of combinations fresh and delicious burgers i think mine was called the cowvocado burger the place itself is really nice too and super milkshakes, i find this restaurant frustrating  it oscillates between delivering a great meal and a forgettable one

i generally prefer the fat pig burger as it generally delivers aboveaverage in the flavor department paired with one of their grazing salads its one of the best burgers in shanghai

service is again hit and miss sometimes youll find four waiters just hanging around avoiding the customers other times they cant do enough for you, tried this place couple times and can recommend the burgers as they are quite big and meat patties have been good tried also steak but nothing special  recommend sticking to burgers in this place, the environment is very nice to begin with music is great definitely will come back if i crave for burgers or a strawberry smoothie, the best burgers you can have in the laowai jie the pedestrians street in hongmei road service can be slow but the food quality is worth to wait, i am all about the food and fat cow takes some beating i have tried a lot of their burgers and they are all very good my favourite is the fat pig great size portions with lots of fries their sundaes while expensive at just over 60rmb are delicious

on their best days they make unbeatable burgers but they have once undercooked my well done burger and my friends have also had their burger undercooked a few times easier enough to have it recooked but it is a bit annoying if your friends are already eating

i agree with some of the previous reviews that the service could be improved

i personally have not had any problems with the managers and they have been decent when i raised any issues i had

as far as food goes then it has to be 5 stars","Spanish cuisine",0.999674729870864
156,"walked past this bijou restaurant one evening and thought this looked interesting and was pleased to hear the good reviews on ta so we made it a date for a saturday night plenty of foie gras on the menu and my trio was well presented with a wonderful creamy terrine with calvados and more foie gras with the australian filet
��, a very nice cosy and charming place with excellent food french touch delicate and innovative and this restaurant is located a few meters away from nanjing pedestrian road and walking distance from the bund and people square you just need to find the street which is a bit small and dark at night but this is worth a visit everything
��, i love this french restaurant not only for the food and mouthwatering desserts but also for its decor is very clean and cozy perfect to go back for tomorrows special day such as valentines day cant wait to try their special valentines menu with my love one epices  foie gras is the perfect place to celebrate love, it is a place well worth discovering if you are shopping in nanjing lu walk a few min and enjoy the experience nicely decorated room fresh ingredients and tasty recipes friendly staff i personally come back for the fresh lobster with some very good sauvignon blanc and the kids always enjoy a gourmet kids menu and playing area everything at
��, i have visited here now twice have to say i really like the interior and atmosphere food is excellent and price reasonable compared to the quality and extra bonus for french speaking at least part of the staff speaks french warmest recommendation, had an amazing christmas dinner at this restaurant delicious foie gras organic salmon and chocolate mousse not to mention the coziness of their atmosphere and excellent service definitely recommend this for french food lovers in shanghai and for any occasion, if you are foie gras lovers you need to go there it a really nice place elegant and cozy the service is really good and the food it high quality at good price, i have been already a couple of times to this french resto and it is one of my favorites in shanghai for french cuisine if you like the fois gras you should try their tris which is excellent i also had a very good lamb good selection of wines and dont miss the desserts service impeccable, great food nice staff really liked the foie gras magret de canard and carre d agneau it really made us feel at home in france prices are reasonnable for that quality in china, last week was the second time i have visited this restaurant for dinner and both times the meal has not disappointed started with the foie gras from the special list which was nice though their 3 types is amazing and then for main had the lamb which was well presented and cooked to perfection, i was on the bund with friends and we decided to stop by this restaurant during burnch time we tried their brunch set for 218 rmb  for that price we got a lot i couldnt finish it i have to admit i was impressed the brunch included 3 courses i tried foie gras scrambled egg with asparagus since i wanted to try foie gras so bad for the first time as its this restaurants specialty together with food you get to choose also orange juice or coffee of course i needed coffee
their ambiance is very clean and quite, very nice and friendly restaurant owner taking care of all family members great macaroni for children lamb chops so far best in shanghai small negative remark for toilets, finding good restaurant in shanghai is not difficult finding a good steak on the other other hand is not easy this place is good for a romantic night out service is very good wine selection is limited but good ones the place is not big let them know if you have a group more than 6, this is an excellent venue on the bund that is not very well known because its inside an internal street but its excellent i love to have both brnch and lunch here and they have really convenient promotion to be on the bund less than 120rmb for a lunch and less than 220rmb for a brunch its like a miracle in a city so expensive like shanghai the food is very good and tasty and im litterally in love with all their foie gras dishes, exquisite presentation genuine french cuisine flavours impeccable service  and im only talking about the great value for money set menu lunch 88118148 rmb for 1 2 or 3 courses
i had the freshest sea bass with an incredible lemony creamy super light sauce which is one of the most delicious and unexpected things ive eaten recentlythis is haute cuisine but with decent size portions incredible attention to detail on the quality flavours presentation and service and i suspect a passion for things well done no doubt ill be there again to try all the menu, i love to go to epices  foie gras for lunch as this is located not to far from my office the owners are very friendly which barely happens here in shanghai and well be happy to have a nice chat with you food is excellent and affordable which is now a difficult mix to find here in shanghai

definetely recommended , great french food especially if you like foie gras and awesome hosts in a nice setting this place will become famous hurry up, like just said you have to go try it test it enjoy it
services quality food the place to be i wish a very long life to this restaurant in add  for a very nice price
sans hesitation y aller cest lapprecier vous aurez en prime la possibilite dechanger avec le boss en francais, we were twice there in 2015 and i must say this the kind of secret gem in shanghai you struggle to find but are so happy when you finally get it the restaurant is located next to the most buoyant part of nanjing dong lu  but do not get it wrong  it could easily be by style and attitude located somewhere around fergusson lane  this is a real gem of sensual dining and stylish attitude that you barely can find in shanghai  it is the ideal place for the first date with a city routined lady or boy  who thinks shehe knows everything about dining in shanghai  you will impress her him

the restaurant is luxurious in a smart way but not high on blunt show off its delicately furnished in a mid scale elegant urban style you could easily find in paris bobo  districts 11th or 12th arrondissement

they have have a veteran europan chef with excellent experience and have centered their menu around foe gras this unique sensual delicacy that makes so many dishes addictive

regarding the quality of the foie gras goose or duck liver a luxury french product of unique taste i would say  its one of the best in shanghai next to cuivre and mr and mrs bund but better than anyone else in shanghai the overall setup has a nice romantic and stylish attitude that fits with a young urban crowd than wants to less showoff but a nice time with a beloved one or some intimate friends 

the restaurant is on three levels the ground floor is more casual while the upper levels have a little more style and there is a romantic al fresco area service is amazing  really good and caring for the client  you will be delighted my wife was totally charmed we went there twice on one occasion as couple on the other with friends and had great evenings 

highlight
 triology de foie gras  a pure sumptuous but still elegant flash of taste of fried cured and cold preserved foie gras a real excellent and delicious introduction into this great product
 risotto of vegetable mushroms and foie gras  a creamy delicate perfect melt of rice vines foie gras and mushroom  absolute delicate taste
tournedos rossini was really good the grilled steak and the foie gras slice was a perfect harmony layered with a dark truffle sauce  the best i had in shanghai
 as dessert we shared a crumble intense tarte tatin were the caramelized apples lacked a little of acidity but this was the only shortcoming of the evening

perfect really outstanding service  specially on giving some recommendation in the french dominated vine list

this is really a place for a perfect date ","Sichuan cuisine",0.980717830360196
158,"my husband and i ended our twoweek long china honeymoon in shanghai and were desperate to find a familiarfeeling western bar we found ourselves at les cafe des stagiaires after a failed attempt to find a cat cafe in shanghai sadly the one we found was out of business we were able to sit at the small bar and enjoy a few espresso martinis as our afternoon pickmeup as the place started to fill up we looked around and noticed everyone was ordering pizza so we felt compelled to follow suit we ordered a pizza which was delicious and switched over to beer and wine my husband tried a few vedett beers a belgian beer we had never tried before and it was quite delicious we also had their cheese plate and it was one of the better ones ive tried in recent memory i appreciated the fact that little flowershaped pats of butter were included with cheese plate  bread and cheese is amazing but bread and butter is where its at we were there for happy hour so the prices were reasonable the staff was standoffish at first but warmed up to us after my husband initiated conversation with one of the managers overall this cafe is a wonderful familiar and laidback gem in a bustling chaotic and foreign city, this is a very trendy restaurant and bar on a great soi in sathorn staff a friendly and relaxed just a little too relaxed causing service to be incredibly slow at times great choice of cocktails and the various tapas dishes are delicious theres now a french bistro on the top floor as well which looks worth a try nice atmosphere and able to sit outside which makes this a very easy place to have a great night, what an excellent evening we spent at the bar i forgot to count how many cocktails we drank good music friendly staff reasonable prices  a very good spot to visit, love going at le cafe des stagiaires for a couple of drinks any time of the week they also serve good food for lunch  snack  dinner, living near the cafe we were regulars it is definitely the best bar on yongkang lu offering excellent drinks service and atmosphere the happy hour provides great value for money only 20 kuai for a glass of house wine the people are all so friendly and sitting on an outdoor table on a weekend evening defines my time in shanghai would recommend whole heartedly, very helpful staff happy hour interesting menu well worth a visit  nice jazz ambience and quiet enough on a sunday night to relax over a few beverages, to understand le cafe you have to understand yongkang lu

yongkang lu if a big hangout for foreigners located in the middle of a residential area it is a few blocks of street with bars on either side most of them are small and open up onto the street it is a decent place to start a night of drinking if you dont mind more pricey drinks though if you search hard enough you can find some decently priced drinks a decent and at first confusing walk from the metro and having to move indoorsleave around 10 or 11 pm because there are apartments above all the bars it is pretty decent to hang out when the weather is nice but it sucks in the rain

it can get super crowded so finding a seat can be a problem and service can be slow they host some huge crowds on nice weathered holidays i was their for st patricks day and it had a decent turnout

le cafe is one of these many bars it has a decent atmosphere but does not stand out overtly on a street filled with bars except that it is a bit bigger and serves a bit more food

directions take the metro to shaanxi s station lines 1 or you will walk down shaanxi then turn right and cross over the road and continue down fuxing from there you will turn left down jiashan and walk down the street until you see yongkang lu on your right cross the street and enter yongkang about halfway down the street on the right is le cafe is at the far end of the street

hoping a taxi is always an easy option, these three frenchies have created a lively contemporary and authentic frenchstyle cafe bar at the heart of yongkang lu  a great way to relax with friends after work chatting over a vedette and listening to a good music playlist, cozy shop having happy hour even in the weekend afternoon good price and nice place to stay and spend time with friends, the yongkang lu branch used to be my favorite i like its music mix the quaint interior decor the faint light around corner table drinks are ok for a beer enthusiast like me but this is not a beer pub so i give it a pass what i could not tolerate is its deteriorating service
one of the bartender never smiles to customers his stern look almost becomes css logo now the arrogance and temper grows with its fame and popularity on sep 20 sunday my friend and i were just sitting at the corner and having a nice chat over a cup of beer at 1230am the waiters and bartender already grow impatient with us sitting there they asked us to leave so they can clean up shocked never see in states bartenders kicking people out while guest still have little beer in their hands but i am still polite enough to reply please let me finish this beer i will speed up then the sternlooking bartender approached me with great impatience hurry up and leave we need to clean up i think this will be the last word i would ever hear again in cs unless they ramp up their service quality i wouldnt recommend this place any longer, excellent spot for beers got a good range featuring vedett and la chouffe etc cool hangout with friends does decent bar food too, looking for nice bar and area to chill n drink this is the place must visit while in shanghai from here u can head to xintandi area, le cafe des stagiaires was started with 3 students on an exchange program a few years ago and their first attempt at creating something turned out to be a very successful one if you miss that eastern paris feel drop by for a beer or some finger foods fairly laidback it has this french thing where you spend most of your time people watching while having your drinks on the sidewalk table a place to see and to be seen in the expat crowd, situated in yongkan road one of the better bars where you can have a good drink in western environment, nice atmosphere and really warm staffi like to spend time here and recommend to visit this typical and charming district with a stop to this bar, the food was acceptable nothing really special but taste ok nice vibe and decoration felt like french tradition service a big problem staffs are neither attentive nor friendly we waited for quite long even a glass of red wine
suggest the owner should focus more training and hiring enough wait staffs to look after the guest well i will come back another time at least i like the place very much, sandwiches and wine with friendswe had the chicken sandwich and the parma ham sandwichvery good you can also eat outside that is very good during summer, yongkang road has many different bars and cafes it is one of the best if not the best one they also have other two locations in the city dagu road and wuding road for a drink this place is perfect its easy and chill the drinks are nice the service is fast they serve authentic alcohol at least i think so  many places in shanghai cheat and give you chinese alcohol that was poured in nice bottles of the brands you recognize they close around 2am really nice cool place to hang out especially when the weather is good for the food not my type of a place but definitely recommended for drinks, this cafe is my favorite place in shanghai the perfect spot to hang out and chill with friends or a good book i was also impressed by the story of the cafe really cool and well done the beers are nice and the food great really worth a visit, nice place to stop by for a beer or glass of wine good location on yongkang lu  a young crowd
enjoyable will go again, a bar located in the yongkang road which means you can expect to have all the young expats hippies and good looking people around other than that they do have good section of draft beer on tap from france and belgium
the price is very affordable and met some nice people there before having a good chat

just chill and relax to enjoy the atmosphere btw it�s a good start for bar hooping or just sitting there, cant go wrong here this place appeals to a casual laid back mixed crowd perfect for after work drinks good happy hour  food choices its busy with people on the street but the bar staff are helpful and friendly an easy option for all reallynot a classy joint but its got charm, we saw this joint always being crowded in the past and decided to have brunch on a sunday in their terrace the staff were very friendly and attentive and the breakfast was nice omelette baguette croissants etc all that a good breakfast requires fresh and plenty price ok too especially in case of good air and nice weather a good choice for brunch which they could start a bit earlier though starts 12pm , located on busy tong lang road french bar not bad drinks for given price good service and place to hang out, i loved this bar placed on the french neighbouhood it has a very nice decoration and there was a great atmosphere with a lot of expats hanging out there we came for drinks and had great belgium beers and some good sandwiches value is very good and staff is absolutely lovely, i stopped here with my wife and sister on open sunday to have a drink and relax by the time we had arrived we also found ourselves hungry thinking this was simply a bar street we sey our expectations low we were expecting china coffee shop food we ordered a ham and cheese croque monsiuer salad with chicken andca parma ham sandwhich we were all pleasantly surprised the greens and veggies on the salad were very fresh the sandwhiches were both tasty with fresh ingredients we had some wine by the glass and my wife was very happy to find her favorite belgian fruit beer there is a decent selection of wine by the glass and they seem to turn bottles quickly as taste was good the atmoshphere is worn chic and comfortable service was good were not kept waiting to order refills were timely and orders delivered accurately i would hesitate to return, we come here once a month to have a glass of wine and meet with friends nice atmosphere good service there are a dozen more bars at yongkang road but this one is almost always packed, i did not eat here but the choices looked good for me it was a very nice place to have a good belgian beer in the afternoon after a lot of walking around the french concession the entire street is lined with bars but this is the only one i visited i found this place on tripadvisor before i arrived in shanghai and it was every bit as good as i hoped it would be, small bar and coffee shop affordable prices good atmosphere very busy in the evenings like the rest of the street, i invited around 30 ppl to celebrate bday here at happy hour which is 5pm8pm la chouffe and liefmans from the tap were really good definitely a recommendation i also tried pastis which was really weird but worth a try we stayed for nearly 4 hrs it was a blast
the salads and croquemonsieur were delicious as well indeed the whole place is very french and always full of frenchies ppl love to come for brunch especially on weekends, if youre looking for somewhere to relax with a glass of wine and a sexy cheese board look no further

i was a regular visitor with my friends last summer and am looking forward to returning during easter to sample their delights once more

other highlights are the courteous staff gorgeous fresh pastries and convenient location if youre looking for a night out on the town id recommend stopping off here for the house wine or fruity beersciders, always a good time there its cozy and friendly they have nice beer for cheap price and the food is very convenient, une bonne ambiance francaise a lautre bout du monde  very nice and cheap  somewhere to go after work  really nice team and good pizzas, i have visited this cute bar in the french district a few times already its a great place to get brunch on weekdays and drinks on the weekends there is a wide variety of belgian beers and live music some nights which makes it a great place to hang out with friends the menu is standard nothing innovative but still food is good i would recommend the cheese plate is good quality for great value worth a visit, we had beenhere last week during shanghai trip and found this place on trip advisor for two people having salmon three egg benedict  delicous sauteed mushroom with three kind of cheese just 170 chinese moneyoh perfect pls drop by here and enjoy with yourbrunch, there are four different stags in shanghai i think and this is the one on dagu lu the interior looks amazing at this place the selection of drinks is great the staff are great too they have live music some nights of the week definitely recommend, i love this place definetely not to eat but best to go for some drinks it<u+00b4>s always crowded lots of expats there<u+00b4>s a lot of other options to go nearby drinks are cheap, <u+901a><u+8fc7><u+670b><u+53cb><u+7684><u+63a8><u+8350><u+6765><u+4e86><u+8fd9><u+5bb6><u+9910><u+5385><u+8fd9><u+7684><u+5403><u+7684><u+4e5f><u+5f88><u+70c2>10<u+70b9><u+6211><u+4eec><u+8981><u+4e86><u+74f6><u+6c34><u+4f46><u+88ab><u+544a><u+77e5><u+9700><u+8981><u+5728><u+91cc><u+9762><u+5750><u+800c><u+4e14><u+662f><u+6ca1><u+88ab><u+544a><u+77e5><u+7684><u+60c5><u+51b5><u+4e0b><u+591f><u+4e86><u+4ee5><u+540e><u+4e0d><u+4f1a><u+5728><u+6765><u+8fd9><u+91cc><u+4e86><u+3002>do not order bottle wine around 10 they let you sit outside very bad management, i came here with friends as i heard a lot of good things about it it was not disappointing it has a large variety of beer try the liefmans fruitesse if you like sweet beers it is amazing

i recommend this place mainly for foreigners as there is a big international community will be back during my next visit to shanghai, great bar located in the heart of the former french concession had a nice lively ambiance and the variety of belgian beers on offer was impressive great place to grab a drink with friends and mingle, always very crowded it is one of the best place to hang out and take a beer with friends and meeting new people the beer is good as the company, i still remember the first time i went there with my french supplier as a shanghainess its easlier than my thought to join the french group she is quite right to know my taste and very good choice later when i have time i always prefer to go ther to have a cup of mojito or liit, le cafe des stagiaires is one of the best locations in shanghai to grab a drink and meet up for happy hour on the happening street of yong kang lu there is always a large concentration of hip french hanging around this bar the bar offers excellent service because it acts as a hospitality internship for students very cool place  i hope to go again this weekend, the beer is reasonably priced the crowd is great mainly french the food is not my favorite though, chill music great drinks but most of all a fantastic atmosphere cs is definitely he standout in yongkang lu and the mostly french interns that man the different bars of cs are some of the greatest and wildest people of the city, sure it gather mostly the french community but with any comparison the cafe des stagiaires 1 2 and 3 is the best place to chill out have a drink with friends and meet people
with a special coup de coeur for the one in yongkang, have a drink and relax from your everyday hustle living in shanghai or simply enjoy taking a break from visiting this vibrant city either way you will feel welcome and taken care of at this place a melting pot of the asian and european culture whether it is the ambiance the food or the people you meet there i will definitely pass by next time around, ive been to the yongkang road and jiaozhou road branches and love it nice relaxed atmosphere with beautiful people all around , great place to meet before going out there is a very lively atmosphere and a good mixture of people from all over the place, very trendy afterwork summer evenings at cs1 were always great great mood great staff a must","Sichuan cuisine",0.976449798528691
159,"i went for the first time last friday night nice location and warm decor the staff is really attentive and helpful food is well priced and so is the wine list simple food actually but light even the goat cheese suffle was light chicken is tender and juice i will go back, nice location lovely decor staff speaks superb english large menu that ranges from pricy to take out a second mortgage

we sat down and were immediately assaulted by bad music played loudly so loudly that i could not hear mrs narsfweasels speak normally that would be cause for giving the restaurant extra stars but i made a promise to listen to her more so we asked them to turn the music down and they did then they turned it up again when we asked a second time we got an absolutely filthy look they turned it down but we had clearly worn out our welsome

the english breakfaststyle bacon and beans was too bland to merit the 100rmb+ price tag but the juices were good anemic steak tartare was another disappointment

this really does seem like the kind of place you go to when you have too much money which is thankfully an afflication i have rarely suffered from, an old house in the border of the french concession restaurant is on 3 floor their grilled chicken is excellent avoid the pic hours as this place is known and can be crowdy one of my prefered place in shanghai, we live in shanghai and planned a family dinner last night with daughter who is back in town from boarding school

choose mrwillis one of her favorites could not have been happier

was greeted with a complimentary smoked salmon bruschetta starter a nice welcome the beef was awesome cooked to perfection as was the pork and the lobster was great daughter choose the rocket pear salad that we all got stuck into desert was fabulous we shared the pavlova the baked chocolate mouse as well as some of their home made gelato  banana was the winner

the wait staff were good surprised to read some negative comments here all were very helpful attentive and speedy

all of us said what a great night it was

if you are in shanghai for just a few days understand you may get tempted by flashy expensive restaurants on the bund do try them but if you here for a while try mr willis you wont go wrong and you will see where the people who live here go for celebrations and a very reliable meal in a great atmosphere, i love this restaurant and i am always coming back when visiting shanghai great atmosphere and very nice setting the food is always good and has a really mentionable wine list service is also very good, great food in mr willis located next door to baker and spice on anfu lu good selection of seafoods and a lot of pizzas too, they really know how to cook chicken they make chicken perfectly tender so moist so tasty however the beefs in the neighbouring tables looked so good that will go to taste after the weather cools down a bit, one of the best brunch i have ever had in shanghai great food and portion is just nice chicken is really tender and excellent taste service  maybe the restaurant is too busy thus service is soso and because the restaurant is so popular they are very strict with the timing of their seatings if you are on the 1st seating when the time is up you better get going as the service staff will keep bugging you and remind you of the time no choice you just have to accept it to be fair to the guests on the next seating, the roast chicken is to die for  the thing to order every time service is good i always bring out of towners here a guarantee of good food good atmosphere and great services which is so rare in big metro cities these days especially in shanghai two thumbs up, thoroughly enjoyed our evening at mr willis food was good wine flowed well and the staff were both friendly and attentive
all in all worth a visit, really enjoyed this restaurant in the heart of the french concession  very lively atmosphere and excellent  attentive but not overbeating service  very good menu and although i was steered by my host in the direction of the chicken dish  it certainly did not disappoint  wonderful taste and critically not a hint of any dryness  very good wine list covering multiple jurisdictions at what for a hong kong resident were very reasonable prices , a colleague recommended this restaurant on a recent business trip to shanghai so glad they did mr willis was a delightful meal we ordered the paterillete appetizer the roasted suckling pig and the saffron risotto i would say that the suckling pig and pate were better than the risotto  it was a bit on the dry side but still a delicious meal and the interior decor is really lovely this is a third floor walk up restaurant  so probably not a great choice for anyone whos not comfortable with the climb or needs special access other than that go we didnt have any trouble walking in for dinner on a wednesday night around 7pm but i get the impression this place could be a lot more crowded on the weekends, good buzz in this place at weekends menu is varied and prices are reasonable worth a visit can also order the pizzas from their pizza restaurant downstairs la strada, awesome simple and tasty food and excellent service homelike atmosphere and international guests the restaurant was full and very busy but we didnt have to wait very long between the dishes the only negative was that the chairs at least mine was very uncomfortable, best international menu with italian and australian plate good and fast service i love the lam ribsand pizza too, this place is awesome their menu is very western but with delivery with an eastern flair as others have stated the margarita pizza is outstanding the roast chicken is excellent and even the tbone fantastic it in a complex with a few other bistros all owned by the same restaurateur who knows the formula if your looking for a little taste of home away from home this is the place, yummy food and service with a smile however there was a timing issue with courses during lunch as i ordered the lunch set and my friend ordered a la carte i was still early into working on the starter when they brought out my main my friend ordered soup and salad requesting the salad as her main the server brought out her salad first and then the soup but the timing was rushed very rushed and offawkward that it would have made one of us eating a course while the other watched or one of us leaving a dish to become cold while politely waiting for the others dish to arrive my friend asked them to take back my salmon main until i was ready and the server did i think the staff is intent on providing very good servicejust needs some more periodic guidance to make the experience seamless for the guest
delightful pavlova with berries and scrumptiously moist orange almond cake for dessert, we visited mr willis for a charity event and were so glad we did we tried a range of startersthe standout one being the prawns the best dish of the evening had to be the roast chicken it was so tasty definitely the best roast chicken we have had in shanghai the atmosphere and decor is warm and welcoming too the waiters were helpful and attentivewe will definitely be going back, advised by many in shanghai as a place to go to we went in excited to try the famed mr willis the restaurant is situated in a lovely area on anfu lu the restaurant has a great vibe and you could imagine to be anywhere in the world the menu had all the standards pasta pizza etc etc while i must admit the food was adequately prepared it was overpriced for what it provided a pasta main for usd 50  realy it never ceases to amaze me how restaurants continue to over charge without really delivering we left hungry dissatisfied and completely ripped off certainly a miss ironically people will continue to pay due to the lack of options for anyone who has traveled be prepared to be amazed what these restaurants get away with, returned to mr willis after a few years and had the roast chicken dinner still good still buzzing still great service, mr willis is a must do on a lazy shanghai weekend great starters freshly prepared egg dishes served with details for the eye followed by mr willis very own grilled chicken is always a delight i returned there for several times the service like everywhere in shanghai is on higher level but details such as how to open a champagne bottle within 1 minute or the order to dishes starter main dessert sometimes becomes a bit out of control the phillipino headwaitress is always present and loud could be a bit more warm tho cudos and i will be back again, the menu at mr willis is quite eclectic we had a sushimi stater cheese and fig salad and a blue cheese souffle to start all all were good tastes but quite a range of flavors and textures the wine by the glass was a matiwiti sauv blanc and it was surprisingly well matched to all 3

for mains we had the grilled seabass w mushrooms
and a seafood stew quite like a cioppino  both also very tasty
and with a glass of the house red

interesting ambiencedark but with directed lightreminded me of a few
different sf restaurants

a nice change of pace from typical asian food in china and a a good locals regular scene was what i was told, i have been to this restaurant several times i love the food the cozy atmosphere and ambiance in the restaurant its not fancy but more of a neighborhood place i almost always order the goat cheese souffle and one of the rocket salads to start then their famous roast chicken with roasted pumpkin mash all of these are scrumptious in particular the roasted chicken dish i could eat it every night this time was with a crowd so also tried the steak mashed potatoes and the fish special both of which were delicious for dessert i usually gravitate towards the berry pavlova deep rich berry flavor with nice meringue texture and cream inside we tried this time also the baked chocolate mousse which was a favorite at the table this is one of my go to restaurants when i am tired of the fancy restaurants on the bund and am ready for some home cooking i highly recommend it, i went there several times
i never understood why people like this place so much
granted it was hyped at the beginning and granted it keeps its quality constant the general quality of food is a little below what it should be at this price, we went to mr willis for dinner after receiving rave reviews from friends we were sadly disappointed whilst the ambience and location is great the restaurant failed to deliver the standard of food we were expecting given the high prices and hype the souffle starter was great and the wine selection is one of the best in shanghai i wish we had stopped after the starter as the mains and desserts were disappointing i would perhaps come back for a selection of starters and wine but would not return for a full on meal, this was one of a number of restaurants recommended by a friend who lives in the area but i did expect the food to be so goodi can understand locals frequenting this placegreat atmosphere with outlook over a veranda to the tops of plain trees we had lunch for 7  it wasnt busy so cannot comment on the service the antipasto was excellent smokey eggplantroasted capsicumquail eggs all delicious snapper tartare  baked snapper with mushrooms also vg prices 170200 rmb per head no wine wine list looked good  prices not absurd  the consensus was the food was tastier than hakkasan the night before  half the price we would go back for dinner if we had the timerecommended, we went to mrwillis three times in a week for dinner because it was conveniently located for meetings with old friends during a short visit we found that the atmosphere was consistently pleasant and the place well filled but the food was a bit uneven all appetizers that we tried were good but some main courses were flops such as the asparagus risotto others were good one day but not the same on another day such as the prawns fettuccine the suckling pig was always a success but surprisingly variable in portion size
some reviewers are unhappy about the service i wouldnt go so far as to complain about it but some more efforts in customer friendliness might be helpful in terms of interior decoration the management might consider throwing out some of the carpets
i will probably go there again but probably less often during my next visit, excellent atmosphere intimate and cozy with lots of comfort food love this place for brunch and dinners aussie craig willis aims to please book ahead because of its popularity oh complaint is that the main hostess always seems stressed and can have an attitude if youre late or change the booking food is consistently good, living in shanghai for almost 8 years have we visited this place regular
its always a good evening with great food and for a reasonable price
heads up for this owner and his staff perfect service waiter william is the best
snapper tartare scallops with lentilles chicken liver pate seafood couscous the best meat in town and many more dishes that are superb
dont try that all at once
enjoy, i always enjoy this restaurant the food is always great very nice atmosphere and service wonderful craig the chef is a wonderful and talented guy and also gives a lot back to the community and especially the underprivileged so always great to support him too food is always delicious using the freshest ingredients on the 3rd floor above baker and spice on anfu road consistently good, mr willis is a real find beautifully cooked western food served by friendly staff with impeccable courtesy will return definitely, though i work very close to mr willis i dont often get to go but it is always a treat when i go ive been a number of times for business and pleasure and will continue to go back the food is exceptional good wine and great location it isnt cheap but for shanghai and the quality its worth it, after a week in shanghai i was craving bacon and eggs  simple to the point  easily wanted not easily found

turn to web and find mr willis  pictures and reviews all said go 

honestly the best eggs benedict if you could even compare to that  i have ever had
english muffin eggs just perfect smoked salmon spinach and big slices of bacon wow wow wow

my cohort decided to have the asparagus pizza from la strada downstairs  again wow nice size  thin crust  done in their brick oven in restaurant

i will be back for diner  can only imagine
yes a little pricey but then worth every yuan, yes the food is good but pricey i went here because i loved discovering new restaurant and hopefully to enjoy the experience personally i think the workers here are terrible you cannot feel the passion when it comes to service i mean this is not cheap restaurant the manager or the head foreign waitress who looks very old is very rudemakes us feel that you cannot afford to eat in this restaurant always give us frown face everytime we asked for something she is not well trained and she is not even says thank you or goodnight when we passed by in the front door not even smile i hope mr willis pay more attention to teach his service you charged so much we deserved good service at all i am not a writey person type but our experience last saturday night really get me upset and i found myself writing and to you foreign waitress your such a mess in the restaurant, went alone sunday evening without a reservation fearing they would be full the restaurant turned out to be well visited but still with a few empty tables

for starters i had the olives bread and cheesesticks the olives were very good but the bread was somewhat plain and the cheesesticks were downright boringnot worth eating 

for the main course i had the tbone steak which was juicy and tender i ordered it mediumrare and it was coocked perfectly i prefer my steaks on the bloody side and this was definitely not coocked for more than mediumrare good searing and relatively light flavored sauce that allowed me savor the natural delicious flavor of the steak

the specialty brew pale ale was not bad but not special either plus it was served to cold however that is probably the favored temperature of the normal clientele

at a little over 400 rmb it is not cheap but would not consider it expensive either and worth the money, this is another restaurant that was recommended to me i must say that the food was superb but maybe on the expensive side so once a month treat is ok as usual in china the service was super quick everything was fresh as far as i can see fresh fruit juice fresh seafood and fresh fruits for dessert the clientele is a mix of local and lau wai foreigners no doubt a very hype place to hang out in the quartier is also very nice and calm after meal i was able to walk back to my hotel which was the radisson blu xingguo plaza 1520 minutes walk away around this restaurants are a few independent boutiques price are a little high i find no doubt for foreigners rather than locals, have a few complaints i would hope at the price they charge for food that the wait staff would pay more attention to the patrons i saw a pregnant lady waving her hands at the wait staff only to be ignored again and again i felt so bad that i helped her wave him down but when we finally got his attention he just turn to her and said wait a minute ok in a very rude manner

the same waiter never filled the water glass at his tables while others did also forgetting to bring drinks that were ordered until we asked for it ive been to restaurants in shanghai that charge far less but the wait staff service is that of a 5 star restaurant come on guys get with the program with this type of service i will think twice before going to you guys again

also your steak quality have declined tremendously at the same price you charge for steak i rather foot a few more rmb and get a better high quality steak at mortons think this is the last time i give you my money mr willis you really need to train your staff better, i looked up good western restaurants to go to for my visit to shanghai this place came up and the reviews were very positive
to my disappointment the selection of food was so limited and not worth the price rmb78 for a tiny bowl of salad  and the pizza was salty
the decor and ambience was nice but i will never dine there, mr willis is one of our favorite restaurants in shanghai and that is not only because we live just around the corner though you have to reserve because it is immensely popular this is the place we choose when we want a relaxing dinner the chicken liver pate is wonderful so is the sea bass ceviche their signature fried chicken is to die for though yes it is only chicken it comes with a delicious baked pumpkin that id love to imitate and we usually order rosemary potatoes as a side i am sad i have never really been able to indulge in their deserts there is no room for dessert after a dinner like that generous portions prices high but not excessively so the balcony with planets gives a nice summer feeling right now, great menu both food and wine  spirits really only for the elite prices are very high but the food is amazing call for reservation, adding my endorsement to this very nice restaurant high marks for its delicious food warm service and lovely ambient what i like most about this place was the luscious green landscape at the balcony which help creates a sense of sereneness to the whole ambient a very welcome features that provides a sanctuary like feel for those who need a virtual break from the city great job, dropped in for a casual dinner last night with no reservation we were quickly seated easy atmosphere good service delicious food and a happy time the bread that came with the cheese was stale so watch out for that we didnt complain as by then we were quite full

i wouldnt hesitate to suggest a visit i am sure it has its off days just like everywhere else but give it a try and good luck, mr willis is located on the top floor of a building half way down anfu lu the clientele is is a decent mix of western and chinese and the restaurant sees a mainly older crowd

the dining area is welcoming and open with a view over a wellrun kitchen mr willis menu is mainly european in style and as and they also own the pizza restaurant on the ground floor la strada pizza is offered too

some of the dishes are a little expensive but the food is hearty and good the service is excellent and the staff are friendly

mr willis is a good choice for nonasian food in shanghai, this is one of my favourite restaurants in shanghai  great menu with great food and great servicespecials of oysters and other dishesvery very fresh and creative, in our 10 years in shanghai this is definitely one of the restaurants that weve visited the most times the food is consistently excellent with our favourites including the scallops with curry lentils pate roast chicken and sticky date pudding the pizzas provided by the pizzeria on the ground floor are also very good  try the prosciutto service is excellent and the wine is very reasonably priced a great place to wind down with friends after a hard week booking advised as its very popular, mr willis is always a nice place to golunch or dinner no matter whether it is full or moderately full and its always generally busy due to its popularity i think you will always be assured that the service will be sleek and friendly and the food always yummy ive been coming here more or less since the place first opened and have never been disappointed the openkitchen here really works and creates a nice intimacy between kitchen and diner actually the whole room works well and givesoff a nice relaxed atmosphere and the balcony only adds to this with its garden of potted plants herbs and bonsai trees food portions are always generous some may think they are a bit oversized but certainly there is real pricevalue to be had here food style reflects a contemporary australian touch and therefore avoids overhandling and fussy presentations food here is real foodand of the highest quality the wine list is quite extensive for the size of restaurant and offers some very wellchosen wine bytheglass selections also available in halfbottle carafe the selection of freshly prepared fruit juice combinations are also a delight and an added bonus overall the consistency in food service ambience and the feelgood feelings i always get here leaves me with no hesitation in recommending this restaurant and rating it as excellent, been there for dinner with friends we were in 5 and we have been accomodated in the one of the round tablewas a while i was not going in there
warm atmosphere as usual and the service is always very good with prompt attention and care by the staff
i was remembering a fantastic tender big and juicy steak and so i went for itrare as i like itbut i was let a little down it was a good one but not remarkably good as i had consistentlyin the pastsame was for my friends
everithing else was fine from the wine to the selection of various appetizer we took
i hope it has been just a bad luck or unfortunate cut or maybe not aussie beefand so next time in shanghai i will surely give another try, loved this restaurant and i will be back the atmosphere was very welcoming great music the kind you dont notice friendly and helpful staff the booths are very comfortable the food is excellent we had the goat cheese souflee a simple salad and the duck it was plenty of food for two people i will definitely be back, a local friend recommended to go for brunch to mr willis and on a rainy and cold shanghai sunday afternoon it was a really good idea the wooden decor made us feel warm and the atmosphere had a cozy feeling with a very international array of customers ordering though was not easy because options were a bit limited and close to half of the menu is pizza from the downstairs restaurant for a sunday bruch i ended up ordering pancakes with berry compote and maple syrup and a carrot pineapple and mint juice the juice was fantastic and made me feel quite good but unfortunately the pancakes despite the berries and the syrup were somehow bland and lacking flavor my friend ordered a salad and though he liked it we both thought that portions were on the small side at this restaurant so a good experience in general but dont go there too hungry, its been a year since weve been to mr willis having been tempted by the incredible choice of restaurants in shanghai
i am so glad we did a reminder that quality produce cooked simply sensational service great wine list and a relaxed but sophisticated ambiance is really all you need
its not often in restaurants in this city that all of those elements come together like they do at mr willis

16,"we have just arrived in shanghai and wanted a break from chinese for lunch  i saw the great reviews on trip advisor and my wife was not feeling well she wanted the chicken soup for a light lunch  i ordered the large smoked meat platter  pastrami and a moosehead beer  my wife really liked the chicken soup which was perfect  while i do not have a comparison in montreal i do in new york city  carnegie  rip   katz and second avenue deli  tocks delivered a great pastrami platter with rye bread  rye bread and great french fries  we loved it and i think you will too  great value in shanghai the large pastrami platter was $ 98 yuan the smaller $ 78 , if you want the deli feel of eastern north america this is the place to go
the smoked meat was as lean or fatty as the ones served in the delis of montreal, i can believe didnt went there before this is fantastic smoke meat i feel like i was on montreal for time seat there fantastic food this is a place to add on your to do list every trip i will be here had the chance to meet richard and very well receive lome we know each other since long time will return on every trip good job, introduced to this place by a friend and is always now on the list of options when thinking about somewhere to eat offers great tasty food my personal favourite being the grilled cheese sandwich lots of meat and sandwich options and a good drinks menu to boot my eyes always light up when someone says how about tocks, visited with canadian friends have tried a few dished but its all about the reuben you get a choice of lean medium or fatty meat fatty is the only way to go its tender and melt in the mouth good selection of beers a little pricey for shanghai but so worth it, we enjoyed dinner at tocks a few weeks ago and it was lovely to be surrounded by so much canadian and quebecois ambiance while enjoying reuben sandwiches moosehead lager and poutine the poutine features cheddar and not squeaky cheese curd but the fries are delicious and the gravy nice and dark considering cheese curd would be impossible to find here this was an excellent poutine the entire meal made us feel like wed been transported to montreal for awhile and the food was delicious, my favourite is the reuben sandwich but has a great overall menu as well high quality meat never been disappointed not the best location but luckily they do home delivery via sherpa, nice little place good drinks had magners irish cider  supposedly our prime minister ate her before  fries not my favorite but look homemade thin coleslaw was ok  but meat is awesome can get three different ways  learn medium and fat  well worth a try , i arrived at tocks with extremely high expectations after reading about being able to order a reuben with a lot of fat on the pastrami in fact tocks pastrami sandwich was probably the thing i most looked forward to on my brief business trip to shanghai

was i ever not disappointed the reuben even though i took it back to my hotel room to eat because i arrived at tocks in midafternoon too early for dinner was juicy and delicious the fatty pastrami reminded me of what they served at carnegie deli rip in nyc but even fattier which imho is a good thing

i would be remiss to not mentioned the skinon thin and slightly crispy fries these fries were delicious and served in such quantity that i could not finish all of them

the cole slaw was also delicious but was relegated to bronze because my focus was entirely on the pastrami and the fries other edibles in the bag were ketchup and mustard perfect

i should not fail to mention how courteous tocks staff is the guy explained my menu options and although i was considering an order of poutine pointed out that my order came with fries or a salad adding an order of poutine just would have been way too much food for me to finish also they served me a warm glass of water while i waited at a table for my order to be completed  which did not take long at all

i dont often look forward to traveling to shanghai so finding tocks might make me look forward to my future visits there, great place not far from the bund center food is great and service as well prices are okay for shanghai level we took some drinks after dinner however the place is closing after 2230 everything was great will surely come back to this place, tocks an oasis of western food in one crazy city  just across the road from the westin this became our fav lunchtime hangout the rueben is off the chain the smoked meat really is that good owner steven is a great guy and the waiting staff ruby and ben the two best and friendliest we encountered on our trip bottle of moosehead or really nice house wine to wash it down too , we had a great lunch wonderful food and excellent service cool ambience and very friendly good value for money the manager is a great character and we will return recommended, i had the smoked chicken sandwich and it was fantastic they also had dr pepper which is harder to find in china, picked up a sandwich for takeaway after reading a review online ordered the rueben based on the recomendation of the waiter great taste too bad the fries were too oily, we stumbled upon this little gem walking down to yu garden taking a picture of the sign for for montreal smoked meat and thinking nothing else about it the following day we wanted something that we were familiar with and could scarf down knowing what it was and we thought of tocks great food great atmosphere helpful staff and i believe it was the owner who came around and asked how everything was overall great place to get food thats reminds you of home we even ate there twice, best smoked beef sandwiches in shanghaiand maybe china i always take overseas guests here if they want a taste of home, i was extremely pleased with my experience here being my first day in shanghai alone so i was a bit nervous about navigating the subways to find this place but i am so glad i did the staff here spoke great english and i was seated in a matter of seconds after walking in once i ordered my food arrived in a few short minutes i chose the chicken pastrami sandwich and it was delicious another plus that they took credit cards, wed penciled this in as a must visit but didnt know where it was one day quite fortuitously we stumbled on it when looking for a lunch venue it is everything youd want or need in a lunch restaurant cold beer great deli foods and good music all in air conditioned comfort with great service, we heard about this deli on our cruise ship and as my wife is from canada we wanted to try it went for lunch small restaurant not fancy focused on meat sandwich dishes we ordered the extra lean montreal beef and it was still a bit fatty for my taste although it tasted good and was not a sizable portion   more moderate portion price was moderate for lunch, happy ro have this place close to the office having a good lunch for a normal price there meat medium is quite nice and i enjoy it every time to get it

maybe in china they could also start to offer alipay or wechat pay like many other places thanks, i always enjoyed my meals there i trained in themcgill univ residency progamme half a century ago and loved to talk montreal with brian
dr mike, what a fabulous spot great food fantastic atmosphere and a little taste of home in the middle of shanghai definitely worth a visit, as we have been ill for the last 45 days in hainan it was a nice start to start eating again 
food was good and atmosphere also very western the service was also good and fast, third visitdidnt disappoint after weeks of travelling through china a visit to tocks was high on my list comfort canadian cuisine loved it, as vegetarian we sometimes have difficulties to find food around here the staff was super polite the service was quick and the food was good and perfect size differently an option if you cant eat chinese food anymore, popped in here as i fancied a bit of comfort food and the reviews seemed good i can confirm that the ruben is indeed very very good i only ordered the medium one but it was still huge comes with skinny fries and a little pot of coleslaw really good bread hard to find in china and excellent beef

probably wouldnt come here in the evening for a fancy meal as its more of a lunch spot but nevertheless if youre in the mood for some good filling eats then this place fits the bill yum

also the staff speak some english which always makes things a bit easier if youre near the bund then this place is very close by when you need a break from taking selfies, im from la and desperately miss corned beef pastrami etc now theres not so much choice here but the quality is great poutine is also amazing server was very helpful and not sky to give good advice on what i should get definitely will go again, this was about my 5th time visiting tocks and its still a good place to eat as ive said before its not montreal but the food is still good i believe the meat is shipped in from canada
french fries are excellent coleslaw is good and the sandwich is excellent honestly though they need more meat on the sandwich and a larger coleslaw in montreal its a fight to finish a sandwich here i want more to eat
anyway its china go have a sandwich here its a welcome change from normal food in china, we came here for a bite to eat after hearing nice things abouti ate the chefs salad  it was average at best  my husband  a real carnivore + big eater had the duck platter and smoked meat reuben in the large portionupgraded the fries to poutine when you order your meal you can select the fatness of the meathis only complaint was the bread was sort of mediocre not toasted service was shaky but friendly a couple of things were forgotten and the manager nice about it and apologizedit was a decent meal  we went back a second time, tocks reflects the montreal spirit with its terrace and the atmosphere the smoke meat is the closest you will ever get to a montreal smoke meat so if you feel like you need a little bit of home or you want to share a bit of our culture to the locals visit tocks, i live in china and was going to pick up some friends at the airport in shanghai i am from montreal so when i can i try to stop at tocks to get my fix of montreal smoked meat 
i of course always take the opportunity to pack up some meat  sous vide so that i can enjoy a little more of these when i am back home

service a little slow but its fine give us time to enjoy our delicious beer sitting on the outdoor terrace french fries are perfect tiny and well fried i recommend it without a doubt nothing chic or fancy  just good comfort food , went because of tripadvisor high up on the list

hugely disappointed as the air conditioning doesnt seem to make the place cold bread is mediocre the fries are too greasy and under cooked the bread seems not from same day cole slaw ver mediocre ordered side of pickles and got a plate of sliced pickles never ever saw that in a deli

as a deli expert this should be called more as a sandwich place maybe alright if never been to deli before but this is far from it wouldnt recommend, wish we had more places like this back in los angeles the smoked beef sandwich is a awesome change from the local shanghai dining just what i would want in a smoked beef sandwich with fries, the place looks ok from the roadside but you certainly get much more than you expect when the food comes all the sandwiches are to die for  i had the ruebens and was as good as the first time  dont miss this for lunch  just miss breakfast , i called into tocks with my family for lunch after a recommendation from friends and i have to say i wasnt disappointed

we chose a selection of two meat dishes poutine and a pastrami sandwich i liked the fact that you could choose how fatty you liked your pastrami and it really was very good sadly i couldnt say the same for chicken which was a little dry but tasty none the less

there are plenty of drinks to choose from so youll not dehydrate during your day out

the deli isnt a big place but it is comfortable and the staff friendly and efficient pricing is reasonable and the bill for the 3 of us 2 adults and a young child came to around 400rmb <u+00a3>40 or $50us

a great place to stop for lunch and well be back, flavorful sandwiches at reasonable price i ordered ruebens sandwich with fries and coleslaw on the side my son is a bit disappointed since original poutin is not available to try they ran out of gravy instead he tried meat sauce poutin which he also like for dessert we tried the freshly baked cookie dough with ice cream staffs are friendly and service is fast we will surely come back, im living in shanghai and have visited recently several times tocks always great food especially the smoked beef, everything was delicious ordered pastrami sandwiches and poutine 1st time eating both wont be the last, for the visitors that are getting sick of eating chinese and missing a good ol american reuben tocks is definitely the place to go best pastrami and smoked meats this side of the pacific a bit on the pricy side but expected since were thousands of miles from home, first time i went there was for a quick lunch fix didnt expect much as ive learned not to with all these chinesemakebelieve restaurants that serve international cuisines the location is quite near my office very convenient for me i think tocks winning point is the staff they listened so attentively they were so willing to offer their suggestionseven tweaked the menu a little ohdid i mention they let you sample their beef right after you have a seat its like before you say anything maamtry this
with the help of a very involved waiter i made my order grilled cheese with a side of coleslaw and poutine the poutine was a neat substitute for the plain fries served with all sandwichesthe food was good or was i just hungry nooit was great if you need a break from noodles and rice slurping chopsticksand more noodleshit me up for some tocks time this place just takes you awaythe ambiance is relaxing not loud but a good selection of music that you dont even realize youre enjoying and ofcourse u guessed it i told a friend and then another friendand weve been going back there a little more than we should, if youre craving something different than the typical chinese fare in shanghai then you are in luck my friends i just had a fantastic pastrami sandwich that took me back to the north east usa that is paired with an order of poutine fries with gravy and cheese curds for those unfamiliar and a coke this was a great meal brian the owner a montreal native even comes out from the kitchen to personally meet his guests and talk a little hockey or football this was a great experience and i will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu, the reviews were right had the rueben monster size really good like eating at a jewish deli in new york they even give you a sample to try out before recommended, for those craving the french canadian staple look no further it fills that void and is a welcome addition to shanghai that being said the prices are rather high and there are no pickles which is frankly a travesty also the decor is rather boring it would be cool if they had something like schwartzs in montreal or katz on nyc with pictures of famous people who have passed by the moosehead beer is a nice touch but more beer selection would be great also they serve bloody marys but no ceasars which is also disappointing, they have an amazing reuben sandwich with really american styled smoked meats moist and thick cuts i visited their shanghai centre outlet and was truest impressed unfortunately that branch has closed and their main outlet is too out of the way for me if you are nearby definitely worth a pop by in, with all the great local food available in shanghai many may think its crazy to eat at a deli sandwich type place but hey i love some pastrami tocks isnt a small unassuming place perfect for lunch the quality of the meats was excellent and where else can you get duck pastrami my wife got the rueben which was excellent i got the three meat platter as i want to try the chicken as well all was absolutely tasty we also enjoyed a lunch special of two ice cold draft asahi beers for 38 rmb the staff was super and spoke good english hey it was a short walk from our hotel too, tocks without questions serve up some amazingly authentic and delicious smoked meats i would have like to see a larger selection of craft beer and a few healthier sides but honestly can not complain this place is good for montreal and its located in shanghai, amazing food and service everything was so good we enjoyed it very much for our lunch here in shanghai  the place is also very clean and not expensive , on our trip to visit friends in shanghai they introduced us to this nice little deli i am a picky eater who is used to american food and not very adventurous so this fit the bill for me i had the grilled cheese with chicken and it was delicious the people in our party all had different items and everyone was more than pleased we enjoyed it enough to visit tocks twice during our trip to shanghai, i have been lucky enough to spend a lot of time in montreal and really learned to enjoy one of the citys unique treasures montreals smoked meat has always been a real delight i was passing through shanghai and was gobsmacked to find this place smoked meat was imported from montreal fantastic
the smoked meat and fries were great and had some matzo ball soup as well definitely worth dropping in also had some moosehead beer, been here two or three times when i need a break from chinese food always for the smoked beef sandwich a smoked meat sandwich at schwartzs is a must any time i go to montreal and tocks equals it from what i can remember just a pile of juicy smoky meat piled up on rye bread with some mustard heaven great crispy fries as well which are not always easy to find in shanghai last time i ate there i considered going back the next day to get another sandwich love this place not cheap by local standards but well worth it","bar",0.984332460394446
160,"met with friends for a wednesday wings night and the wings were pretty good since im not into wings that much though i also ordered myself a burger and must say it was pretty decent, lots of expats there for a special 2 rmb wing night they do on wednesdays the wings were good and the beer was good if you like a lot of people and noise then this is a good place for you if youre looking for somewhere quieter i wouldnt recommend, amazing place atmosphere except for all the smoke food and service one of my favorite places to eat and chill they have specials all week long that are super cheap for really good food, lots happening heresport beer pool friendly great pub food the manager ryan is an australian gem recommend, great little sportsbar where i keep coming back to watch football ok selection of beers and drinks as well as food but the real winner are the chicken wings i keep coming back only for that, the shed is a good pub popular with expats great selection of international beers plenty of sport not fancy just a straight forward pub, the steak is great i ordered the rump with veggies and mash wow back home id be paying $80 for the same quality good selection of beers level pool table what more do you want do your self a favor visit the shed if your home sick and want some pub food and a pub atmosphere all the best robert, tucked away  is one of shanghai greatest bars a very healthy mix of expat and locals  always showing a diverse selection of sports

pray to god youre there for wing night  some of the best prepared wings ive had in quite some time  not deep fried or oily  but roasted to perfection

beer is cold the menu is good the crowd is noisy  what more could you ask for, i came to see a friend in shanghai we were staying in different hotels so we decided to meet here the place was quite crowded mainly full of expats drinking a taste of home especially as they serve drinks that you dont normally find in china it was very noisy and smoky but the atmosphere was relaxed and everyone seemed to be having a good time would i recommend it yes i would, friendly pub with only expats free pool table every day some special deal i visited on monday when all the food was half price took the most expensive steak tbone to save as much as possible steak was good as were the sides potato wedges and coleslaw, the western food is well above average for china but only average if you were at home lots of young expats and smoking the great beer selection and prices make up for it, went with a small group to watch the england wales 2016 6 nations match with a midnight ko shanghai time found it easy enough thanks to the excellent j w marriott concierge service writing out the address to show the taxi driver taxis are v v cheap in china this is an aussie owned sports bar with a mixed expat clientele service was at our table and excellently conducted by the ever helpful and smiling staff and to round off a good night we just about managed to hold on to beat the taffs only downside is the no smoking inside culture hasnt got to china in any substantial way yet and the smell of my clothes when i finally came round net morning was a horrendous reminder of the bad old days not the fault of the venue and not one i would mark them down for great night out decent beer and good company and not only from and with our own group the regulars were very welcoming and convivial too highly recommended if its your thing, friendly neighborhood pub aussie owned and specialises in keeping drink prices low all day every day good place for cheap beer and sports and they have a nice menu of pub grub too friendly staff and a welcoming vibe
mon 4pm12am half price on main dishes
wed 2rmb chicken wings
fri 68pm half price on drinks, nice place to be eat have some drinks good place to hang out with friends you can play pool and dart, nice place to watch sport and drink beer at affordable prices
friendly mix of foreigners and local chinese
cheap food menu and drinks, they have their loyal clientele who comes regularly big pool table with regular pool night darts several large screens for sport events cool kilkenny and and even a basket where you can take home dvds and leave a donation nice place friendly people food is a bit mixed the vegetable plate huge board to share was good so were the quesadillas the onion rings and the calamares did not make it hot to our table and were on the greasy side one of our party had the hamburger and was bit underwhelmed overall nice to hang around enjoy a few good hours but remember its not necessarily about the food, while staying in shanghai and looking for a place to gran a beer we stumbled upon the shed

nice and friendly hosts friendly crowd and good food and beer there are two darts tables and a pool table tvs are on showing sports like any other sportsbar in the world

it was a nice retreat from the otherwise intense shanghai but do not expect it to be typically chinese in any way, if you�re a foreigner and want to feel like you�re at home the shed is the place the shed is usually filled with foreigners a great party atmosphere and enjoyable activities being played like pool and darts there is even an area where you can trade old movies available for visitors 

there are great discounts on meals throughout the work week for meals randing from chicken wings burgers and even steak

the shed is a place that you can bring a date or bring a group to and have a great time

the one problem i see is that the shed has a tin roof which leads to bad cellphone reception besides that there is wifi available but the speed is sometimes slow depending on the amount of customers, its a fun place to go with young friends great selection of beers and prices all resonance
i ordered a burger which the meat was overcooed and very dry snacks were served with chipped and dirty containers we commented to the staff who seems not really understood the situation and run away until we paid for the bill no one came to chat with us we left with a broken heart
shall i go back for drinks probably but will never order the food again, laid back western style bar in jingan district food and drinks competitively priced for shanghai with offers most evenings best deals are probably half price mondays food and friday evening happy hour lots of tvs showing sports it also has a very nice pool table and decent darts area worth a visit if you need a quick drink or have a game to see, hi i have been to the shed on numerous occasions each time the atmosphere was great after a while the staff learns recognizes you and calls out your name when you come in the food is great high quality and reasonable prices especially for shanghai the menu is half off on mondays and you can get a steak

beer is good we can all agree the shed has a good beer selection and you can get good imported beer at good prices hard to find in shanghai

i completely recommend the shed, a easy place you can through all the pressures away enjoying your time with friends or even strangers to celebrate for your beloved football team there are darts snookers and big size tv provided its really a good place where you can have fun, the shed offers drinks food and games at the fraction of the cost of other similar bars on the shanghai scene delivering a nice low key atmosphere for relaxing and enjoying a game of darts with cheap wings over a bottle of pure blonde

it does get busy on different food specials nights and if you dont make it there in time on their wings night you could find that wings have been sold out, nice bar in jingan district  most of the usual suspects on tap and a couple of decent ipas too it also has lots of screens so i usually head there for any big sports matches food good for a bar and some kind of special most nights, this is one of those bars that people become regulars that or whenever you show up theres somebody you know that is there its a good mixed crowd young and old newbies to shanghai and veterans of years

i love this place ive been here at least 20 times they have some really nice deals such as halfprice monday steaks and wednesday chicken wing night food is really well priced here

and even when there is no promotions going on the prices are pretty fair for what you get and of course the beers are at a decent price 25rmb carlsberg

theres a pool table  with two dartboards in the back plenty of space you got your regular tables your tall tables short coffee tables the bar itself

if youre looking for a decent place with decent food at a decent price the value for what you get here is spot on my only complaint is that on mondays steak nights it does take some time to get the food because its so packed, been to these bar countless time during my stay in shanghai it�s a good place to hangout with friends and chili out to watch some games pool table and dart are also available in the bar it�s very typical neighborhood bar to be there besides they have some big screen to show the major sports events which is the highlight for those sport fans
the price of beer is reasonable and got various selections to choose from the cheapest one is carlsberg which is rmb 35 and 25 during happy hour the happy hour if i remembered right is between 5 to 8 pm everyday which is really nice in an expensive city like shanghai besides the drinks they provide the typical bar food tastes are decent and easy to fulfill your stomach they have some weekly food deal which you need to find ourselves
the environment is not so glamorous as the chic bar on the bund but � the shed� has its charm to be there, a great hangout for locals and expats alike really helped me get adjusted to life in sh have 10 tvs with almost anything you could ask for tuna melt was good wings were amazing but the conversation was better, monday 50 discount on food huge steak 84rmb and huge hot dog 28rmb
darts billiard
opened till 5am and full every day, the shed is basically an expat meeting place its smoky noisy and packet but it is worth it on mondays food is half prices try the stakes and wednesday chicken wings 2 rmb piece draws people to enjoy every time i miss the old englishamerican style pub i will visit, food was excellentrump steak out of this world
both staff and other customers were very friendly making it a very pleasant atmosphere to either play pool or dartsor just relax in a quiet area with a cool drink, when you need a few beers this aussieowned place is a great place to wind down with a pool table and dart boards and several televisions this is my usual meeting place when getting together with friends highly recommended for the start if a long night out or to watch sporting events overseas, went there for some beers and playing dart its a typical bar type a bit similar to big bamboo serve guinness and other good beers have food promotion days like wednesday is chicken wing day 2rmb per wing, when you first come across the shed it has a small and unimposing narrow entrance fronted by a small porch with outside seating once inside the place opens up rather dramatically into the main bar area and a pool table clientiele are mostly male expats from australia uk us and canada all there for the multiple tvs featuring sports and the cheap beers eg heineken and tsingtao bottles start from 25 rmb while hoegarden draft costs 35 rmb wines per glass start from 35 rmb the food was rather hitandmiss though we ordered the calamari 35 rmb to 40 rmb but it was not fresh and was rather chewy the beef burger 55rmb was not very substantial though the sesame buns were good the fries could have used a couple more minutes in the frier we also ordered chicken wings 8 for 40 rmb and these were really very tasty in fact every wednesday they offer chicken wings for 2 yuan each and that would certainly be worth visiting the shed again they have other specials on different days like 50 off selected mains on mondays service was quite efficient, although not a sports bar fan the shed is one heck of a great place the fish n chips are the best ive had in shanghai the wings are the absolute best ive had anywhere the steaks are excellent these folks know how to make great food and the prices are reasonable

the drink prices are good all day long with 25 kwai pints 25 kwai dark and stormies i cant say enough positives about this place

as a sports bar the layout is killer with nice pool table and serious competition dart boards
the staff is courteous and the owner seems like a helluva decent bloke

and the fact that the place is full of aussies gives the place the positive atmosphere that i prefer in a bar i will come back again and again and again, the waitress took my order and left before my friend could order usual uncoordinated service but not too long to wait for a beer even on a busy saturday night
dip platter dirty bamboo board with rather old veggie cuts the dips were warm as they most likely were frozen and then heated up in microwave dips tasted awful dry burger patty left most of the food behind
audience consist of overweight bold expats and skinny short skirt local girls if the regulars occupy the pool table you cant get to play, the shed is an aussie sports bar in a funny location that can either be fun or rowdy fun or not or drab depending on the day this last because it can be dark inside in its favour are a several screens showing international sports that rarely if ever have any streaming problems so reliable for big games b a very good drink list including properly poured pints including commercial beers that often taste nasty in shanghai but not here and especially c a surprisingly good food selection in fact so much so that they have food deals almost every day of the week but to name one in particular where else in shanghai can you get a grassfed 400g aussie rumpsteak on monday for less than cny150 not only that but this rump is sensational and one of the best in town i was a bit disappointed by the bone but the lasagna is pretty good as are the barbecue chicken wings at 2rmb a piece all in all for a pub the food hits far above its weight it also has a pool table and a darts area repeat yes, really good local pub if this was in my local area it is not excellent food we thought for a pub also good selection of drinks at very attractive prices i focused on dark n stormy several glasses of said cocktail yes unexpected quality pub just too far for us to get to thanks for welcoming tottenham fans coys, this is a bit far from my home but is my preferred bar in shanghai you wont find a better beer selection anywhere in the city wines are also good and the prices are considerably lower than other expat bars at any hour they have the best pool table and darts area as well food at their new location shaanxi bei lu is much improved and definitely better than what you would call bar food the bar is more geared towards aussies and europeans of which im neither so the sports selection is more directed towards those 2 groups comfortable seating well ventilated im a nonsmoker and large enough so not to feel crowded well worth visiting, shabby fancy has outside seating and dog friendly 2 burgers for 50rmb on tuesdays all prices are great","Turkish cuisine",0.999623238458476
161,"what a find this is as close to being in mexico as you are going to get in shanghai queso fundido enchiladas fish tacos  flautas all great, i was thrilled to find a mexican place in china at all however i was not prepared for just how amazingly delicious this place was it rivals the best mexican restaurants that are actually in mexico great atmosphere for a date night or hanging out with friends seemed to have bands and special events every week staff was outstanding and spoke great english management was attentive and we even met the head chef

the only criticism is that they dont have more locations

this place is not just a diamond in shanghai but a truly great restaurant on this planet

im putting midrange for the price because its in china and our dollar went pretty far however quality and taste of food is definitely fine dining, we are hard core salsa dancers and found that aspect just good  the floor is pretty small the music excessively loud and we dance in bars all the time and the thursday live band was decent with bachata salsa and merengue  during breaks they also played djd reggaton they have a lively salsa scene on thursday nights as mentioned in other reviews

we had the large nachos for $85yuan $13us $65 for the small and they were just good  not much cheese but a nice lemony chaser service was great although we got a good table next to the dance floor

it is a bit of a walk from the mrt station which shuts down at 1030pm which means a cab ride back getting a taxi is easy we actually had two other groups ahead of us and we all got a cab within minutes  just flag one down on the road outside make sure they start the meter dont cover it up half way through and give you a printed receipt from the meter we also made sure with iphone apple maps that the driver was going the right way we used a local sim for internet access suggest china unicom 1gb plan for $106rmb$15usd bring your passport  fyi google including google maps is blocked in shanghai  apple maps is actually awesome for the mrt in shanghai because it gives you the line number color direction and number of stops we used it heavily, good mexican food but the stray cats running around here are gross they are all over  this is the best restaurant in jinqiao i wish they would keep away the gross cats, considering there isnt that many decent mexican food restaurants around pistolera hits the spot when it comes to good food nice outdoor seating and restaurant vibe the enchiladas are delicious my kids love the chicken quesadillas chips  salsa + sol beer, many ex pats hang out here weekly very good mexican food considering were living in shanghai china fun vibe usually busy place and when its nice outside the patio is awesome, this is a decent mexican place in china by china standards its pretty good by american standards its ok i usually eat the tacos, being from southern cal my standard for mexican food is very high that said it was pretty good tacos were legit salsa good margaritas were great the beans were horrible whoever made them had no idea what they were doing a solid effort overall though, this was our first time to pistolera the nachos were tasty and a half serving was perfect for two people we also enjoyed a chimichanga there are many other items on the menu and we hope to enjoy more in the future the only complaints that we had there were way too many jalapenos on the nachos and the rice had a burnt flavor but we wont let that keep us from going back, we went over the weekend for a dinner the ambiance was very lively and they have a nice outdoor seatingmy family mostly likes vegetarian food  and the staff was very accommodating we had burrito mushroom and spinach quesadilla  fajita and shrimp taco you can choose three different tacos  they got the chicken in the side for the fajita as requested the portions are large and they provide a small bowl of nachos complimentary  you should not miss to try their spicy sauces overall we were quite happy with the food and price  value for money for sure, after years of bad texmex food on cantina agave level the original management team is back and quality skyrocketed
bside normal texmex wonderful arrachera steak not known well in europefantastic guacamole and even the salsa with the obligatory nacho chip is fresh and tasty
strongly recommend it, during my visit i went 2 times to this restaurant very nice people the manager lucy is amazing the food is great fresh big plates just all in one perfect also very affordable a very nice change in between all chinese food every day really the location of foreigners and expats, on a hot july sunday searching for a restaurant to have our lunch we found la pistolera and our choice was proved very good the restaurant had outdoors and indoors tablesseats but we preferred to stay inside were the temperature was much more convenient and the decoration nice we really enjoyed our margaritas de la casa fruity etc you name it and the food there we wanted to stay focused on chicken dishes fjitas quesadillas but we could not say no to an arranchera marinada services were good and the dishes satisfactorily big generally we liked it and most probably we will visit it again, it was a great lunch with a chilli bowl some nachos and nba basketball on the television atmosphere is relax and casual, we have been visiting this place and they simply are the worst the quality level between the different pistoleras is enormous in jinqiao restaurant they simply dont pay attention to you ignore you the kitchen took over 1 hour and we had to cancel our food and leave they didnt care they even never gave me my receipt to sign the voucher after i passed the card the food is horrible compared to the other locations and the place is small and terribly noisy the manager was useless and careless if you want to try better places go to pistolera in puxi or el luchador dont try this one you will be disappointed, its hard to comment on the food i can only comment on the complete lack of service we were greeted and given menus and then completely ignored for 15 minutes at which point i left we tried to get their attention but they would not stop we even spoke to one girl as she walked past but she did not come back and went to serve another table if you want any kind of service do not go here, very good mexican food margaritas excellent very close walk from the marriott pudong east or the ramada pudong, food is authentic as chinese mex food goes prices are reasonable and the location is central to the expat bubble in jinqiao outdoor picnic table seating is particularly enjoyable on a niceweather evening very social and pleasant bonus  a dvd seller right outside so grab a movie after you leave worth the trip if you are in jinqiao if staying in marriott pudong east one block walking very convenient, i cannot fault the food it was excellent as was the service except they wanted to close up early that night to prepare for a private party the following day as we were only occupying one table i did think they could have worked around us but what the hell

the shock of the night came with the bill i have been to pudong a few times now and fully expect a hefty tag but this one almost put me in ae

if you dine there you will enjoy the ambience and the fodder just be prepared to pay a premium, there are 4 restaurants one next to other with trees and nice yards in front of them at that area pistolera seems to be the absolute choice of the people among them the restaurant is always alive with people usually shouting because of the music which even is not too high it creates a buzz seems to play in bad quality speakers the decoration and the atmosphere of the restaurant is ok nothing exceptional though the service is good and most of their plates are good too a typical margarita glass costs 50rmb while in bars costs 80100, one of the best mexican restaurants in shanghai nice decorations and good service i definitely will come back, i have to say ive never tasted guacamole quite like this but it was good although not really traditional the tacos al carbon were more like tacos ropa vieja but quite tasty anyway the fresh salsa are excellent and the chips are housemate and warm you can get dos equis beer here  a major plus, a local guy at a shop close by recommended the place to me  im glad he did for the mainly expat area  in comparison to other places it was quite good value for money  enjoyable food with pretty good service i tried a different place the next day but returned as it was by far better quality than other places am looking forward to getting back there in my next visit, i have eaten pistolera twice once as delivery and once in the restaurant the restaurant has an active but cozy vibe to it they were extremely busy when i was there dinner the waitresses are friendly and speak pretty good english i have thoroughly enjoyed all of the food that i have tried which includes the enchiladas and several burritos they are a little more pricy than other mexican options that i have tried but the food is superior, this place is awesome specially the surroundings makes it great right next to a movie theater
good service and cleanliness

i liked a lot, the food is your saverage mexican that you find in asia but what is worth it is the out doors dining area even on a rainy day they have large umbrellas so you can enjoy your food outside, pistolera is my go to place to get mexican food fix i particularly enjoy chorizo nachos plate with chips and salsa, as a big fan of meat i tried their chicken plate and it was very tasty the staff was very polite and the food came pretty quickly highly recommended love it here the best tortilla soup its served warm and spicy the half order of beef nachos is perfect share for 2 best margarita in pudong, this is better than most of the mexican food i get back in ohio they staff is friendly efficient and speak excellent english i just wish they would stock a nonalcoholic beer the ginger beer is good however had a chimichanga last night and spoke with some expat locals ill be back later this week, wandering around looking for somewhere to eat on a dreary sunday night in shanghai and stumbled across pistolera took a chance and was pleased i did great mexican food i had the chicken fajitas reasonable beer choice and very friendly wait staff could not really ask for me not fine dining but a nice relaxing place with a good atmosphere, and maybe all of china best ive had anyway finally proper corn tortillas love the taco fillings particularly the barbacoa ive been hitting this place once a month or so for years and have never been disappointed sometimes i get an extra order of change chicken enchiladas to go because they keep well for a day or two when the weather is right dining on the deck is as good as it gets pujersey, really nice mexican set with wide selection of food that was really tasty beats most of the mexican restaurants in california also really lovely margaritas and nice selection of proper anejo graded tequila

one improvement suggestion goes to the beer selection only the light taste ones available should have some mexican dark too on the list, i have been to this establishment on many occasions and have always been impressed with the level of service and good standard that always greets me however my only negative feedback would be the pricing of the food as it is at the upper end of the acceptable amount of money you would spend on a meal would recommend for their mains but dont waste your money on dessert, if youve had a hard day and need a strong drink to unwind then the tequila and margaritas here are for you the service is good compliments to nancy its difficult for me to review the food objectively because im not a lover of mexican food but the friends i go with tell me its good i do recommend this place when the weather is warm its nice to sit out on the deck, atmosphere and food is great the servers speak english which is very helpful since i do not speak mandarin definitely come here for a fun night, surprisingly good mexican food in china usually this kind of gamble backfires on me my 1st margarita was very good but the 2nd tasted like rail tequila and not cuervo might have been my bad for not specifying it again, best mexican food in town love their tacos i went there for dinner and i tried the tartilla soup and 3 tacos amazing dinner with a house wine at 168 rmb there are above all 2 dishes tim in love with chicken tortilla soup and carne asada nachos the portions here are pretty generous so dont order both of them together margarita is pretty good and they have happy hour prices in different days of the week definitely a place to go with friends above all if you are a salsa lover, pistoleras frozen margaritas are so good and cheap as well
the staff service was great when i was there last time with my husband and kids on eof the best places to go to in pudong, very good mexican food in a very pleasant atmosphere  nice change if on an extended stay in shanghai and tire of chinese food, our expectations of mexican in asia are pretty low so its tough to rate i think our nachos were pretty fresh i think my burrito was tasty and i think my dos xx was cold and not too skunked but im really not sure i guess youll have to go and find out, we chose it for two reasons you can eat late and there is an open air terrace the food was good mexican usual stuff but well presented tasty and abundant the cochinita pibil was perfect i found it unexpensive as well a good option in the french concession, this is a mexican joint with very decent crowd i have to say it is popular
however the food is not as decent as it should be

the grilled meat is chewy and lack of flavor
the chilli bowl is overpower by too much cumin
some of the fried tortilla is as hard as shoe sole

overall it is a good place to hang out with outdoor sitting
but the food is horrible

by the way we asked for the 3rd basket of tortilla chips and the server said we have to pay 15 rmb, have been visiting on and off for the past 4 years and find it better for diningin than for takeaway food the portions are good but lack the oomph from a spice perspective the blackened fish tacos are the best item on the menu the drinks are better but the tendency to dilute the cocktails on the alcohol side is pretty obvious during the early dinner hours suggest a quick lunch as the best goto reason to the restaurant with business colleagues, pistolera has been my go to place for dinner with friends and a few drinks great margaritas and great food over the past few visits it has been pretty consistent
i went this evening and it was really disappointing first main i ordered was a ground beef and cheese enchilada this came absolutely drowning in one of the four choices of sauce the enchiladas were so miserly filled you could literally count the grounds of beef and fluey snot wipe of cheese along the inside looked terribly sad that i sent the entire dish back and switched instead to the tacos with slow cooked beef there was so much watersauceresidue in the beef i could filled a couple of egg cups i asked the waitress who was delightful to tell the chef the food was below expectation i suspect she probably didnt with all the food options in shanghai i will be giving pistolera a miss, the food was ok not close to authentic mexican but close enough to texmex if thats what youre craving i wouldnt go back unless they cut the prices in half or got the food right

i considered walking out without paying the bill after 20 minutes of being ignored by every staff member i waved my arms at finally i got someone to bring me the big check, we were staying very near to biyun and were walking back from carrefour when we thought of trying this restaurant were a bit bored of the chinese food the ambiance was ok but food was nowhere near a true mexican restaurant maybe a bit tuned to chinese taste visit only if you are bored of local food else nothing special, incredible true mexican food jalapeno with cheese cochinita pibil ceviche tostadas to die for great staff lovely neighborhood to go for a walk, pistolera offers fairly good mexican style food the portions are not very big but ok sized especially with some starters food quality bit better than for example mexico lindo price level similar midrange

there are atleast three different pistoleras in shanghai tried the one close lao wai jie, i had dinner at pistolera at the recommendation of a local expat as overseas mexican goes i thought it was quite good the veggie burrito i had was flavorful and not grossly oversized like many you see in the us a small bowl of chips and salsa was brought to the table when we arrived the food arrived quickly and was well presented they have tables inside and out and a texmex decor extends throughout good options for both meat eaters and vegetarians and an extensive drink menu as well, yes the guacamole is not good but the chili was very good thick and had nice spice fish tacos were fair but basically the key is that the joint is full of expats so much that it felt like being in michigan rather than china i knew more people than at home if your looking for something other than expats dont bother but english is all you need here","Taiwanese cuisine",0.499506415297615
162,"im in love of the place with the sea food available and the wine and the type of aroma they have which is pure china flavorful, very expensive italian restaurant good food but slow an not accurate service for what you pay wine is very expensive in my opinion you can find teens of places where you can enjoy same good food at a fraction of price with a much better service, the place the food the service are outstanding it is a must in shanghai everything is fresh amd delicious, pasta great steak great nice staff and delicious food totally satisfied strong recommend this italian restaurant, we ordered the calamari and oysters as appetizers and they were good but when they brought out my filet it was undercooked i asked them to take it back and cook it for a couple more minutes which they did but when they brought back it still was not quite there the quality of the cut also wasnt fantastic the side dishes we got were all good just too bad they didnt nail the main course

they play their music a little loud and you can seehear the kitchen so theres a lot going on if you want a quiet place this probably isnt the spot for youthat being said its not overly noisy and could be fun for a bigger group, outstanding service with an awesome steak
we went for a business dinner and enjoyed a perfect evening
with outstanding personal attention of the bar manager giorgio who helped us choosing the right wine for the ocassion
the perfect enviroment to endulge the sibarita way of life making us leave shanghai looking forward to return, shanghai spoils you with good food capo is my favorite italian restaurant in town
marco is the best chef you can find in shanghai his cuisine is truly italian made with love made by someone who puts his heart in every dish he serves
i recommend you the homemade garganelli with bolognese sauce the fiorentina and lemon sorbet and you will just be looking forward for the next time to come back to capo to taste marcos scrumptious dishes, i have been to capo on several ocations each time the food is amazing and the service is outstanding
i was their this evening celebrating valentines with my wife for some reason we had a two issues with our meal
no need to get into the exactly what happened but the reason i am mentioning this is that the way in how these issues were addressed everyone from giorgio the bar manager johnson the restaurant manager to aaron gue the managing director handled these issues with our meals with such concern and with the upmost professionalism

when issues arise in any business its the way they are addressed in our case they were handeled is such a proffecional manner that will keep me as a loyal customer they went out of their way to try their best to correct the problems and to do whatever they could to make our evening regardless of what happened an enjoyable one

i would like to thank aaron and his whole team for going out of their way to still make this a very enjoyable and memorable valentines for both my wife and i

once again the food is amazing and the service even better


ps aaron i will be back soon to try the pasta, if it wasnt for a little incident caused by
meat juice dropped by a waiter over the ladys sweater and shirt i would have assigned full points
food was excellent giorgio was capable of handling an aggressive and angry lady
all and all ok, we where there last friday 1311 reservation went perfect reception was great 
food was fantastic nice trainee from paris france beveragemanager was a pro

what a fine host mr aaron guo he even knew us by name this is seldom
i will not tell you what we ate expirience yourself
thank you for having us till next time

mr willy
wiel heijnen netherlands, an excellent choice if you are looking for good quality western food high quality meat including wagyu beef super pizzas my wife said hers was the best one she had eaten and for the food and decor reasonable prices, this was one of our favourite restaurants but we have left a little disappointed after the last two visits

service was good this time as always and the junior waitstaff in white shirts were courteous friendly and efficient

but the food was hitandmiss i had oysters for my starter while my wife had prosciutto melon and mozzarella the oysters were quite nice but on the small side the prosciutto and cheese was fresh though nothing remarkable

we both went for the seafood risotto and enjoyed the dish the two clams were tasty though i did not see much of other seafood in mine and did find the little cucumber bits a little odd but overall the dish was good

the australian striploin just had too much gristle and was very tough it was even hard to cut with the metal knife in fact the lady at the neighbouring table complained to the staff that she was getting tired of slicing the meat and requested that they cut the meat into pieces for her my wife virtually left half the beef on her plate as it was tough and also unchewable

dessert was okay and we enjoyed the ice cream the cinnamon filled croissants were strange though  oily hard and tasted weird

we were there for the early sitting and even though there were a lot of seats around customers were seated at tables within close proximity to each other which did not add to the ambience as noise levels started to rise quickly even when the wifi showed that we were hooked up the phones stated that there was no internet available

overall its a great restaurant and as i said before one of our favourites but it seems to have lost some of its gloss recently, very slow service this time i went to capo it took 40 minutes to get a tuna carpaccio 
pizza was ok but nothing worth to be paid 128 rmb you can get a better pizza for 68 rmb in shanghai the overall experience was not as good as last time and i will not going back, this is one of our favourite italian restaurants being a nice location for an intimate dinner though it can get noisy when a big group is seated nearby while the service was still excellent the food at dinner was not as good as before we went for their special promotion of 588 rmb for two

we started with argentine sweet red shrimp in a cold tomato soup as well as a french oyster on red beet cream both were refreshing though the shrimp was a little soft the oysters were great even though i found a grain of sandshell on mine this was followed by two pasta dishes  spaghetti with zucchini in a cream sauce and risotto with seafood we both enjoyed the spaghetti but not the risotto though the seafood was tasty

our main course was ovengrilled australian strip loin on our last visit we had a similar dish and it was fabulous this time round however the meat was too fatty and chewy and had lots of gristle so much so that my wife and i left almost half untouched on the plate

dessert was almond parfait with blueberries and a caramel sauce i loved the caramel but we felt the almond made the parfait too grainy and heavy

they have a special deal where selected cocktails are halfpriced before 8 pm and we selected a lychee martini and a peach bellini which was made with prosecco while the bellini was okay it was too sweet the lychee martini was disappointing though and tasted just of lychee syrup probably mostly from out of a bottle

i enjoy bread and the bread served was the most delicious item that evening being crusty and tasty and went well with the baked garlic and olive oil, food was just average and very expensive i was told that this was an excellent italian restaurant so needless to say i was very disappointed in both the quality of the food and the price, best italian food in town
der beste italiener auf beiden seiten des huangpu wie in neapel oder rom
i have been in many places here for authentic italian food or what they think it is nothing beats this restaurant
einfach nur gut, great location and good food especially meat service is good and overall experience is fine the only big problem is the price you pay that is unbelievable expensive even if compared with other luxury restaurant in shanghai you really feel a little cheated about wine and food prices, a very nice italia restaurant nice dark location
food quality is very good
service is good
maybe price a bit high for what it is, i went to capo in july 2014 to celebrate with friends i had already been to another restaurant of the same chef and capo came highly recommended service was definitely excellent and food great too though overpriced in my opinion the location is great but we were given a table in a dark and small area not very happy nevertheless if you are looking for a great italian meal in shanghai this is the place to go, its been a while since we had dinner here and i must say the food is very good the ambience and service are excellent though it is still a little on the dark side

the deconstructed bruschetta tasted wonderful  we especially liked the homemade ricotta with black truffle which was excellent with the toasted bread and cold cuts the rolled pizza however was not as good  the pizza wrap was a little too thick and dry

the spaghetti with tartar king prawn was very good i would have liked to have more as it was that good the highlight of the evening was australian striploin which was well cooked well seasoned and had a nice balance between the lean and fat my wife who is not a huge meat fan totally finished her portion

the dessert was well presented and we especially loved the coconut ice cream i had an excellent glass of pinot and it was a generous portion at 58 rmb my wife ordered a limocella but that was not very good in fact it tasted raw and like 80  proof gasoline

overall it was an excellent meal with excellent service the entire meal which we both enjoyed took only 50 minutes as well, we had a large group that took most of the restaurant so it was a preset menu of beef and codfish both dishes were served familystyle and neither were what i would consider italian food which is what we were told to expect at this restaurant

the beef was a little overcooked and sliced thin  roast beef which interestingly enough was listed on the menu card again a preset menu just for us as steak so it wasnt what i expected the fish was good with a white sauce but not a personal favorite of mine

as other have said the lighting was minimal in the restaurant and it was a little noisy the service was good, capo is a very good restaurant near the bund in opposite of peninsula hotel the atmosphere is good and the staff is working hard to make a good service during our last visit the food was excellent and the service good especially a lady from russia and the restaurant manager from nepal are very focused on guests satisfaction the value for money is ok capo is not a cheap place but a nice getaway i looking forward to summer so we can sit outside on the terrace

some wines on the list should be checked  they have some good names back a bad quality especially some wines from italy

we will come back soon and enjoy the stay at capo, we went there for dinner but it has been a big disappointment i have to say probably hard to come back again first of all the environment so dark even cant read the menu and see the food clearly second the food small portion the appetizer the tortelloni with clams good quantity but the clams full of sand  main course nothing special for 300 rmb price
service  we had to wait long time before someone comes to check our table i think in shanghai the service is not the best but when you pay an average of 700 rmb per person you probably expect something more, you pay for the ambience and location right of the bund in an expensive small shopping mall where you have to take an elevator to go to one of the higher floors for the restaurant

love the decor and interior of the restaurant

although the food is good it is definitely on the pricey side but hey what do you expect theyre on a prime location and good european food is generally expensive in an up scale restaurant such as this one

risotto still had some hard grains of rice in it but the overal flavor was great, this was a lovely meal with several highlights service was good and the meal was at a good pace the room itself is on the dark side and grew progressively noisier as more people arrived in the end it was quite difficult to have a conversation at times

i had a glass of prosecco which was slightly tart and very refreshing while my wife had a glass of delectable limoncella prices are not cheap but the quality was good

my wife is allergic to buckwheat and they kindly switched a dish to seafood soup the soup while nice had clams and pieces of fish strangely at least to us it did not have prawns

i started with a delicious plate of handcrafted amalficoast scialatielli pasta with seafood our mains were australian angus beef sirloin  this was done well and tasted fantastic especially with the sea salt

it was the dessert that was slightly a letdown especially when compared to the taste and presentation of the preceding courses it was basically a creme brulee nicely scorched but a little too sweet and what was basically an upsidedown ice cream cone

all in all it was a good meal and we would certainly like to visit the restaurant with some friends to try out the other dishes

the eatery can be hard to find though if you take the lifts in the middle of the yi feng galleria you will end up in muse bar after which you would need to ask your way to capo which is located at the end of a very dark corridor when we left we took the lift from capo and ended up in a back corridor from which we needed to ask our way out to the main shopping area

am reposting this as ta lost around 25 of my reviews which were therefore not published, modern upscale italian cuisine in the bund area i would rate food at this restaurant 710 by north american standards ambience and service 810 presentation 910, the place was hard to find interesting decor but too dark a lot of noisy patrons in such a small space the brag about their slow cooked ribs but earlier in the night the told us we could only order one portion as they did not make enough next we selected one of their several pizzas only to be told they were sold out of all but two i would never go back, this restaurant is located in a high end shopping mal on the four floor the restaurant in cosy the service is very good the plate have very well presentation the decor is simple but nice this restaurant is very quiet witch is nice in a city like shanghai, visited this italian restaurant suggested by friends you have to go through a noisy club before finding the place very dark empty on a friday night excellent beginning its hard to read the menu since there is no light
food mozzarella salad the pizza and the beef fillet were overall good a bottle of chianti water and coffee almost 3000 rmb within 2 people way too expensive for a place like this service overall attentive, excellent food and atmosphere just next to it there is a disco also so you can have dinner and then go for a drink at the disco, i think capo is to dark and noise the food is ok but for what they charge there are better italian place in shanghai, just went there yesterday and i have to say its just perfect  food quality is very good service is on point atmosphere is perfect  really good steaks and good tuna tartar i will come back, i went to capo with a friend and met her first at the bar for a cocktail i was impressed by their cocktail list the drink i had was a bit too sweet but delicious none the less would stick to my classic cocktails if i went back we then took a seat and ordered to start the tuna tartar and the aged ham and melon plate both were great but it took a while to get a glass of wine after that we shared a light pasta that was done impeccably well we could have stopped there but we came for the steak ugh the steak cooked in the apple wood and charcoal ovens visible at the end of the restaurant giving the vibe a cozy real italian feel made my tenderloin steak one of the best steaks i have ever had hands down i would stick to the thicker cuts of meat as my friend got the strip steak which was still tasty but just could not compare my steak was charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare on the inside sealing in all the juices and flavors  which were drawn out even more by the sea salt served with it we got two sides sauteed greens and the potatoes both huge portions served family style for two people would recommenced getting one side but its hard not to get a potatoes and vegetable with steak all in all i think that the quality of food for the price and location is great there is a wide variety of options so you can go crazy or just try a few things and keep it a reasonable fancy dinner have recommended it to friends and while most were wowed with the food have said similar things about the service being a little slow and not 100 on top of their game, on a recent business trip to shanghai i had the opportunity to dine at capo

as locations go this is relatively easy to find as it is on the fifth floor of a very well known building on the bund i asked for the concierge to show me the way and he led me to the side elevator that took me to the restaurant

the restaurant looks very much like an elegant old style club room i had a distinct feel like i was in a variation of mortons

the service is very attentive efficient and unobtrusive the staff are also very well versed with the alternatives and are happy to suggest dishes to suit your palette

i was very tempted by the chicken but regrettably theyd run out of the chicken that night

i then settled for their steak with a marbling of 3 the steak was absolutely delicious it was served with the most crispy and crunchy shoestring fries that ive had in a very long time

my side order of a rocket salad helped me to lessen my sin of eating that much delicious meat

for dessert i went in for the creme brulee which was served beautifully and tasted even better

keep in mind that capo isnt exactly inexpensive by shanghai standards but it makes for a really good option for an elegant dinner, the atmosphere is nice and intimate although the lighting is a little dark for my taste we ordered the set menu which was a great opportunity to try a range of food we started with oysters and sushi which was prepared very well then had a simple tomato mozzarella vinegar dish which was perfect then a little tortellini ravioli dish that was very good we had the wagyu steak which they serve very simply with some delicious crunchy side salt flakes which id never had before and went great with the steak we ordered it medium well and they cooked it very accurately the prosecco was amazing and the house red was delicious the dessert was over the top delicious we had this coconut icecream and fruit with chocolate brownie soufle thing that ended an amazing meal, this italian restaurant uses simple ingredients that are fresh yet creatively done i loved the meat and cheese platter as well as the seafood pasta the portions were generous and the wine kept flowing it was a great night this restaurant works well with parents on a date or with a boss love it, ive been here several times with friends or for work and this is one of the only restaraunts in the area that i look forward going back to living in jingan district of shanghai i more often take my repeat business to places in walking distance but this one is worth going out of my way and i much prefer this end of the bund  rockbund area

a good advantage of capo is that the menu is more flexible than other bund spots you can have a casual night with friends with more of a tapas light bite style or you can get the full course with starting cocktails in other words no requirement for ordering the pricey 3 or 4 course menu as with some other places and not so much price shock on the wine and cocktails just writing this makes me want to go back again this week , had been to another shanghai italian restaurant nearby earlier in the week that felt very pretentious capo offered quality ingredients that were enhanced by the preparation we had pasta to share for the table as an appetizer along with the warm bread then we each had a different kind of fish with baby carrots roast potatoes and broccoli all of which were wonderful we were given complimentary glasses of prosecco servers were very helpful in adapting a dish to meet our dietary restrictions our neighbours shared an immense slab of meat that looked delicious no room for dessert reasonably priced compared to the other restaurant too would definitely recommend capo we had no difficulty finding it thanks to other reviewers directions to walk past the parking attendant go i the door on the left and go up in the elevator, this is a great place in for both business dinners and for a date the atmosphere and style is what you could find in a loft type of place in nyc or london exposed brick clean lines and highend details the bar is relatively small but some great innovative drinks on the menu the food menu is rather large and focuses on pasta and steaks but there are also some fish i had the black cod for main which was superb the only drawback is that somehow the restaurant is connected with a nightclub so when you need the restroom you have to share that with the nightclub crowd in any case i am coming back for drinks for dinner  whatever but im definitely heading back to capo, having tried a string of disappointing italian restaurants in shanghai we decided to splash out on something more upscale and so headed bundside to visit capo a place recommended by an italian friend located in the impressive rockbund development it becomes apparent from the moment that you walk in you are about to have a memorable dining experience from the lowkey mood lighting to the tasteful italian decor it is obvious thought has been put into the environment as well as the food capo is not a small restaurant but the way it is set out in a long narrow room gives it a cosy intimacy and other people�s conversations are never intrusive

as we were deciding what to eat from the rather large menu we were brought crisp warm fresh bread with oil and balsamic but i was delighted to see what accompanied it � rock salt and a whole roasted garlic now i am a huge fan of garlic and probably keep garlic farmers in business with the amount i consume so for me this was sublime garlicky goodness i must have asked for 3 more during the course of the meal and the staff were only too happy to oblige

after consuming my body weight in garlic we decided to order a couple of capo�s specials firstly the burrata � which turned out to be a soft buttery concoction of mozzarella and cream which still has me dreaming about it then their signature dish the fiorentina steak

now i had never heard of this cut of beef before and when we asked we were told it wasn�t available elsewhere in shanghai because the owner has a share in the australian wagyu beef farm that this cut is from we were also told about the cow�s long and impressive blood line and all i can say is you could tell this was an animal of breeding in every tender creamy fatmarbled bite that melted in your mouth

we went for a couple of pasta dishes to round out our meal now having traveled pretty much all over italy i�ve eaten a lot of pasta and these hit the spot the pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauces had the fresh taste of a small italian kitchen

the service was also impeccable � the waiting staff were attentive but unobtrusive and seemed to give me what i wanted before i even knew i wanted it

all in all capo is not one of the cheaper italian restaurants in town but you�re paying for the quality of food and carefully sourced ingredients if you don�t mind paying a little extra for a superior experience then i would say capo is for you, shanghai has a lot of great restaurants from all around the world capo restaurant was one of the best dining experiences i have had in this city to date as a regular diner my italian palate isshallow when a couple of friends invited me to this restaurant all i wanted was maybe some spaghetti garlic bread and a decent setting this restaurant overdelivered and did it well the restaurant is a little hard to find however walking in you know its the right place intimate but comfortable dining decor and lighting perfect for a date or a chill night with friends the menu provides a nice setup from the antipasti dishes to the mains and if you have any room for dessert which we did not and looking at the other dessert tables it was our lost you can achieve a full dining experience we started with a great tuna tartar and fresh baked bread with roasted garlic bulbs with oil vinegar and rock salt delicious we didnt fill up on the bread as we shared two great pasta dishes not spaghetti buratta salad with fresh arugula and duck proscuitto our main dish the first and signature dish of mains was a bit expensive but well shared between my friends and i with plenty of delicious sides like roasted potatoes and seasoned and grilled vegetables everything tasted so good and we had a good time to boot the staff is very friendly and attentive but not too intrusive i plan to go back and make my way through the entire menu as i am sure everything will be just as delicious happy dining, the steak in capo is really nice its worthy to give it a try love their dessert served in le creuset very cute, this place was a little hard to find  go in the driveway past the car park guy and theres a door on the left with an elevator anyway met a friend for dinner back in october and weve been back once a month since the food is excellent  great steaks nice homemade pastas oh and the burrata is to die for anup the bartender makes the best drinks and has made me every drink on the menu that now he just makes them up the owner enzo is very friendly and always stops by our table for a chat the only downside is the bathroom is shared with the club next door but at least its a large bathroom so youre not stuck waiting in line outdoor seating isnt in use yet , we have been fans of enzo carbone since he opened the kitchen when we first moved to shanghai in 2005 capo takes his cooking to another level while maintaining a comfortable family atmosophere

his crudo plates can be very good sometimes the simpler plates scallops oysters outshine the more complicated presentations but the overall seafood quality is very high capos pasta and risotto dishes are very strong and we have had great experiences with his grilled beef and fish entrees

the wine list is a major improvement over the kitchen with some very good and reasonably priced for shanghai which is very expensive for wine selections not easily found in other restaurants

there are several small private dining areas which seat between 4 and 30 people depending on the configuration this is one of our reliable event restaurants for hosting groups in shanghai, there was certainly plenty of activity around the bund last night and plenty of restaurants to spend your money in offering expensive christmas eve set meal packages we chose capo since we had found it recently while exploring the shopping mall tucked away behind muse the nightclub the design and atmosphere calls out for christmas time and the winter holidays good drinks at the bar big but expensive wine list tic but enjoyed our 2 selections wonderful service from several well trained staff and hospitable managers working the room well the chefs menu was superb and creative using one brown paper bag for the first course loved all the dishes and we were able to share each course as we could select one of each will be back, great restaurant in the loft right opposite the peninsula hotel but hidden away on the 5th floor of a loftthey had an extensive selection of wines and cocktails great atmosphere with good food and appetizershowever the service was slow for some reason but that would not stop me from going back again the spring chicken was perfectly cooked, to be honest i hadnt heard that much about capo  and man is it hard to find you get in a lift you then get out in a club you try and find the door  you go back down again through another corridor finally find the right lift and then boom i was really surprised looked nothing like i thought it would  its almost like a cave in there with beautiful wood floors and cool bare bulbs of light hanging from the ceiling

so its an italian but with a big focus on steaks in their wood oven well we started me and the wife that is with their crudo bar of oysters shrimps and the lot great start all super fresh and juicy wife was happy  the night was goingt o go well

i followed up with a steak one of the suggested apple wood smoked ones from australia  super juicy and perfectly cooked sided up with bone marrow  that the wife again was all over

the manager with his slick hair looked like he was trying to be some kind of mafia dude but was super nice and offered a load of help with the ordering on the wine especially

so youll drop a fair bit of cash  its not cheap but lacks that pretense that you sometimes get in shanghai and was a real treat recommended all round for some serious food in a really surprise environment, we took the promotion menu when i went there with my wife amazing appertizers especially for the arugula salad with cheese tuna tartar as well tortinilli was ok but beyond my expectation steak was a little bit disappoint cause it was over cooked but generally the food was good service was smooth and friendly but worse than that which i got during my last review in jing an shangrila, my husband and our friends love this restaurant we travel to shanghai several times a year on business and for leisure and make sure we visit capos on every visit the service is always exceptional the atmosphere is modern chic and warm and the food has always been exceptional the ingredients are fresh with the refined clean tastes of the italian food you would get if visiting italy with a modern twist if you are looking for heavy pasta dishes this is not your place rather the dishes are a lighter fare thoughtfully created and perfectly prepared, went there with 10 friends and we had a private room whose design was really nice globally an effort has been made in term of architecture and design in the whole place unfortunately most of us were very disappointed with the foodthat had nothing exceptionnal especially the tomato sauce pasta that we could easily have done ourself at home risotto though was nice but lot of dishes were unavailble so choice was limited there is a very nice terrasse but why is it hidden in a corridor and not having any table  service was friendly and nice but foodwise it wasnt enough to make me come back ","cafe",0.645334528589397
163,"the location is my favorite former french concessionthe steak is wonderfulthe wine and shot is so golden the service standard is so highi like the restaurant, my friend and i came here because this restaurant was recommended by fellow midwesterners in fact we heard that the owner was from wisconsin and had to say hi and see what he was doing in shanghai
very casual bar and restaurant with good food and good music the service was great would like to go back when the weather is nice and sit outside, a nice pub where not only germans meet there is a beergarden for the summer time they have a good choice of beers at acceptable prices and a good variety of continental meals the service is friendly, as i live close to shanghai i like to go to the abbey road
nice beer garden food and friendly and english speaking staff
worth to go there anytime, this is a very nice place that i can and will recommend to anyone staying in shanghai
the food is very good the staff is very nice and they also speak fluent english also they are very alert and always there when you need something
the unique ambience adds to the charme of the whole place will definitely go there again and bring friends and family that are in shanghai on holiday and miss good european food, the staff  best you will find in shanghai speak both chinese and english and clearly know  from the owner and senior managers how to be polite and friendly with people of all countries

great food and quality drinks  amazing happy hour in a beautiful location in shanghai  always my default choice, we went to abbey road for lunch and we find ourselves in a very stylish restaurant decorated with the beatles posters the lunch set menu was very good and the price was very good too a very good place for true beatles fans, when come to this neighborhood we fall in small european architecture place with shadows from the sycamores in heart of this place among another restaurants located current restaurant menu is european i cant say it is only french swiss or english it is just european big enough choice of food and drinks ordered beefstroganov which was excellent and some starters which also were good service has been made in very good english the service was excellent i saw a lot european tourists speaking in many languages and looks for me not only me liked the service
if you are in shanghai and you still looking the good european food and atmosphere  this a place in comparison with other shanghai european restaurants it is really not expensive and a portions are not small, we had brunch here but i think theyre better known for their drinks we read a review that they had a good brunch set it is definitely overpriced and mediocre at best, if you need a break from asian food and a beer for a night and not empty your pockets too much then its a great place
food is simple but cheap and large portions and everynight a different meal deal the beer garden is great on a summers night, a very pleasant beatlethemed bar and restaurant with a swissoriented menu service is friendly without being intrusive, food is just okay here but the happy hour is pretty good theres also a large area for outdoor seating on a nice day its an easy place to hang out in with friends its also in a good location walkable distance from everywhere else i frequent in shanghai, great european food a true mix of foods from swiss rosti goulasch soup german sausages they even had cheese fondue i would recommend to anyone so much choice it took us a while
they also have a happy hour
well made food and large portion size

it was only the decoration style that gave it a 4

give it a try, we had a few drinks here on wednesday night to celebrate our engagement and stopped here primarily because the garden looked so inviting
it was a warm night and we saw that they had mood lighting and white flowers in the garden and the music could easily be heard
we were able to connect easily to their wifi and we were served quickly after being seated
i had a lychee mojito and it was amazing i would love to go back in the day to see what the atmosphere is like then
lovely staff very friendly great ambience in the garden, you cant really go wrong here the site is lovely with one of the most pleasantly green al fresco spaces in shanghai for a relaxed meal or drinks watch out for evenings though as for some reason the mosquitoes love it here as well very friendly staff swiss western food fusion in good portions good happy hour very affordable no fireworks on the beer wine and cocktails list but good staples easy access with plenty of taxis and good music with pop and rock classics def will be back if in town, every time i am in shanghai abbey road needs to be visited reasonable prices for good quality stuff go there and enjoy the french quarter, abbey road has a great outside area and an excellent atmosphere the staff are brilliant and the food is excellent contrary to what you might assume by the name the food is german style and one of the best examples of such food in the city, nice place with different kind of spaces and a bar try the delicious abbeyroad 300g steak with french fries
as local potatoes are different the consistency of berner rostis is not ok but there are plenty other good meals, been to this place at least three times and had a good time each time place is good for food as well as drinks depending what time you go there staff are mostly chinese but very friendly and they understand english, this is our pub before and after diner i just love the cocktail come together not sweet but salty and sour, good burgers nice crowd on happy hours and weekends very close to other nightlife spots best to go with a group of friends let it flow, perfect place for a nice dinner or some drinks the daily special is often very hearty inexpensive and tasty very nice and service minded staff most of the staff speaks and understand english quite well been there +10 times over the years and have never been dissapointed i will most likely go back there again, i went to their new location after quite some time my wife and i just ordered food and no beer or wine

she ordered a cordon bleu schnitzel which was more of a joke it is square shaped and thick as two layers of toast bread the meat inside is about 1 cm thick so no pounding there

my berner rosti was rather over greasy potato mash which probably sits in the kitchen for quite some time before it enters the final cooking stage

final verdict if you are looking for comfort food look somewhere else

waiters are very nice and smiling which is still rare in shanghai, i spent a lovely couple of hours at abbey road having drinks and appetizers the wine was great and with happy hour prices very affordable i had the sliders and they were very good the atmosphere and the service were outstanding the patio is divine but can be a bit chilly during the winter you will love this place, i been here a few times and it seems fairly good i am always amazed at a few things the fluent english that the waiting staff speak the size of the place cos it looks small from the outside and the fact it serves warsteiner on draught that alone makes it worth going to they even serve it in branded glasses also there isnt music blasting out from every corner even though it is obviously a music bar, it is not only the natural friendly staff which attracts us frequently but as well the happy hour where you pay as less as 25 rmb for nice red wine white wine and beer every week day from monday to friday they got a special offer for dinner for just 55 rmb western food in good quality from burger to swiss roesti not to forget that we often lunch here for 75 rmb getting a soup a main course and a drink  monday to friday the atmosphere is relaxed in the background you will listen to a tasteful mix of music from 60th to nowadays it is easy to come together like the beatles did, visited saturday evening when the ausnz rugby was on and the first game of the epl at the same time the filipina managersupervisor he juggled the different needs of patrons really wellefficiently and ensured both rugby and football fans sawheard what they wanted

one side is a bar ambiance with 4 tvs and the other is a small bar and more of a restaurant scenariosetting

good selection of drinks including draught guinness goodsolid bar menu and whilst our children only had burgers there still good quality and well portioned

first time visitors and pleasantly surprised  would be a good bar to watch sports without the loutish behaviour seen in many sports bars, while looking for a sports bar to watch the all blacks vs wallabies match we accidentally stumbled across abbey road and decided to stay i can honestly say it was the best decision you get to watch your sport in a nice relaxing atmosphere and enjoy drinks good food  wonderful service i highly recommend it o, great place for food and drink at good price  the staff are great and helpful i would tell most visitors who are on a budget to eat and drink here outdoor tables are good when not to hot, if you are desperately looking for western food and do not want to spend much money go to abbey road the outside terrace is nice and covered in case of rain the menu has an excellent choice of swiss yes swiss dishes i especially like the roesties, liked the free mozzy spray on the outdoor tables you know you wont be dining alone so this came in handy, came here a couple of times would certainly recommend this place for brunch very popular with the expat community with its very european style menu and outdoor space dog friendly great service just passed by the place last week and apparently they have recently moved across the street so keep a look out for the change of address, abbey road is well situated to give you some space n peace from shanghais busy streets popular place for drinks n brunch too has both indoor  outdoor areas, love coming here at weekends and sitting outside making the most of their all day happy hour the staff are all really friendly and efficient there is a very good drinks selection and the food ive had there is always good i especially like the schnitzel strips and sausage platter you are able to book tables which is a good idea if going as part of a group, we visited abbey road for brunch on a saturday morning in october the outdoor seating was very beautiful and quaint there are trees that grow through the building and right next to the outdoor seating and the road traffic noise did not bother us
we ordered 2 omelets one was the greek omelet with feta cheese and peppers the other was the salmon omelet with salmon cheese and olives it came with our choice of fruit or museli we also ordered coffee the order totaled around 280 rmb and we were full after the meal we both thought the food was good but not enough to say that we would order it again
overall it was a great atmosphere to sit for awhile and watch the world go by especially on an autumn day, a lovely place in the french concession where all the action is inside seating is available but much better to sit outside in the lovely tree lined courtyard at the side wise to book a table in the summer the happy hour runs from 48 weekdays with heineken 35rmb and tiger 30rmb which is pretty standard for shanghai after that prices go up to the usual unreasonable more expensive than home shanghai rip offs the best bet is to go for the frozen margaritas and daiquiris that come in different flavours and are 30rmb before 8 i havent sampled much of the menu but we go for the daily 50rmb deals  their schnitzel is large and good rosti is perhaps the best especially with a fried egg on top and the burgers are slightly smaller then at shanghai brewery but very tasty its a great after work place to go for drinks and dinner, this is a swiss barrestaurant its nice environment and has a nice atmosphere its nice to sit outside during summer and its always very full also on week days better to make reservation
if you like swiss or german food this is for you they serve some pasta which they are far away to the real pasta and they serve some sandwich which are very good

most of people go here for drinks aperitif time and have some snack before going to have dinner in some places around abbey road, not to full of people and good western food interesting different actions every night with a garden, i often go to abbey road on a tuesday for their snitzel special

for the price you pay and what you get its really not that bad i also love their spatzle which is an egg and flour based pasta their food is always served really hot

the service is pretty good and waitresses are always smiling

it is also a good place to chat and mingle with friends

i am looking forward to the summer time to sit outside, ive been at abbey road on friday evening the place is fine especially in summer time but has few major issues it is incredibly noisy there is not sufficient ventilation food comes different than order having a conversation is difficult, i live in a beach community in so california i spend a lot of time traveling this is probably my favorite place to unwind after a hectic day good food and drinks and great people to spend the evening with, this place really isnt a beatlesthemed bar despite the name we had a great happy hour here with wine priced at around $4usd a glass and some delicious comfort food the place has a very friendly staff and seems very popular with expats as a tourist its a good place to go when you need a break from chinese food and just want to dig into a burger some fries and a margarita the antipasti plate was a nice snack but was pretty small so id probably steer clear of that if i went back the patio is very large and is a great place to wind the night away, nice place but not what you would expect a beatles bar to be upmarket and swanky they refused to play any beatles songs when i asked too, good bar  restaurant in the french concession area located at the top of yueyang rd near the junction with dongping rd outdoor seating available
seems to be a very popular venue with expats
daily happy hour mon  fri 4pm  7pm and at weekends happy hour 10 am  7pm can get a draft tiger beer at happy hour for 20 rmb and house white wine for 25 rmb
we came back a second time for drinks  food
recommended, ive always enjoyed going to this restaurant the food and service are great they have a good selection of western food with deals on different nights of the week they also have happy hour so if you go there early evening you can take advantage of this too there is a nice outdoor area and good music the staff are very friendly and attentive management in particular go the extra mile to make you feel welcome i highly recommend this place, very nice and cozy restaurant with patio dining area extremely friendly staff very reasonable prices good quality and good variation of western food, been there for brunch with friends last saturday and just loved it
perfect for a relaxing weekend meal outside seating and nice service make it one of my favorite spots in the area portions were big especially cordon blue one and service was prompt
worried about seating outside and been eaten by mosquitos no worries theyve got off on each table
playlist a huge plus, this review has been a long time in the writing largely due to my laziness we have had another amazing meal at abbey road shanghai the service is amazing always so hospitable and forthcoming
try all of the meals here never fails to disappoint my husband and i have been regularly for over a year now so have tried many options and all have been great
once again thanks to the staff especially spring and daisy who always make things so easy for us
well done guys, abbey road is without a doubt my favourite restaurantbar in shanghai as the service of this establishment is great if youre a local there like myself youll be greeted by the manager noel and served by some great staff one in particular would have to be james a chinese bloke from jiangsu province who has the heaviest cockney accent for someone who speaks english as a second language

although these days i have one problem im beginning to wonder where all of the usual staff are until i was told by kitty usual worker that they had moved all of their original staff to the new restaurant in hongqiao yet this wont stop me from coming back as the service is still good and i received a 10 meal get 1 free card

the food is great the ambiance is great  i would recommend it to anyone who wants to relax have dinner  drinks


they also have a happy hour every day from 4 to 7pm, we had brunch today friendly greeting by hostess prompt attention from server food came out quickly and we enjoyed it all this is not a large place seating a few dozen people four beer choices on tap we both had rosti  one vegetarian version and one berner version both were large enough that we brought home half of them the manager aaron stopped by as we got up to leave to make sure we were happy we will return to try some of their other pastas and schnitzles i wish we had known of this spot before 210 rmb for a large beer coke two rostis that came with salads","Chinese cuisine",0.999813487756416
164,"this restaurant and bar has been a well known place for years now and it still proves its todays style and value starting with the entrance which is fun to find out how to open the door but even more fun to go to the restrooms which could be a challenge if you are desperate all in all its a cool place to go

we went there for a lunch set menu price is reasonable food amount could be more though the food tastes great so you better ask for a reservation in advance even during lunch time the restaurant is pretty busy we have to go back in the evening to sit in the lounge area and test the bar with its astonishing variety of drinks thumps up, unique venuesetting the food is not the best but well worth a visit i love the whole concept though its fun cool drinks, a really cool bar thats hard to find we bumped into it almost by accident the bar can provide you with great drinks and nice athmosphere but the light coded secret entrance makes this place even more memorable call the bar to get todays code, its an awesome concept restaurant first we needed to enter a passcode to enter the restaurant which entails putting your hand into holes shaped like a telephone pad to press the position of the number password of the day the restaurant serves chinese fusion food which is pretty different we ordered 2 daily menus which include 2 dishes each
menu1 deepfried spicy sliced chiken  panfried beed cubes with peppers
menu2 boiled mushroom cuttlefish without lettuce  spare ribs in plum sauce

the winner was boiled mushroom but everything was pretty good

menu costs 58person and includes soup risa green salad and tea or coffee

bathrooms are a must go placepretty original, the entrance code is a quirk of this restaurant  as is finding it only people who know its there are going as its not a roadside frontage or drop in
its quite dark inside but a good atmosphere the bar is interesting but we werent keen on the cocktails dont go there for wine  beers and for some cocktails are the drinks to have

food was good tasty and easy to share it was also authentic  dont go here expecting to be able to converse in english i dont say that as a negative  it is part of the fact it is not there to pander to expats or tourists, its a concept restaurant and pretty fancy first we needed to enter a passcode to enter the restaurant which entails putting your hand into holes shaped like a telephone pad to press the position of the number password of the day the restaurant serves chinese fusion food so the food is pretty different not sure what to compare to but definitely yummy we ordered a dish named super long vegetable and fruit roll just because of the dish name and hmm yes its a super long vegetable and fruit roll and yummy too haha

also if you are chinese and like your word puzzles the table top is full of them and you can spend your time solving them with your friends while waiting for the food

last thing a must to check out their toilets no im not going to give away the spoiler, really cool place the whole place is designed as a riddle and how to get in is the first obstacle they serve great drinks in a dark quiet atmosphere so its great if you go with someone you want to chat with and dont want to be disturbed by the music or other guests, from outside you dont even know that there is s restaurantno name concrete stairs with 9 illuminated holes you need to book and get a code which you will need to enter by yourself to open the door once you are inside you find a 3 story restaurant with a large bar on the second floor if you get a table on the top floor you will sit under a veranda and get a nice view pretty dark in the restaurant to create the atmosphere i guess menu is kind of chinese tapas  no large portion the food is actually not so interesting some dishes are good like the fried shrimp but some are pretty tasteless like the tong and its tomato sauceyou dont go there for the food for sure funny concept from the entrance to the toilets doors medium price service ok, good luck getting in literally if you can figure out the door then youre more than halfway there dress well but its relaxed great interior venue and the drinks are spot on

worth hitting around 10pm on weekends, difficult to find entrance has only a small light on the floor with people 7 written on it and you can enter by using a code after you have reserved its in a former plant of something postindustrial design and cosy tables food is really good service is perfect and you also have a nice bar on the groundfloor where you can have drinks and smoke we went there twice both for dinner and lunch and we were very much satisfied by food and people around us and the staff a must go the atmosphere is unique, one of the best places to feel sudden unexpected contrast to crazy shanghai streets interior is simply stunning facing small bamboo forest wall really simple and special cocktails at the same time
food is somewhat unique and sometimes not westerntastefriendly you see and feel the quality and traditions in those dishes though many of them are too extreme for western taste buds you either fall in love with that type of menu or try to avoid it

though the interior the emotion that is created is stunning and keeps you coming back, i went with a group of people

at the beginning you will be impressed by the focus on unique design of the place i am not willing to say that it is gimmicky but it definitely aims to impress my group agrees that it would impress a date to go to this restaurant


for the food the only thing that i care about it is very average if i dont think about the price if i include price into the eqution i would say it is below average it took forever to get all the food i would say the ingredients were high quality but the addition of ingredients were not satisfying something always seems to be missing, ot may be still is some waiters could be nicer some not more arrogant
lunch menu was good the place fully crowded
the concept wanta to surprise which is ok for once but not enough to develop substance, i chose this to meet a friend for the first time it has a romantic environment for that kind of date food is in good layout, very interesting interior design with matching dishes and drinks mixing western and asian culture and cuisine the experience already started at the door where you need a code to get in the food is a mix of standard asian and western dishes with also some fusion dishes all presented in a creative way drinking their sake coctails at the very long concrete bar is quite an experience well designed plates and cutleries be sure to check out the toilet and take note that the dining area is very dimmly lit, just by chance we came across this restaurant looking up for a random place to eat in it was just awesome the interiors are the wet dreams of every architect and the food those of every foodie the paltes have artistic puzzle to solve there is password o get in  i dont actually remember this but as i dont speak chinese i wasnt the one talking to the waiter and receptionist 
amazing food amazing drink and all in all a quirky wonderful experience, no one will ever notice that there is a restaurant there no indication and no sign outside
on top of that you need a password to get in

the interior is as surprising as the outside especially if you go when its dark outside

the food is really excellent served in small portion but with a wonderful taste

the thing to do in that place is definitively to go to the bathrooms  try it and you will understand why, i will not ruin the surprises for those who havent been but from the entrance you need a code to key into the wall to the rest rooms to the amazing deco to the reasonably priced food fushion food  comparative to restaurants in the former french concession this is highly recommended beware though there is no sign of the restaurant so looking for it might be a challenge

nice bar too

ask for a table on the top floor glass roof failing which ask for a table with the bamboo garden view if you dont get tables around these 2 areas then your experience will be a very different one i had been to this restaurant many times and had dined in different part of the restaurant, ok you make a reservation you get a number and first you have to finde the restaurant not too difficult just go up the stars at no 805 no sign of the restaurant 9 boxes to enter your number from 123  456  789 top to bottom doors will open and you are in atmosphere is dark and relative ok this is where the adventure ends food is good but you will get better in shanghai service not great as you have to ask to be served or to get a new drink overaal the fun is before you have your dinner and not during dinner move on to the next one just tick the box done it seen it did it, a great little place for an interesting lunch as stated before there is a trick to getting in firstly the doorway is a nondescript stairway with 9 circular lights at the top and a sliding metal door if you dont know the trick hidden switch or something then youll do what we did which is to look very uncool and tailgate someone who is

once inside youll find yourself in a 3 storey colonial building very spacious with creaky carpet covered floorboards the menu is available in english we ordered the set lunch for 2 plus a beer each and it came to under <u+00a5>200

each dish is presented with flair and the wait staff are like sulky hipsters but that sort of adds to the feel a trip to the bathroom is also recommended

highly recommended for the fun factor, very nice the long bar with the mirror you can drink on the bar meeting people or find intimacy table and nice view on bamboo lighted dinner chinese but in western review you can invite friends or become a informal business meeting, enjoyed dinner here in april 2013 visit it was a little hard to find but a comfortable setting nice crowd and the food was very good enjoyed some nice wines by the glass also would go there again, we found this restaurant whimsical and amusing starting with the entry there was no sign outside the entry was up a set of stairs with nine cylindrical lights the restaurant gives you the pin number for that evening when you make reservations and pushing in the appropriate lights lets you in the food was varied and interesting, often go here for a dinner because fooddrinks and specially the ambiance is so great you can order if with 2 persons easily 4 different dishes and share the food tried many and never had a bad one desserts are good as well also great as start of the evening as they have a chill out area for a drink and a great bar, good taiwanesse restaurant good service and variaty of food great section of the city right in julu rd, as an overall experience its worth going to the hidden door and overall uber cool interior is worth seeing food unfortunately is pretty average they seem to be trying so hard to be cutting edge but they havent put that much effort into the food great for a drink but wouldnt eat there again, people 7 is hard to find it was funny trying to go into people 7 thats all i will say about the entrance the decor is minimal like shintori null li restaurant we went for an after dinner drink it was quite full but we were lucky that a table left when we arrived the drinks were pretty good mostly chinese customers there, it took us about 3 months to figure out that this place was even a restaurant the exclusive front door makes it a place that you dont just stumble upon it was worth our perseverance the door opens to a buzz of people sitting in a beautiful lounge enjoying a drink overlooking a bamboo garden the food is great the portions are small though we have returned a number of times and never been disappointed, good value for money especially the lunch set menu quality of food is consistent however the place does need some upgrading new coat of paint change the carpet etc overall place has a very tired look hostess should be friendly and helpful although service staff was good and fast with ordering, fusion asian food and modern deco attracts yound crowds the entrance and bathroom are interesting, we were stopped in the elevator of our hotel by a fellow traveler who told us we absolutely must check out people 7 and i hope that others will have just as good of an experience as we did the entrance has a code you have to stick our arm into one of the 9 or 10 holes and the door mysteriously opens one of the other guests showed us after we stood at the entrance for a few moments the place is very dark which creates a very intimate atmosphere the bar is very happening and the food is just amazing not to mention the impeccable asian service after dinner we walked a few blocks to bar 88 and danced the night away making it a very special and exciting first day in shanghai","Italian cuisine",0.999806009147824
165,"totally enjoyed the dinner as it was last minute decision heard good things about it as it earned a michelin star my fav dishes were the deep fried beancurd with urchin sauce and the lions head with sweet sauce it was a delight and wonderfully cooked, we went for dinner and had the seasonal dishes all fresh in season ingredients produce and tastely cooked special thanks to a waiter who helps us a lot with his knowledgeable food recommendation , had dining a la carte and tested a few chef signature dishes great food well presented with friendly efficient staff in a relaxed setting definitely a visit again location, this place is quite exciting for me because its all my childhood dishes done extremely well the flavours are immensely delicate with just the slightest deviation from the original to showcase creativity, i had an amazing seven course dinner here  three courses were crab based  and all three were amazing  cant go wrong with the male or female hairy crab , my hairy crab night as my first dinner in shanghai this trip ordered one male crab and female crab as well as abalone and steamed fish theyre all good, we dined out at a few of the more formal restaurants in shanghai but this was the best by far from walking in we had the menu explained to us with a walk through the local specialities we opted for sweet and sour pork the famous pork dumplings crispy duck stir fried fried rice with wagyu beef and spring onions and sweet peas

we were brought an appetiser of dragon fruit in small pieces in soy sauce with a noodle and some sweet nuts in sesame seeds also a complimentary dish of crispy fish in what tasted like a plum sauce

my only sadness was that we couldnt finish all our food the fried rice dish with beef was the best i have ever tasted and the dumplings fantastic we had some mango ice cream for pudding and a shanghai speciality of glutinous rice pearls

the service was exemplary the food was all totally delicious it was a very very special experience and i wouldnt hesitate to come back for a special occasion, my daughter and i stayed at mandarin oriental for 4 nights we had spring rolls rice xiao long bao fresh squeezed watermelon juice and a mighty tasty dirty martini for my cocktail the food quality was excellent and the staff was very attentive only thing that disappointed my daughter was that she forgot her black cap on the dining seat and when we returned next morning to hopefully find it the staff said no one returned it, went there for lunch was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the dishes not inexpensive but felt it was worth the price clearly high quality ingredients fantastic service, i waited almost two weeks before writing this critique of this dinning room because i enjoyed this hotel so musch we were there for six days to learn about and emerse ourselves in the exploding art scene in chinas biggest city we viewed the hotel as a luxurious respite from city life we ate in the hotel or our room several times always with great services and good food we ate at yong yi tang in the oriental dinner one night we each had one entree beef and chicken one soup for her and one glass of wine each our bill was $27300 us each glass of wine as $30+ and the entree say 6070$ im not complaining about the price or the service to the table or the quality of the food  good but not memorable ienot to die for what the establishment doesnt do well is handle their customers in general the chinese are loud and rude  say in comparison to say tokyo or seattleites pushing in line yelling in public but generally when people around the world go to a high end establishment they put on their best behavior or if they dont the maitre de asks them to refrain not here throughout our 112 dinner a 4 year old was allowed to ride his bicycle schooter around the restruant not just once or twice the parents thought it was fine apparently part of the new money no manners phenomenon that china is dealing with my son is a prince and i can afford the food so watch my son riding and yelling who cares about others or having basic training so ok if you are looking for a family joint where your kids can bring their toys and bikes if your looking for that world class chef and elegant dinning experience in one of asias finest hotels in chinas largest city maybe next year on this one they need to work on the management principles first, this is a very nice place within the mo hotel we went as a group and had the private room at the back  very nice indeed great setting facing a private open kitchen food is quite tasty and service is good, i had such a wonderful experience eating at this restaurant the presentation and the cooking was done perfectly the ambiance of the restaurant was very cozy it was definitely one of the best meals i had in shanghai the waiter was also attentive and helpful the only downside was the price and the lighting of the room which i found
��, had a great lunch there and was blown away by some creative dishes especially the half popped fried rice saw the chef yapping it up with friends sitting after lunch rush so he was cooking that day went there with large group and got one of their fancy rooms with hefty minimum spend and was sorely disappointed not a single
��, nice restaurant very friendly staff food way ok for us to much bones in the chicken pieces difficult to eat without knife and fork also hairy crab was difficult to eat all dishes were tasty there are better restaurants in shanghai, had a fine meal but not special i have eaten at great restaurants around the world and for the price i was not impressed the menu is long and interesting the food was beautiful, extensive menu with authentic flavors and perfectly cooked foods it was quite a treat but also quite expensive i recommend the river fish short ribs and the rice cakes, quality of food is really great and usual big choice of dishes quite expensive though but probably its worth it, we when there for breakfast  international fresh food was well served in a cozy environment  friendly staff with good english standard ~, i had my birthday dinner at yong yi ting in november the food and overall dining experience was exceptional i reserved a private dining room and was able to assemble a wide selection from their main menu everything was well presented and very delicious the highlights of the meal included the crispy wuxi eel hot and sour soup pork pyramid
��, went for the set course meal in this very modern pudong restaurant the restaurant was only half full a great
��, my husband and i stayed at the mo shanghai for my birthday weekend and we dined at yong yi ting i must say i enjoyed the meal a lot and would definitely go back again i loved the food and the decor of the restaurant the waiters were all very helpful and offered me a shawl when the ac was turned on quite high

the price isnt cheap though but i can tell that the chef put a lot of heart into the cooking, good choice of chinese cuisine in very pleasant surrounding helpful and curtious staffprompt service, this is easily the best restaurant in a hotel in shanghai the cuisine is beautifully refined the service extremely attentive and the room beautiful dishes such as the dong po pork belly the smoked fish or the various hairy crab preparations all are stunning","hot pot house",0.864398637737254
166,"im a rookie when it comes to japanese food i used to like japanese food a few years ago until i went to a restaurant that made me sick for days after that i couldnt eat any raw japanese seafood until last week when my friend forced me to eat at that restaurant

the sushis were amazing to the point that i fell in love with japanese food although its pricey i hope to go back again very soon as it was one of the best food experience i have ever had

i was there with four other friends so we couldnt be at the bar area and see the chef in action however we were lucky to see one of his students work his magic in the small room

cant wait to go back, small but very cozy japanese restaurant
beautiful design that reflects the culture of japanese restaurants
excellent service
very fresh fish and seafood amazing japanese food
at your choice  sake beer chinese wine or a small selection of western wines, the restaurant is a bit difficult for tourist the course was too big for me with so so quality of ingredients i am sure i have had better omakase in bangkok or singapore felt a bit dissapointed but read many reviews before i went so i prepare for some dissapointment for me omakase should have less bites with best quality of each bite i wouldnt recommend if you have had omakase before somewhere else this is not a must try place for best omakase, first time we tried sushi oyama was for my wifes birthday a few years back

when we were planning a vacation to visit shanghai again we booked the restaurant a month in advance to ensure that we got to try one of our favorite omakase restaurants again

the freshness of the sashimi  sushi was amazing the subtle flavors crept into those little mouthfuls was simply heavenly

having a chef by our table to prepare fresh sushi was an added bonus

service was as impeccable as our previous visit with little attention to details that made it more enjoyable

washing down our meal with sake was a must which added to the whole omakase experience u even get to choose your own specific sake cup

check out our photos, this small sushi place offers two servings a day  1830 and 2130  there is no menu card so you as visitor will have to become suprised by the delicious creations by the chefs whom you can see work in the kitchen from your tables

a delicious experience with some of the best sushi i have tasted, by far our favourite sushi restaurant in shanghai chef oyama is a genius with sushi the ambiance always friendly fascinating to watch the master at work behind the counter , tiny and cosy restaurant with a single sushi kitchen counter plus a small private room
we choose to sit on the counter so we can watch the skill of the native japanese master chef great freshly imported japanese seafood plus fine kitchen craftsmanship making excellent sashimi and sushi set menu one menu only plus extra order option for japanese prime beef and lobster dinner only
not cheap but a worthwhile treat if you are into fine food
compliments to a restaurant of customisation high quality and no mass production, i have been here numerous times for business and pleasure and the quality and variety is 2nd to none

for a business dinner i recommend a private room and their set menu which goes beyond the sushi focused menu you get at the sushi bar i have taken several clients from japan to this restaurant and they all thought it was fantastic and rivals top restaurants in japan

if not a business dinner i recommend the sushi bar excellent quality sushi

only draw back is the price tokyo quality highend meal with similar price, we were invited the dine in this must try omakase in shanghai
sashimi and sushi were superb with fresh cut of seafood in generous helping
oyama san was friendly told us name of fish in cantonese as he used to work in hong kong for few years

highly recommended, i made an early booking 3 weeks in advance to make sure to have a reservation for my girlfriend birthday its not that easy to find a table

that is why i was surprised when at the end of the dinner the staff came singing happy birthday with blowing candles flowers and a small gift

but honestly everything was perfect from starter to sushi and sashimi passing by a stunning beef and oysters amazing abalone on soy sauce jelly

what to say more it doesnt happen very often to have japanese sushi master rolling rare cut of fish such tuna liver on your table

service flawless, one of the best japanese meals ive ever had anywhere the set menu is thoughtfully designed and each course is as stunning as the next every ingredient was amazingly fresh the highest of quality and prepared to highlight the variety of flavours and textures perfectly

the service was lovely and i particularly liked the sushi handrolled at the table and the presentation is truly one work of art after another almost minilandscapes of food i ate in one of the smaller private rooms and the decor was classically minimalist i enjoyed some of the quirks like choosing your own sake glass from an eclectic tray of choices all in all fabulous

i cant wait to find a reason to return and as everyone has said it certainly comes at a price�but well worth it, the menu is set the decor is simple the sushi is sublime

this is not an inexpensive undertaking but it is the best sushi you will find in china and is really much better compared to tokyos restaurants

this sushi is so good it is an investment, great place for good sushi this place is up on the top floor of a villa here you can find fresh and exoctic style sushi book well in advance to get a reservation not the biggest restaurant and well in demand, this location is definitely the best japanese in shanghai
after living 9 years in shanghai i came several times

this time was not a disappointed visit fish is really fresh and service is excellent it s really price but is fair considering overall experience

very recommended, i was a bit disappointed as i awaited a sushi dinner and it was not

nothing against it food was good and well prepared for being in china but japanese sushi is different thing

i think they should care less about the set up of the plates sometimes seriously impressing and care more about the sushi experience they want to give to the clients most sushi places in japan dont even serve it on plates here the plate is the king and here and there they hide the dishes

quantity of raw fish was very minimal much less than any best sushi in tokyo i would have loved a bit more of it and less of the rest overall menu is at the end more than enough though and light

surely a place to go back given its quite atmosphere not easy to find in shanghai but if you looking for sushigo somewhere else havent discovered yet wherebut soon, a few years ago oyama was the best a few competitors have joined the scene in shanghai but oyama is still one of the best
we enjoyed dinner set at 1200 per person he served tuna belly sweet shrimps abalone some sashimi some sushi all expertly done
portions were not very generous after adding a few dishes like japanese beef etc the bill rose to 2000 per person, see the entire review with clear pics englishchinese <u+3010>httpmissneverfullcomshanghaisushioyama<u+3011>

i have been to lots of michelinstarred sushiya and was craving for highend sushi when i went back to china for summer oyama used be my top pick but i found the price of omakase menu increased over 50 in the past year from cny 800 to 1280 okay as long as the food is still good i told myself before i revisited

i found the shari sushi rice was too weak which consequently made all the pieces quite bland except some with heavy sauces while the service was still superb however cny 1280 = jpy 25000 which is a michelin2star price standard the quality definitely was disappointing regarding to this scale id rather like to fly to tokyo or hong kong for sushi, chef oyama always has the best freshest cut  most of the fish are deep ocean wild fishes  that makes it the best , i went there alone and its like i didnt really exist i was feeling like a animal in a zoo when they throw him food for that price 13000 yuan i felt like i was being stolenthe sushi i was served were very comon and the other guests were having special treat maybe because im a north american i was not taken seriouslydont go there if you think its a little bit overprice but you say to yourself it must be very special, sushi oyama is famous in shanghai i think the reason is for mr oyama himself he is very entertaining smart and a great conversationalist sitting by the bar i am very comfortable eating and chatting with him he makes it a great experience the food however is probably not the best the price paid for the food here is not really worth it many of my friends tell me this is the place to go and i think the only reason is that oyama was one of the first omakase restaurants in shanghai, i had a nice long omakase dinner at sushi oyama i asked the concierge at my hotel to call just that afternoon so i was pleasantly surprised that i could get a place in the early seating

there is room for ten at the sushi bar there were six japanese men a little group all regulars and friends of the chef so it was i think especially convivial around the bar

the chef and his sous chef got the evening going and kept on going as is the way everything was very fresh and delicious the fresh wasabi was nearly addictive

when all was said and done it was a $200 dinner just for me and i drank one beer and no sake so yes the fish is expensive but id rather have one meal like this with superb quality and loving presentation than a few just so so sushi meals where i come from i dont eat sushi at all its not that good so im always delighted to have the chance for some that is wonderful, i had a bad night in this restaurant i went alone for try one of the best sushi in shanghai according to trip advisor comments and few friends in town the sushi i try was just ok uni was a bit old and my tuna was really average maybe was a bad evening for the sushi master the price was quite too big for the overall experience, 10 course dinner tasting menu for 800 rmb per person plus drinks that would be around 130 usd dinner with drinks for 4 of us was 6000 rmb around 1000 usd
lets just say it was good but not that good that we would go back, food was just as good as in japan except the nigiri sushi was too small we were put in a small tatami room where we had the dinner course at first the pace of service was fast and good but then it really slowed down and had to keep opening the shoji door so that they could see us it was 10 to 15 minutes between each small course at this free time gave us much time to study the worn out interior such as the torn paper on the door and fake shoji window it was very expensive for two but we didnt see the value of what we paid, i loved finding this little gem on my superfuture map as a recommended place to enjoy top quality sushi at a fair price $95person they do take american bank visa cards by the way

they offer 1 set menu for the night in a kaiseki type of dinner i believe it was 10 courses and it was a balanced mix of sashimi and different types of cooked fish vegetables etc i couldnt eat only 1 item on the menu and they happily replaced it with something quite extraordinary 

besides the quality of food and presentation the chefs are very very cordial and easy to converse with they love what they do and dont make you feel uncomfortable if you ask the proper way to eat something or if you should use shoyu on something the waitresses are equally sweet and everyone seems very prideful of their job i really loved experiencing that aspect of this sushi dining experience

i will be back and thank you, every time i come through shanghai i come here with my japanesespeaking friends to hang out at the bar with oyamasan eat superb sushi and drink topquality sake

its expensive for shanghai dirt cheap for basically everywhere else and the quality is impeccable the menu is omakase but if you have preferences oyamasan will try to please your palate

highly recommend get reservations, i had dinner there with my brother and really enjoyed the experience we basically went for sashimi decent quality and well presented the atmosphere and set up are some of the nicest we have seen in shanghai and the food is really good fresh and varied
a must do in shanghai, my friends recommended this japanese 3 years before business is very nice reserve a table in advance is needed price is very high but worth it set menu is nice and the homemade sushi are elegant i love the salmon nigri and assorted sashimi dining environment is very quiet great, japan is not far from shanghai but this restaurant takes japan closer and closer
waitresses dress japanese traditional kimonos the chef is a real japanese guy entertaining the guests with his stories guests are used to offer him sake or beer and at the end of the dinner he will be particularly happy sushi is delicious and prepared with a lot of attention guests always receive good tips about how to eat what they are eating very nice atmosphere expensive, outstanding
this is the absolute best sushi i was ever given to eat and the experience will infidelity stay with me a while
simply succulent

otorro and botan shrimps were to die for all other offerings were good enough to feint for all preparations were done expertly and at the table

i would greatly advice this stop to anybody with a love for sushi even if considering the price tag it is a once in a lifetime experience it would be worth it

highest gratitude to the very friendly team for keeping such an upscale dinner very warm and family like, if want to try real raw fish go to oyama it s price but fair with the quality with many fiah imported the environment close to the chef is very comfortable and very quiet perfect place for a couple to celebrate something special you got my 5 stars, amazing sushi cool ambiance and the chef is a very good person fan of bocuse chef and beer
lover great meal at oyamas a little pricy but in my opinion it worth it, i a huge fan for japan cuisine all types of it you name it i live it
been going to oyama since he started about 6 years ago and been there frequently ever since i always think of great sushi chefs as artists and their food as a fine craft a full sensory experience and not just about the taste chef oyama strikes a great balance of artistry and yet have a great sense of hospitality with warmth and humility notice that i have yet to talk about the food reason being that the omakase experience is one that is really as the name suggest ill leave it to you meaning entrusting the chef to make the choices for you be sure that everything that is presented to you is a revelation in sight sound feel and taste its a great position to know that you can trust oyama san to ensure the best experience yet still surprise you every time you are there the prices have recently increased but the restaurant is still full its speaks volumes about the quality and loyal pilgrams that journeys there on a regular basis having been there over the years and knowing him it is great to see the continuous success and expansion of his business and yet he is able to consistently maintain such a high level of standard he deserves all the success he has at this point of my life he is on top of the list if i have to choose my last meal please go there, this sushi bar is absolutely an advice for japanese food lover the quality of the food is ultra fresh the set menu is very well done  balanced and the service is superb
great service, the quality of the food is 2nd to none but price is quite high around 800900 rmb per head so we only go there for special occasions mr oyama himself makes the sushi at the bar and usually very friends tip is to book early as the restaurant is very small with only around a dozen seats and if you have a special preference for a particular fish you can request it when you have the set dinner, fantastic japanese restaurant fixed menu prepared by the woner chef a small red bar reserved for a dozen customers what a privilege to dine in this restaurant memorable time there with oyama san the best sushi mastereverything is delicious it is a great experience dining in this restaurant in shanghai i recommend it counting 1000 yuan per person, memorable time there with oyama san the best sushi master in townovertop ingredientsgreat entrainement and same time great sake
go there is one best experience in japanese restaurant in shanghaihigh recommend , i come here a few times already  usually every time for my anniversary since 3 years ago and other special occasion as well its my favorite place and oyama san are also very friendly the whole night were expensive around 1000 rmb per person incl drinks but worth every penny make sure to make a resevation 4 1 week in advance to secure a seat because the seating are limited and best to ask for a seat infront of oyama san for get the best experiance, fantastic japanese fixed menu prepared by the chef very small location with few places in the main room and few private room fish fantastic a bit expensive 1000y each, probably one of the smallest restaurants i have been to but size definitely didnt matter in this case definitely one of the best japanese omakase restaurants i have been to around the world with all his food material delivered fresh daily from japan chef oyama made nearly every dish in front of us while charmingly amused his guests great experience all around with a steep bill, sushi oyama is nothing short of amazing the chef take oyama is a true master of the japanese cuisine
we all say we have had the best japanese or sushi and i am one of them but now i truly believe the best japanese is here at sushi oyama take the chef takes the time to talk to all his guests to under stand their flavor profiles and adapts that chefs menu to suit each and every guest this in its self is just amazing
chef take san i take my hat off to you you really are a master of your art keep up the good work and see you again for sure on my return trip to shanghai for another amazing meal, this is some of the finest japanese cuisine you will find anywhere in the world go for the omakase menu not cheap but it is dining perfection, its worth a trip from new york very friendly service highest quality of sushi in china i think chef oyama san is not afraid to crack a joke or serve you with a smile and since i dont eat shellfish and at the chefs table there is a set menu i was anticipating trouble for messing up the mojo of the chef but he and the staff were understanding and very accommodating and the food oh the food was the best like manna from haven with out having to discount or be happy because its in shanghai so what do you expect it was world class great, as other reviews mention its a omakase style restaurant small and cozy
food is personalized and the chef will guide you to experience sushi and suggest how to eat it
quantities are generous and the quality is out of the question bravo
its expensive but hey its definitely a must try, i have come here often esp on our wedding anniversery we always spend them here i love oyama san sushi and talking to oyama san himself his ika sushi and bonda ebi are the best and make sure you book ahead my suggestion 2 weeks ahead since they usually fully booked
also i have been to a few places with omakase from indonesia and shanghai and so far this one is the best and worth every penny oh also try the sake  i love how they let you choose your own sake glass very unique, this place is located in the same mansion as elefante  former el willy place on the second floor which makes this place quite private as the place is really small you feel dinning in someone house which can be nice and can give a really feeling of intimacy we were installed just right at the entrance on the corner of the sushi counter around 10 seat i was just in the corridor from the kitchen and back to the main entrance the place is really small and how we were installed was just uncomfortable there is not many space between every customers we didnt get the chance to changed our place as all the guest are arriving within the same timing the place was quickly pack honestly for a romantic dinner pass your way

the food
the service here is omakase  an unique menu with a unique price  even if its unique menu a written menu would be nice at least just to follow what they are servingalso because it seems that we have taste probably half less sushi than other guest strange in a place that suppose to have a unique menu

the food was really good probably some of the best sushi sashimi in town with a nice presentation as you can expected in such can of high end japanese restaurant

the service
thats the hard point

as we were quite discreet the attention were more focus on the noisy customers  a group of deep pockets expat + an other couple when you are coming to such kind of place with a unique menu you already know that your neighbor will also pay a consequent bill at the end of the dinner so its always absolutely incredible to see people do not respect other guest in such place
oyama san was completely run over by this group the result was a strong lack of attention to the others guest by spending more time to ganbei with those people and making for them some special sushi which we do not have the privilege to try probably half more than us for a place where you are supposed to have a unique dinner at a unique price its kind of strange
for us we got a small omakase menu for them it was an all you can eat buffet

or you do a private party and do not accepted other guest
or your treat all your guest with the same attention

there was a strong lack of customers management especially when you just have 10 person in front of you you have to tryed to pay enough attention to each of your guest casual atmosphere is good but here it was not casual just not manage at all

we came to sushi oyama to celebrate the birthday of my wife which should have been an exceptionnal moment and finally we got the feeling that we were noinvited guests to a private dinner because of a strong lack of management
if you go to high end japanese restaurant you are expecting the best japanese food which was the case but it should be also about the best from japan service attention to customer which was not

unfortunately at this kind of price you can have almost all the choice you want here in shanghai even if its probably one of the best sushi in shanghai i dont know why i should come again to spend so much money 3000 rmb for two to try it again even after one day after visiting sushi oyama i have a strong sour feeling about this experience, book ahead there are about 12 seats at the bar and they fill up quickly if you can get a reservation youll be in for a treat this is a true sushi experience with amazingly fresh fish ask the chef about the caligraphy behind the bar he did it and will tell you what it means and the beautiful japanese impressionist pictures of squid and fish on the walls attentive service from the staff who will keep your saki cup full extremely pricey for shanghai but so worth it, it is not cheap but for a special occasion definitely one of the best places to go you sit at a bar around the place where oyamasan is preparing the food and every bite was amazing all the food was super fresh and i love it that there is no menu so you get to taste some things you normally would not order, we are regulars at sushi oyama and we have become so spoiled by the quality freshness flavors and gentle touches of the food and service all other japanese restaurants to which we go are now somehow measured against how chef oyama would do it 

service is omakase  you are in his hands  and the thrills just accumulate over the evening the starters are amazing  the fish and rice are always at just the right temperature for the full expression of the flavor of the fish and the mouthfeel that accompanies it whether its uni or engawa or giant clam or mackerel all is good try the monkfish liver its to die for 

chef oyama does such a great job with sprinklings of yuzu ginger vinegars  there always seems to be that extra dose of flavor and texture and creativity and oh my god whatever you do dont stop now      

the sake selection is magnificently to the point so are the staff  whose caring gentle touches and vicious senses of humor make the show even greater

how do you do it chefsan, my friends and i shared quite a memorable dinner recently at sushi oyama we were seated at the counter and were able to watch and interact with oyamasan the skillful master chef who creates wonderful sushi pieces the sushi sashimi grilled and fried fish are all fabulous

167,"we spent a lot of time in shanghai 5 years ago which coincided with when the waldorf first opened here  so we stayed each time we loved the grand brasserie food and service so it was with some trepidation that we returned recently during a stay in shanghai nothings changed  food service comfort  its all still amazing, i stayed 3 nights at the waldorf here and breakfasts were included very nice buffet spread and other foods as side orders that can be ordered separately foods were always of high quality very attentive and friendly service too the waiter and waitress were trained well so they even remembered what i ordered yesterday amazing place, breakfast at the waldorf astoria shanghai was above and beyond my expectations first the entry from the old wing with the narrow oldieslooking meeting room opened up to a wide bright highceilinged two floored restaurant was elegant  dramatic second the hot dish was freshly prepared in addition to abundance of the buffet chinese tea quality was exceptional as a western restaurant will definitely return, this review is about my recent visit to the grand brasserie not the hotel
my mum and i visit on 24th jan 2017 we had lunch at the grand brasserie amazing setting great service i would like to thank jim for looking after us there was a minor incidence with one of the dishes we ordered to apologize we were offered free tea and dessert  the chocolate fondant which was delicious albeit a bit small many thanks we come here every time i go home to shanghai to visit my parents and will continue to do so in the future strongly recommend it, the food drink and hospitality of the venue are not in question  this is a relaxed and friendly dining hall which provides a wonderful selection of food and drink promptly served by professional and courteous staff

my main issue with the arrangement is that this grand space becomes the focal point for tourists above to hang around the balcony posting pictures of themselves looking down onto the unsuspecting diners below whilst they eat which makes for a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience this in turn removes a level of sophistication that the hotel should be able to command, i booked a room for my parents in waldorf to celebrate my parents 30th wedding anniversary and i decided to choose grand brasserie for their dinner i made a call to the restaurant and it was answered by maggie after sharing my concern about my budget she recommended me a very good deal on app enjoy in addition i wanted to add one or two courses for my parents and maggie very kindly gave me several advice though my parents anniversary is in 10 days i already feel that they will truly enjoy the time there, we had to send back the bread which was rock solid and the fries which were dry and tasted like they had been kept for days and refried just really dishonest for the prices they charge my husband had the bouillabaisse which he said was the worst he had ever tasted just horrible horrible horrible, we wanted to have a look at the long bar so upon entering spotted the brasserie with plenty if spare tables and decided to have lunch there
we wernt dissapointed with any if the food or service we shared the foi gras entree which was excetional then had the duck and the lamb which were equally as good the potato truffle puree had a small amount of black truffle on the top and lacked any taste of trufflewhich eas the only let down
the setting and the service were were impecable the price very fair only wish we had time to go back again this trip, the brasserie is a wonderful area set in a area which in its heyday could have easily been a grand ballroom with oval ceilings with chandeliers and marbled floors adjoining the restaurant is a garden with water feature waterfall breakfast is a hearty buffet while lunch and dinner is a la carte sunday is the famous buffet brunch the staff are well trained and courteous while the senior staff and chefs are only too happy to ensure dietary requirements are fully met including gluten free options, after 3 weeks in china and many luxury hotels the grand brasserie breakfast buffet was truly the best everything from congee to croissants  the buffet covers it all including excellent coffee

we also had a set menu dinner one evening the food was excellent the service is a bit slow but if you are not in a hurry an excellent way to spend the evening, they have an amazing breakfast buffet  the service is so friendly and welcoming thanks for having such a wonderful breakfast, breakfast is the best i have had in pan asia i would pay just to have breakfast the lunch and dinner offers a classy buffet sty dining, the sunday brunch at waldorf has always been on of the most exclusive ones in shanghai but on my last visit i noticed that staff attentiveness and service quality was really going down a lot had to continously ask for service or remind staff of orders even some tried hard the overall impression is that waldorf has really impressive hardware however the staff hr has a serious issue there that champaign comes at room temperature was also new to me besides dishes tasted excellent but sorry to say the glamour has gone, omg this should be a 5star hotel no it is not except for its high price and the historic building the waldorf astoria shanghai has become a big disappointment mainly because of bad management and lots of excuses on so called trainees really so the trainees are responsible for the 20 degree warm champaign throughout a whole sunday brunch the unbearable cigar smell the unattentive service the poor choice of food and the terrible guests putting their naked feet on the table i see but in such case you will neither see me nor any other sophisticated guest any more rip waldorf you killed yourself no i can definitely not recommend this place, the setting of this restaurant within the waldorf astoria is brilliant with an open ceiling overlooked by the balcony of the peacock alley as well as grand pillars the food was good nothing spectacular but decent we enjoyed the sea bass dish as well as the burger dish i am slightly annoyed that i can purchase a <u+00a3>20 burger meal and yet i need to pay an additional <u+00a3>3 for chips
we didnt like the drinks on offer at the brasserie so they went to the peacock alley and brought our drinks down from there which was helpful as we had credit to use we tried the vanilla and lychee martinis which were very strong and presented in superb looking glasses, i would like to say thank you to the team members of the grand brasserie at waldorf astoria shanghai you have done a wonderful job preparing serving one of the best breakfast i have ever had in any hotel

thanks again , amazing breakfast with unbelievable selections world class wait staff the eggs benedict are as tasty as ive ever experienced you will want to linger over another cup of coffee and not be eager to leave this exceptional restaurant
solid wine list for dinners, actually the brasserie is also where the bkfst is served absolutely delicious bread an a non ending choice of asian and european choices nice place for a business lunch in my opinion the setup and the size make it looks like a giant cafeteria not cozy or intimate nothing romantic on it however as the name suggest its a brasserie and at the end food is absolutely delicious, grand brasserie served one of the best chocolate fondant which was renamed as warm marble chocolate
the 2 courses of early bird dinner 1730 1900 daily was value for money in such high class hotel
waldorf champagne brunch with seafood and roast carving was also recommended, visited the restaurant for breakfast during my stay in march 2012

the restaurant was very nice so was the food but more oriented towards the chinese as opposed to tourists and so the variety of hot food should be more intercontinental not all the waiters had good english so one some days had to struggle a bit, excellent ambiance delicious food attentive staff value for your money i stayed there for chinese new year our dinner was scrumptious and certainly worth it considering the location and the ambiance of the place for breakfast however it being cny holiday one had to line up to get in and the lines were terribly long and the wait time on a hungry belly was too long i feel that the hotel should have anticipated that volume of guests given that it is the biggest chinese holiday and maybe opened up their other restaurants with the same cny buffet breakfast offer to accommodate the surplus numbers having said that the food was varied and delicious, we had recently a christmas dinner there on a friday with a group of 14 despite empty place service was inattentive but 4 course menu rushed through at 10 we were asked last orders even not being advised on that at booking not really the experience expected for a 5 star hotel and for the price paid fortunately there are plenty of better places at the bund, this kicks off at 1230 with champagne and canapes then at 2 the actual buffet is unveiled if you like oysters lobsters and generally seafood this is heaven as a vege i got my moneys worth in champagne but for my husband it was divine expensive at 900rmb each but worth it, for lunch

one of my pet peeves is when managers hover just within earshot as the wait staff take the orders its like i know were going to make mistakes so ill hang around until we do and then step in

the staff were all very pleasant but i dont think their training is complete the wait staff didnt know the menu my order was wrong and despite offers to change it i didnt want to waste food so took what cameunfortunately this was warm

and then the overzealous checking that everything is ok  one time too many just go away ive already told 4 managers not to worry

then the bill was wrong which i had to point outi was undercharged by 35

i left hungry

i was a little bit disappointed and am not sure if i would go back so quickly

a nice location however but the visual impact of the restaurant is let down by the details, i was invited for lunch in the waldorf astoria by my chinese colleague we were seated in the grand brasserie with a nice view on the garden the service is outstanding and de food of superb quality one to remember, had lunch here several times 3course lunch sets are great good quality  value staff are welltrained, we loved the start of the champagne brunch we were greeted by a tasty seafood selection and champagne in the lounge the home smoked salmon was excellent the atmosphere was great and we were excited for the rest of the brunch

after an hour we moved into the brasserie for the buffet and chefs specials there was a good selection of starters and roast meats the roast beef was super tasty the chefs specials were good but not fantastic the dessert options for the chefs special were disappointing and didnt deliver on taste

overall the service was ok but we didnt feel the entire meal was worth the high price compared to other champagne brunches the lounge seafood at the start was the best bit the rest was mediocre, great breakfast buffet lots of choices outstanding service you will not be disappointed great atmosphere too dinner is also very good, i travel a lot really a lot and i eat a lot in restaurants i know chefs i know that world and i love eating but i love eating well i have a very good nose and very efficient palate so food is important to me to me writing a critic for a restaurant is rather annoying there are a lot of good places to eat so many critics but like for this review when something special happen then i stop and tell about it the champagne brunch of the waldorf was exceptional

all you can drink in perrier jouet champagne all you can eat of the most delicate and well done food yes it is more expensive but it is worth every penny here we should say every mao you will save on the dinner anyway you will not need one

the brunch starts at the long bar not in the restaurant which is a brilliant idea you relax drinking this very good champagne with an assortment of good bites raw oysters cooked oysters a really good smoke salmon so delicate in taste several beautifully made spoon bites it was heaven

then when we feel ready we move to the brasserie where the buffet is waiting more champagne of course and then you can enjoy the cold selection some as bites with real caviar crab oysters salmon etc you can also choose extra dishes from the menu i had the scramble eggs with black truffle i wanted to test this one because i know how to do it well and it is easy to messup this was delightful also eating the 65c poached egg was a real pleasure their hollandaise sauce is really exceptional so good worth mentioning and what to say about the homemade gnocchi with black truffles creamy sauce very light delicate all the flavours are there to excite your taste buds and make you dream of one of the best moment of your life

the hot buffet was offering perfectly cook beef or lamb or a salt braised seabass so good so delightful

came the dessert part i am use to say that in life we can skip a meal but we should never skip a dessert and there please dont skip the dessert not only beautiful to look but the perfect ending of the perfect brunch hot chocolate cake strawberry mousse mango panna cotta home made ice cream etc it is not stopping and even a strong brain will have difficulties to resist

enjoy life make yourself a special pleasure an exceptional moment in good company add good memories to your brain and your soul try that brunch, great selections delicious choices and great service the atmosphere was fantastic and it made for a perfect evening ambiance very serene and the staff speaks perfect english which made it easier for us, have stayed in many hotels on the bund and in town definitely the best breakfast buffet great choice local and international items and best personalized service ever, i went there with my design business associates and have a casual breakfast meeting with shanghai friends who also is in interior design industry the construction surely spend lots of money and the service was great food presentation and the overall ambience meets its reputations, good buffet breakfast but pricey if not included in your room rate with american japanese chinese and german breakfast items eggs pancakes very small french toast are ordered from the menu but included in the buffet price they are fixed to order, breakfast is exceptional lots of variety whatever your taste or preference service is prompt and attentive, we ate several meals here and they were all very good however they were very expensive guess this is what you need to pay in this location but for the average traveler a bit much, was in shanghai visiting friends over the thanksgiving holiday my friends had made reservations at the grand brasserie for thanksgiving night and i am very glad they did food variety and quality were very good service was excellent and atmosphere beautiful it was an excellent place and way to spend the holiday, i had lunch twice here as part of a meeting package the lunch itself was ok but not spectacular  3 course meal every day from a fixed menu in the same place as breakfast for those who stay here service is outstanding and quality is great but not extraordinary especially considering the price, the brunch experience was mixed it was a just another normal buffet to me as i dont eat much but my wife thought the spread was good good experience but i am not willing to pay for the quality of the food again

in summary our boston lobsters was not fresh this was the conclusion from four of us who had stayed in boston before it sort of marred our dining experience to be fair they tried to do service recovery when we highlighted the issue but we were full and had to rush off

in summary i will not recommend eating here, we really had a great experience at the brunch first starting in the bar with the appetizer stand could be more wow and champagne after we have been escorted to the brasserie for the brunch a very big selection on starters sashimi main course and dessert as well a nice ala carte menu where you could order from everything from the buffet was very taste as well the dishes served however it took quiet long until they would arrive to the table as the kitchen was pretty busy refilling the buffet and cooking the ala carte dishes in the same time
but we had a good time and we really enjoyed the sunday brunch we will be back for sure, had my very first fancy brunch while in shanghai at grand brasserie last year best brunch promotion was ongoing so me and my brother decided to experience the fine dining at the luxurious waldorastorias signature grand brasserie alldaydining restaurant we had 3 courses of some choices from the a la carte menu while waiting for our meals complimentary mix breads were nicely served along with the olive oil and sea salt all the courses were amazing good presentation and nicely served by our hospitable chinese waitress limited english i also got a glass of chardonnay however it wasnt chilled enough and he poured too little not even a half of my tiny wine glass

there are many burgers to choose from all between 5989rmb with a choice between 3 types of fries french fries waffle fries and shoestring fries waffle fries were well baked and the burger was simple but of good taste

overall fine for a quick lunch, nice burger good taste and good portion the fries were a bit raw the place is nice but has like 3 floors and feels like a maze service was fine too the toilet stinks and dirty, went there by myself and the place felt quite nice they have all the choices you need for burgers

it took quite a long time before i got my burger but when i got it the burger was really nice even if the french fries were disappointing the were not crispy enough and all soft in the middle, after wondering around the french concession area food was required
already experienced plenty of local cuisine so we wanted something different
this place came up trumps
whether a burger or steak  our party of 4 gave this place 5

not too expensive either, it was not easy to get there due to no big signs it is behind other chines restaurant the place is great as well the food real ny style i really enjoy, i went here with friends for dinner i found the menu a little limited to just steaks and burgers there was no real starters to choose from
food was excellent i had a cheese stuffed burger large moist and filled with cheese
everyone in our party of 9 had a burger of some description and all enjoyed them
they have a small covered outside eating area but the mosquitos were out in force so we had to sit inside
service was very good but i wouldnt say excellent just as sometimes our waitress needed reminding to clear the table the place is reasonably priced good for shanghai and in line with the area it is a little off the beaten track so look out for the sign and just follow the lane all the way to the end
we all would recommend the irish cream alcoholic milkshake, was in town for business meeting this place is located within a great shopping area with all kinds of small walkways going all over we held our team dinner here i had one of their steaks which was very tasty few long island ice teas too great little place, i went there with a group of friends on weekends surprisingly there were plenty of empty seats considering that how my friend boast they served the best burger in town the service was efficient and they speak english too nice ambience to complement our meal they might not the best burger restaurant for me but certainly top 10 in shanghai, this restaurant is located in a tucked away corner surrounded by other restaurants and small shops in a quaint alley away from the hustle of downtown shanghai

the building is narrow and therefore three stories high

the interior is simple without much decoration and a bit worn looking

we ordered burgers and cheesecake

the burgers were okay but not great not repeat worthy
cheap dry bread
okay meat
the fries were fine
so was the cheesecake but the slice was terribly small given the price we paid

the waiting staff spoke basic english but was not overly attentive and on their cell phones most of the time

the table chair salt shaker ketchup bottle etc were all sticky to the touch

the bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned ever

i will not go here again, so cali burger is closed for renovation and i really want an american burger since i live in shanghai now for 1 year and missing home i look online for the best burger in town and it was down to mortons and this place i am not gonna dish out $$$$ for mortons for a burger and this place is reasonably price for their gigantic usda beef burger and i have to say that this reminded me of home

the restaurant is located in tianzifang the waiters spoke english and service was great i got the brooklyn bbq and the blue cheese burger and both were delicious the sauce is not overpowering and the burger highlights the beef we ordered medium rare and the burger came out super juicy the fried onions are more for the flavor not super crunchy texture its definitely usda beef and not from australian beef each burger comes with the side of fries we also tried their milkshake the texture is thick no ice shards i would like it serve in colder temperature than the slightly cold

the restaurant have its own bathroom with toilet paper and paper towels and soaps

im writing the review 2 days after so i know that i didnt get sick from this place as the other reviewer had mentioned definitely would come back to this place

overall i think this place is good for the food and great for the value considering that you do not have to pay the same price as in ny no tiptax, i went there by accident  and well  what a nice fortuity
we sat on the terrace  nice weather  not crowdy  nice music on the speakers 
we ordered the atomic and bbq burgers  both were big burgers  appealing  and the taste was really good  i ordered medium rare and my wife medium well and were cooked at perfection 
staff was attentive and nice 
2 burgers+beer+coke+vainilla milkshake around 30� or 36$  not expensive 
great evening we spent there , had a quick dinner solo and also looked at a few other meals being served i had the steak sandwich  a modest sized ribeye on a well baked roll seasoned with some blue cheese and topped with lettuce and tomato

tasty good quality meat this would be average in the usa but compared to chinese beef it was great as some other reviewers noted good choice for long term travelers or expats who want a taste of usa style food

i had never seen the tianzifang area before might be worth a trip just to see the place another writer described it as xintiandi without the high prices and pretension and i would agree fun area but be aware that its a bit hard to find you may need to mill around at random to find the restaurant keep your eyes open  there are some signs but also note that few of the chinese in the area know the english name of the restaurant

for those unfamiliar with xintiandi  this place is in the middle of the old french concession and has been extensively renovated to preserve a lot of the original architecture its now chock full of little shops restaurants and bars if you want a look at shanghai of the 1920s and 30s you can have a peek here xintiandi is the same kind of deal but is upscale trendy and expensive, i ordered the burger it came with fries the staff was police and the food came out quickly i was a bit in a hurry and paid the bill quickly it was the first time i was there the prices are not low similar to shanghai brewery, venue and service are ok but the food was most likely not clean the last time ive been there i ate a filet vegetables french fries when i got home i felt already a bit sick and after another hour i started to throw up the undigested meat vegetable and fries not many guests recently im wondering whether this is because of low food quality please keep everything clean and use fresh ingredients, great burgers and salads mind blowing prices are affordable great location too although not in the centre of tianzifang, when you get together with your friends i think its only natural to compare notes on who has the best what in town this more often than not spirals into a competition of best burger best pizza etc not surprisingly this restaurant comes to mind in any burger competition sadly nyssb has not kept up with the competition in this department three years ago i would have said this is the best burger in town now i would say its average, sometimes you just need a great burger after all the asian food its among the one or two best hamburgers we had when living in shanghai in 2014 the restaurant has lots of seating levels and when the weather is right sitting outside is really fun as the sun goes down great way to end a shopping people watching afternoon in tian zi fang, im not sure what all the fuzz is about but i was very disappointed in this place i was really looking forward to a good burger in shanghai and sure enough new york style and burger popped up on tripadvisor lots of good reviews 4 stars really
i thought i probably just went on a bad day so went back for another take sorry but not only were the burgers just ordinary at best but the service was really bad on both occasion, if you looking for a place who does some western cuisine this is the right place
the burger are decent and not really expensive
service a bit slow but overall a good place to go, my mushroom swiss burger was fantastic but the manhattan monster my friends ordered looked even more incredible quality meat fresh ingredients good presentation my only complaint is that the service was a little slow and indirectmight have been a language barrier the milkshakes were soso but the burgers y their location in tianzifang is a plus because its such an interesting neighborhood where historical shanghai meets commercial success, this used to be my favourite steak and burger place in shanghai took 3 friends who were visiting from overseas truly appalling the hamburger was ok but much smaller than it used to be

but the steaks were abysmal i ordered a rib eye i got a strip loin it was tough stringy and not flavourful at all on top of this the waiter or manager i really dont know argued with me and lied about the cut of meat as a chef for over 20 years experience i know a cut of meat he was rude arrogant and stupid just what you need in a service industry

my friends steaks were the same honesty if i served someone a 240rmb steak you would not need a steak knife but these were so tough you had to hack through them it was pretty disgusting

also you cannot access this place any more i tried to make a reservation every time i sent it the dialogue box would as me to enter a correct email address there was however no place to enter an email address cannot call nobody answers

i dont know who is running this place now but avoid it like the plague, had a good meal here with some colleagues some of whom were looking for a break from chinese foo after some time in china we were overall pleased with the experience it is not the easiest place to find but once you find the alleyway you just need to look for the signs the steaks we had were good if not great the burgers were probably a better experience overall the chips were very good
whilst relatively small the place has quite a good atmosphere the service was pretty average overall, located in a tiny alley this wonderful restaurant serves the best burgers in town

service is great but the waitress does not speak english body language is recommended

the mushroom swiss burger and tbone steak are out of this world

recommend to all

photos attached, the best burgers you can find in shanghai at the given pricelevel around 70 yuan for a shutupthisissogoodburger is extremely cheap compared to western prices try the damn yankee you are not going to be disappointed , im a burger guy and in general a food enthusiast coming from a land down under where the best beef comes from is a blessing when i heard about shanghais best burger i just had to try it

i got the bbq burger basic burger with some included in frills like onion rings this burger is great as per the title of my review with meat cooked to exactly your tenderness medium or medrare is a must great juicy meat with adequate lettuce plus onion rings although not crispy and pickles added to the flavours

the only drawback is the price set at tourist pricings 80 yuan upward for your burger is high considering what i can get for the same price at home

definitely try it if its on your budget even if its just to say you did true foodie attitude, went there with some work friends very good burger big and tasty order the big boy burger the chillies cheese fries were good too also the area we we were is pretty cool to walk around, absolutely an awesome burger near the top of my list for burgers in china and i have visited a lot of burger places here trust me my only problem was the area sure if you want to visit tianzifeng you can go and check it out but for me i just wanted to get in enjoy my burger and get out its tough there with the crowds of tourist i would go back just not on a weekend with a million tourist to fight through, i have to go to china but i can not stand chinese food so my release in shanghai is always the new york style steak and burger

food arrives in a timely manner with a smile and always tastes sensational beer is cold and plenty of bars in walking distance to wash away the meal

spot on, we went searching for burgers and this is where we ended up the burgers were delicious and definitely satisfied our cravings good value for money i would definitely go again, came here with my friend and we both ordered a burger one of the best burgers weve ever had the meal was big so did not even need to eat dinner that night service was normal for china definitely would go back, my first visit here was rather boring the food was nice but there was little attempt made to create any sort of ambience overall it made for a rather dull evening not one ill be rushing back to, the food was okayi ordered the bbq burger and i also ordered the burger with blue cheese but it was sweet the service is good though , alcoholic milkshakes and a delicious bbq burger the burgers are fantastic the service is typical for china its my favorite place to eat in shanghai its good priced for what you get lots of food usually just eat this and nothing else in the day, what an unexpected surprise in the middle of a lot of dim sum and noodles
an excellent burger and fries at a fair price, it have been the most deliciuos burguer in shanghai and the milkshake is also good the price of the burguer is expensive but it worth each yuan you pay, after reading an article about top burgers in shanghai had to visit this place as we are always looking for a great burger or steak we ordered the manhattan monster a regular cheeseburger and a filet the manhattan monster had a lot of flavor due to the chili and sauces on the burger the other burger and filet were bland with little flavor the fries baked potatoe and garden wedge salad were good i agree with other posts the service is not good if you are in the tianzfang area and are hungry wouldnt rule it out, if you are in shanghai and you are craving for a burger but you do not want to go to any chains of the fastfood industry this is the right address great location it is in the middle of tai kang lu but difficult to find simply ask around

the burgers are pretty good as well as the ribeye steak beers and cucumber gin tonic are good service is average the restaurant is clean according to shanghai standard do not even think to visit the restroom it is very dirty your complain will not meet their standard of service, paid approx 600 for 4 burgers + 1 ribeye steak + a few drinks + one apple pie
overall i would rate this place as one of the best joints in shanghai

possible discomfort
1 small space in a tiny building feels like dining in hong kongtokyo
2 assistant waitress do not speak english
3 sangria had too little alcohol
4 apple pie was kind of just out of fridge with no added value hope they would think about adding at least a scoop of ice cream

comforts
1 big size even the petite kids version is big enough for an adult
2 ribeye 238rmb was the best i had in shanghai so far had some sinew but belongs to an acceptable level for a shanghai steakhouse approx 75 of the meat was consumable no fat or sinew whereas only 50 of the steak would be eatable at other places
3 both burgers and steaks had nice smokey bbq flavor not sure whether it was artificial but nontheless they tasted nice

make sure to book a seat especially on the weekends, burger was good as was the milkshake service was not good but burger made up for it recommend the area so if a toss up between here or elsewhere come here and take in the local shops if you struggle to find it ask a local as it is in a deadend, we went there after a week of chinese food and we wanted to try some wellknown flavors� located in the art district in tianzifang this place accommodates table on a couple of floors oddly enough despite the name of the restaurant it is hard to find someone speaking decent english the steaks were good but probably this is not the most place to have dinner in shanghai  i would recommend some traditional chinese spots, this burger and steak restaurant is located at the end of one one of the alleys in tainzifeng and the deco is nice

had the manhattan monster burger it was not monster size but it washuge the taste was ok and the price was very reasonable service was good

in my opinion you can find better burgers in other areas of shanghai but if you are hungry and looking for a reasonably priced burger restaurant in the area of tianzifeng this is a good place to go, we heard about the burgers at nysb so we had to try the burgers were pretty good not great but pricing wise they are a good deal our main problem with the restaurant is the bad smell as you go in to make matters worse they have a glass wall so you can see inside the kitchen its not as bad as some places in shanghai but the 2 bugs standing on the glass did not leave a good impression for us unfortunately, the burger is better than the steaks the thickcut fries were very good too did not had starter or dessert paid rmb80 corkage payable in cash only for bringing a bottle of red wine i felt service was ok not as bad as what some of the other reviewers said the service wasnt as warm as some other places but did the job fine, my girlfriend and i had dinner here last week we had the chili bowl as a starter big boy and the manhattan bbq burgers for mains and a bottle of french wine total bill came up to rmb 400

the chili is served in a bread bowl tasty with just the right level of spicyness the burgers were excellent the fries were crunchy and cooked perfectly the manhattan bbq is served with onion rings on top thinly cut and crispy they went really well with the burger we had such a good meal there that we went back the following week after gourmet cafe closed this place takes the best burger in shanghai crown, this is our go to place in shanghai when we want a nice western meal at a reasonable price burgers are great the quality can vary a little as they ground their own from steak trimmings steaks are ok to above average we always get the onion stack it too varies depending on the cook i guess sometimes perfect sometimes overlooked we go at least once a month","Sichuan cuisine",0.999722189739707
169,"excellent food nice location quick service and many more etc i loved it please try once keep it up karvan, the restaurant offered halal food and has good staff who are eager to help  i ordered the lamb chops  over $30 for 4 pieces   tasteless and one price is so hard and the other three tasted like steamed meet   salad cost $12 and lemonade $6  i wish i did not go  sorry , it is a restaurant in the second floor in a very central areathe decoration nothing specialfood is good prices are acceptable and the service needs a little improvmentif you like that king of cuisine is a goof choice in that area, kervans is located right opposite le royal meredien hotel and has a giant lit halal sign its visible from nanjing pedestrian walk

we appreciate that the menu was in english although the staff could also speak english good variety of food and the portions were plentiful

price wise expensive 3 mains 1 french fries 4 drinks was 500 yuan most expensive meal weve had in shanghai so far they also sell alcohol on the premises but it looks like the muslim diners were seated in a different section i think maybe

nice deco love the sinks good service but just too expensive, the meal ive was one of the best meals ive ever had i know its a huge statement but it was delicious the service was also really good we had the meat platter and the kebabs would highly recommend to others, we had a great evening at kervan the food the service the atmosphere all fantastic the interior is very special almost theatrical with high ceilings warm colours and beautiful murals some nights they have belly dancing the restaurant was pretty full the night we were there and everybody seemed to be having a lot of fun would recommend without hesitation, it may be a bit difficult to find this restaurant for the frist time customers inside the place i was surprised by the interior desolation and was absolutely beautiful the food was also great my friends and i had lahmacun which was one of my favorite dishes it looks like a pizza in turkish version you can make your own pizza with vegetables and meats as you like i really liked it and then we had lamb liver and chicken grill both were very tasty for me yet some people may find it difficult to like the taste of lamb liver because it has a particular smell and taste but is worth trying once at least as for desert we had a chocolate lava which was hot chocolate fudge with a full of melting chocolate inside and turkish red tea a great combination i pretty much enjoyed the turkish dishes they serve in this restaurant personally one more important thing about this restaurant not only this one but when it comes to the bathroom it tells you about the place the bathroom in this restaurant was kept clean and neat considering others in shanghai overall i would like to come back here again, i enjoy middle eastern food and wanted to explore options in shanghai

i found kervan through word of mouth and the fact that it was close to where i live was a plus

it was very easy to find the restaurant using apple maps i was seated swiftly and the waiter was able to clarify my queries quite well

i ordered the chicken sharwama with rice the portion was large but the chicken was absolutely terrible i gave up trying to eat it after a few bites

i had the turkish beer efes and that was the only positive aspect of my visit

id not go here again, after 3 weeks of just chinese food we were after something a little different kervan orient express did not disappoint the food was lovely dip and bread to start followed by lamb chops and salad a bit more expensive than the local food we paid similar price to what we pay back in australia for same type meal, i have been at this restuarant many times
place is very near to nanjing road  access is good
service is cery good  friendly staff it is not very clean but ok
good for business meetings and large groups
they serve shisha tea coffee  sweets after lunch  dinner
food is delicious but some times i felt materials are not fresh
price is not avarage  somehow is expensive compare to food quality
totally is fine place, the location is unbeatable staff was very helpful  all options are fast and tasty  some nights special belly dancing show available definitely recommended and if you are not turkish dont forget to try raki  owner mr ugur was very kind and spending special efforts to all guests show nights maybe booking necessary feeling like home on long trips  we will go again, the food was delicious strange part is the place is offering halal food and wine and alcohol in the same place make me suspicious about is it really halal food or not, this was a very good alternative to the other cuisine we sampled while visiting shanghai pleasant ambiance good service and very good food, first of all i need to say that food was really amazing especially if you are a little bit tired of chinese dishes and love turkish food so much we came there for turkish night with belly dance traditional music great food and friendly atmosphere good service hign quality of food and great location2 minutes from nanjing road make this restaurant special also there is a lot of space for big family dinners different celebrations and etc we were so enchanted by kervan that we came next day to try turkish breakfast and it was beyond all praise freshbaked bread olives variety of cheese a lot of vegetables menemen pide and of course turkish tea so if you are fond of turkish cuisine or you want to try it dont miss a chance and visit kervan i would higly recommend to bring your chinese friends with youthey would love it my did, good food the mezze platter was good and we liked the meatballs it was a nice break from the chinese food  the only downside was the waiters lack of english meaning one dish never arrived but we knew no chinese so that is more our fault, i have gone to this restaurant quite few times during last few years it used to be one of my favorites but unfortunately in last 3 visits i found that all in all quality is dropping down wards first of all the food quality is not the same as before i am not sure but maybe they have changed the chef or� meanwhile recently many of the main food in the menu is not available and you have very limited choice in addition the newly brought up girls as waitress have no experience or attitude of being a good host also the prices are going sky high i used to recommend this restaurant to my friends but not anymore i hope the management reconsiders and shape up the quality again, i went there for lunch because it was relatively cheap and right next to my hotel i had the caesar salad with chicken and the doner with rice both items were very good nothing spectacular but definitely worth the price and i would go again for lunch, as a turkish ive never a pide like this it was delicious lamb and cheese in it manager onur very attentive and polite but other staff has a lot to learn from him highly recommended this restaurant, i have been kervan turkish restaurant this restaurant amazing good service wonderful kebab if you want good food address is kervan orient express, very clean and neat restaurant food is very good  ordered kebab with turkish raki that was really good on top you can order shish a to make combo definitely a must to go if you want to try something else than chinese food especially something mediterian, awesome food great cocktails and service need to mention a beautiful belly dancer to entertain us really nice atmosphere fresh and clean feel, enjoyed the authentic turkish food and entertainment order the apps and kababs great service would come back when in shanghai, visited it multiple teams already good ambience and really good food the baklava was really good too, if you want to go to a friendly place suggest to visit this warm turkish restaurant every year our favorite place in shanghai, we ate here because of the good reviews i found it was very overpriced and the food had a strange flavour the food was well below average and i would not recommend it to anyone, i go very often to this place good food and good service even they remember me and my preferences very impressive to me food i will go for kebabs i am turkish they buy some of their products from turkey food little modified to chinese flavour which is except able, i ate in kervan multiple times and every dish we tried was excellent from the soups to the salads the place from the inside is lovely i really liked the athmosphere and the decoration its really close to peoples square so its easy to reach i enjoyed kervan orient express very much and would recommend it to others, 5 minutes brisk walk from the grand central hotel in the street behind the nanjing east shopping road this small lebanese style restaurant makes a welcome change of dining while travelling through china lots of good dishes to share on a cold winters evening middle eastern platters dips breads mixed grilled meats kebabs etc great wine some belly dancing and great service that included complementary tea and sweets we would definitely return if we came this way again, this place should be called kervan disoriented notice i did not include express there is nothing express about this place i have been eating here off and on through different owners for years this version although well decorated is so poorly run it is not even funny i realize this is china and things are not always perfect i have been traveling china for close to 20 years and have been to cities big and small from east to west north to south the cluelessness here ranks up top with any i have experienced in china i was pleasantly surprised to see the updated environment it felt promising i then received the menu or should i say the turkish lesson book with food items listed in it if you read any of my reviews i am not the guy to complain about cost i have no issue paying for a premium experience the prices on the menu were comparable to the highest quality restaurants in shanghai much higher than i have seen turkish food priced anywhere the first waitress arrives not knowing she speaks no english i speak in english she runs away and begs for someone else to take the lao wai table the travesty is if she had just said ting bu dong i do not understand i would have <u+feff>just spoke chinese or at very worst point at items next server comes along and i order a chicken calzone some time goes by and the server returns and tells me they are out for the day it sounds like calzones are premade i then order a beef calzone 35 minutes go by and still no food it is strange that something that appears premade is taking this long i then ask another server where my food is mind you no one has returned to my table to check on me after a confused phone call between server and kitchen i am told just one more minute my time in china has taught me that a minute could easily be an hour i tell her if my food is not there in one minute i am leaving 3 minutes later i ask for my bill enough time has passed to make this dish especially when there is only one table occupied in the whole place low and behold the food shows up and i do not accept it i am still charged for the soda this is a rudder less ship rudder less ship restaurants in china can cause much worse problems than just wasted time, i have tried this restaurant for more than 7 times with my family friends and business dating every one can smoke contaminated atmosphere not suitable for families and business meeting waiters dont understand english you are not taken good care of
you will become tired of explaining what you want very dirty tea cups really can not understand how the owner is reluctant in this regard smoking is an offence these days and any individuals know this so it means that the management is naive and uneducated, if you read other reviews from me you will see that i pretty much like every place i go to i have to tell you that my wife and i visited last week and had a terrible experience it was a friday night and kind of busy we ordered some appetizers and drinks and then waited for 20 minutes for an entree the whole time the hostess was smoking hookah at the table next to us and our waitress was busy upstairs after 20 minutes of waiting we devoured all the bread apps and asked to cancel the entree but they refused saying that it was too late a couple minutes later they sent the entree to our table and asked us to pay we were the only ones complaining either we commiserated with the tables around us too many other places to eat in area to go here and suffer, awful food kebabs were dry and tasteless to top it off extremely expensive for shanghai and portions small we ended up leaving after our meal and going elsewhere for more tastier food, very good authentic turkish food in a friendly atmosphere good service
good for lunch or dinner
nothing to complain about plenty to enjoy, yesterday i was with my wife in the kervan food was amazing service was quick but i would like to say thanks to olga that she cared about us she always asked about everything is fine or not she was friendly and so polite she recommended food also she speaks good english  so each customer can talk with her but also we saw that she cares with each customer in the restaurant thanks so much  we will come back one more time, turkish foods and raki also turkish coffee like in turkey  i will say everybody this place because it was great day thank you so much for everything, we had a quick lunch together with my business friend kebabs were pretty average and too dry service was slow tea was free price value for kebabs really so so

very average place in my opinion, we were in there to enjoy turkish foods the waiters were helpfullwe spent more than 4 hours on third floor nobody bothered us and waiters keep servicing us smilingly, i have been 2014 december it was cross of my hotel owner of the kervan is soo kind and hospitality man  staff is well educated but the main problem is their english not good as billion of chinese all the kebaps is tasty and delicious it has 2 floor and prefer the second one more bigger and fresh it was a dream that they can offer turkish spirit like a raki in china hope to you enjoyed turkish delicios meal at shanghai, great food great service great hookah love everything about kervan owners really friendly staff is well trained great to hold a small or big party group, its quite easy to spot this place among all the nice restaurants among this area once you get in youll find the interior design of this place very delicate and classic the food is really good to the most fantastic part the shishahookah highlights the whole part you can chat with your friends while enjoying the amazing oriental joy, the food is amazing<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c> and reasonably priced staff is attentive and the atmosphere is very chilled and relaxed, authentic setup<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d> relaxing atmosphere en not forgetting the food which is the finest of turkish food and dessert attentive staff too, tasty food and great atmosphere and affordable i would recommend it to u all  <u+0623><u+0643><u+0644><u+0647><u+0645> <u+0637><u+064a><u+0628> <u+0648><u+0627><u+0633><u+0639><u+0627><u+0631><u+0647><u+0645> <u+0627><u+0648><u+0643><u+064a> <u+0627><u+0646><u+0635><u+062d><u+0643><u+0645> <u+0641><u+064a><u+0647> <u+0634><u+0628><u+0627><u+0628> , food was warm not hot
we had meed that was in our personal opinion not coming from the grill at all
we did not receive the chicken oregano but a chicken
chicken meet was too soft for good quality
the vegetables had no flavour of its own
the spices are not spicy
compared to the food in middle east this is made for people who are not used to real spicy and who nothing else than the low quality meat
drinks are too expensive
avoid sitting in front of a speaker its too loud
shisha smells all over if you are a non smoker this is actually no go, the waiters had no idea what they were serving and were quite inexperienced food wasnt remarkable in any way too many choices in this city to a place as bland as this, i have been to turkey many times but somehow have never experienced such a good food maybe it only hit our taste just right
we decided to get in after we saw a shisha standing by the entrance because i love it we got in and have one we only wanted some drinks and shisha i must say that somehow i never was lucky enough to find a good shisha in turkey so i wasnt expecting too much andfinaly a good one so thats why i give them 5 stars
then we decided to try their mix grill plate for one person and fajita doner perfect all types of meats were very tasty and combinations with pita bread satisfied us on 100 i think that visitors should understand that waitors are from china language barier and mistakes in orders are the part of the adventure at the end its no michellin star restaurant so dont expect such a service their attitude was very good and thats why i also made myself to write this long review, some of the turkish food here is serviceable enough and the location is terrific but everything else about my dining experience at kervan was tortuous due to the awful atmosphere and intensely slow and oblivious service

my partner and i were seated on the third floor where much to our chagrin somebody the owner of the restaurant according to the wait staff started messing around on a drum kit shortly after our food came out he was practicing his jazz drumming  without the rest of a jazz ensemble picture a truly mediocre dinner eaten to a pounding soundtrack of offbeat loud and amateurish drumming our complaints about the noise were completely ignored id add that this was during peak dinner hours  around 730pm

a few more notes about the food the hummus is atrocious  it has a consistency reminiscent of chunky peanut butter its swathed in grease and yet it has no flavor whatsoever  its far worse than $4 supermarket hummus the bread dishes are plain but portions are generous the meat dishes are wellspiced and wellcooked but they tend to serve them with far too much oil and salt all in all its nothing to write home about the food is bland and mediocre especially when compared to really good turkish food sadly unavailable in shanghai

i wouldnt visit this place again under any circumstances, this place has a great lunch set we got there just in time for this actually we were a little past the time but they let us have it any way which was great   the chicken kebab wraps were delicious and the greek salad was bright and fresh the evening menu looked substantially more expensive then the day time menu but the food was really good, i thin the greek walnut salad i had was the best salad i have had in my life the service was very poor but the good food made up for it they had more servers than customers but you practically had to tackle one to order or ask for your food we were there for lunch and noticed that those who ordered the prefixed menu seeme to get their food quicker than we did the menu had lots of good choices, we were late still needed dinner and found this restaurant it was a very special experience ordered dark beer but got light beer pointed it out to the notsobright waitress but she assured me that i was wrong so i went to the fridge myself to get the beer i wanted then we got our main courses they had just arrived when the starters arrived yes in that order the waiter practically refused to take them back no apologies i think the food tasted ok but we ate fast to get out of there","Taiwanese cuisine",0.570720683512207
17,"dtf is a good restaurant clean and simple service is always professional and quick if looking for a good clean reliable dumpling restaurant that will not scare any guests this is the best option it is not the most authentic experience you can find for traditional shanghainese soup dumplings in fact dtf is not even shanghainese it is a famous interenational taiwanese chain restaurant the classic shanghai locations will provide a more adventurous dumpling experience but dtf is a better choice if you are looking for a more civilized meal, we first discovered this chain in singapore and were so impressed with the quality of their dumplings that we dined there two evenings in a row we are now in shanghai and we are once again extremely impressed with the food at din tai fung whether it be the dumplings or the sauteed vegetables everything is delicious the window to the kitchen area where men dressed in white with gloved hands and hats as they fill and seal dumplings is a fun addition service is incredibly attentive and friendly and the meals come out of the kitchen quickly and are always piping hot

if you want good food and great service this is the place to go it is tricky to find so here are some instructions

go to the portman ritz carlton on west nanjing road head up the hotel driveway towards the entrance with the hotel entrance facing you walk to the left side of the building there you will find a small grouping of shops and restaurants including a starbucks with the hotel at your back you will be facing the starbucks from there walk around to the left of starbucks and there you will find the entrance to din tai fung

enjoy, strongly recommended by a friend from shanghai far surpassed expectations had several types of dumplings all which were great the shanghai fish was also excellent strongly recommend service was also very fast, one of the best and well known places for your steamed xiao long bao definitely try here if you are fond of having some delicious jiao zi bao zi the soup is almost always inside whenever you chew it have a great time eating i love it so much, for any western visiting asia this is a must dumpling dandanmian stir fried string bean and many more signature dishes
better to go with friends and order many different things, i went to this restaurant several times with friends and in couple amazing xiao long bao and dumpling also very good taste for vegetables with a big variety to try absolutely the sweet ones, great love it you have to go
this place is one of my favorites been going to shanghai for years and when i go i come here i also frequent hong kong and this dim sum is not hong kong cantonese style dim sum as the selection is not equal at all but the selection they do have is just superb

must try foods
 xiaolong bao  a must try here
 pork chicken and crab dumplings

consistent food all the time no matter how many times i have come here its a1 unlike many china restaurants that dont require tipping they automatically add in a 10 tip and dont complain because you would want to give a tip here its that good

a must try and go with friends its a great place to eat highly recommended, be tried several dim sums and other food for lunch it is for sure the best in town and ver y conveniently situated on nanjing road, hand made dumplings and xiaolong bao the price is quite expensive so around 100 yuan each person but to be tried amazing taste, great food really seems that care has gone into making the food everything is truly delicious will be back next time i am in shanghai, sometimes you find a place and you wished you would have found it earlier the service is outstanding especially for shanghai standards the atmosphere feels genuine and traditional and the food is delicious dont forget to take the dumpling with pork and crab meat, i really enjoyed the dim sum very friendly and accommodating staff i will definitely be back on the next visit to shanghai, i went to din tai fung and really enjoyed myself

i had several of the dumplings as well as several different orders of fried rice

clearly this place caters to westerners as there menus were in both chinese and english the service was very good the staff were very patient with our slow ordering lots of choices this may have something to do with being next store to the uk consulate

they are about 2 kilometers west of tomorrow square on nanjing i enjoy this section of nanjing road more so than the pedestrian area to the east less crowded but still an enjoyable walk in the evening, i was eating in this restaurant several different excellent meals for the last 2 years always nice stuff efficient service tranquil atmosphere and above all  delicious chinese food which any foreigner can enjoy, just the usual excellent food and service but cannot you cannot visit shanghai without coming here, at dinner i tried the dumplings for the first time and they are definitly going to be on my menu soon  wow nice restaurant with fast and friendly service for a good price not expensive kitchen staff all wearing masks and you can see how they create your food a great place for a chinese dinner and the menu has pictures so it is convenient for nonnative chinese readers , delicious dim sums prok and chicken dumplings are the best as wellas other salted and sweet great vegetables and baked rice try the fruit juices, if your sights are set on trying a shanghai delicacy xiaolongbao specifically or just a really good meal  this is the place to go all of the food was delicious but the centerpiece of just about any meal here are the xiaolongbao dumplings they were cooked to perfection  tender enough with just the right amount of juices to satiate even the most picky of eater i recommend the shrimp or the porkcabbage with a bottle of yellow wine served warm eating here isnt cheap but certainly worth it for a traveler looking for a nice introductory experience of the shanghaiese cuisine, been here so many times if you are nearby and want to taste the best xialongbao in town just checkin and enjoy it i love this place and it is foreign friendly, if you are in shanghai and want to try dumplings and you should this is the place to go service out the wazoo great dumplings and cold beer and wine to boot my gps was wacky trying to find this place but its easy got to the front entrance of the ritz not thru the door  hang a left and just keep going its at the end on your right 104a no kidding go, great food and service and a stones throw from the entry to the ritz the highlight of my whole meal is a steamed cabbage and tomato salad it is so simple yet so wonderful when you are starting to want a break from some of the other typical things you eat when you are on the road around china

there was a lot of attention to detail of the food and service and for that and for its location be prepared to pay a little more than farther down the street from this area but its great for the convenience, is close to the ritz portman ecxelet food attention and dont forget the soft drink of grapfruit and honey, there is a reason that ding tai fung is so popular great consistent food and fantastic service the pork chop is a highlight and so are the dumplings this particular restaurant is not quite as busy so usually you would not need to wait delicious, i often go here when in shanghai cause i love their xiaolongbao esp the ones with pork and black truffle order a glass of red wine with it
they charge 10 service fee but their service is really beyond the level i am used to in china that i happily pay the 10 for example they gave our two year old daughter some dough from the kitchen to play with, first experienced this restaurant here in shanghai and the food was excellent i later found they had a few stores in the states and took my kids to experience the one in redmond area all the dumplings are good i do really like the bean dessert dumplings, we come here every day when in china the service is great the place is spotless and if you find your favourites on the menu you will always get what you want prepared in the same way and never be dissappointed the value for money is good too, great chain restaurants very clean and the side dishes are delicious its not a hong kong style dimsum place so dont expect a great selection of dimsum but the xiaolongbao is really delicious  juicy with very thin wrap my kids  3 and 5  couldnt stop eating them

the service is great our were having a minor tantrum and the waitress gave them some dough and they immediately absorbed in playing the dough its a very simple idea given its a dumpling place but made such a difference for them, following the online recommendation i went for a late lunch with my family ordered a few vegi dishes and xiao long bao the ambiance is better is better than the most of similar restaurants but was not particularly impressed by any food item you wont miss anything if you have no time, you go for the brand like my the reviews the food is great and services are good tea selection is ok and since im not a fussy eater i rate food high in this place, we love coming here ding tai fung is so yummy i would recommend the one in iapm mall which is just down the road as its got a nicer setting but this one is still great, lovely clean food hygiene was amazing so great to be in a quality restaurant great for vegetarians just dont expect great wine, but sometimes things are successful for good reasons we did street food touring and had many good things to eat in shanghai including other street dumplings we loved din tai fung so much that we ate at two locations in shanghai and will make it a point to go to their us location in la next time were out there, all of the dishes were excellent and what we call the soup dumplings were especially good the service was attentive even when the restaurant became busy food came at a good pace a wider variety of choices and better food than the sister restaurant we have been to in sydney australia, must order the normal xiao long bao and the one with crab meat one bao one bite with a bit of ginger and vinegar best way to savour  also try the chicken soup you will not regret excellent service, if i am hungry and looking for a good authentic asian food  this is the chain that i look for whenever i travel to asia it is fast clean and tasty i read that they have been voted as one of the best restaurants in the world in times magazine which i agree except i wouldnt name it a restaurant but i would rather call it qualtiy fast serviced asian food theatre 
highly recommend, ive been to at least three locations and they are consistently good the xiaolongbao are favorites best to try several kinds along with some delicious green vegetables, my boss told me he ate here 4 out of 5 nights he was at the portman ritzcarlton so i cabbed over and can wholeheartedly agree with his opinion over two nights i tried six different dishes and really enjoyed each one definitely worth going out of your way to enjoy, ding tai fung never fails when you want comfort and reliable good quality eats in china taiwan or south east asia the recommended eats are the crab roe dumplings my personal favourite and many other varieties of chinese dumplings and other asian dishes, this came highly rated but i found the experience very similar to some negative others on tripadvisor we arrived at about 9pm website said it was open to 11 and although they gave us a table they stood over us until we ordered as the kitchen was closing would much have preferred to be told that they were closed especially as there was another buzzing restaurant next door also like other reviewers reported they were sold out of most dishes really disappointing, when we arrived at the restaurant there was a lot of people waiting to get seated � this was a good sign

we waited for about 20 minutes which was fine and when we got our table the staff was there to help even though they had a lot of table to service

the food was really great we tried a bunch of different courses and everything tasted perfect

we were really satisfied and would like to go there again we didn�t even know it was a chain restaurant but if the rest is just half as good as this one people are in for a treat, every visit the service and food quality is consistently outstanding it does matter which race you are you will enjoy the food and the environment it is also clean and very fair pricing, this is one of my must haves whenever im in town the dumplings are divine and the plate glass window allows first timers to watch them being made going in a group allows more variety especially given the extensive menu

this location is a little hard to spot but is just beside the entrance to the portman ritz carlton hotel with multiple locations you can probably find one convenient to you without too much trouble, we have been to ding tai fung in singapore taiwan and shanghai we visited this one in shanghai this week and although in a shopping mall it lived up to our expectations clean great food dumplings especially but not a bad thing on the menu although mostly locals this is a place anyone in the world would enjoy, but pricey of course the portions were very small this chain which may be originally from taiwan or singapore is always good the service was good and food always good i have been to the one in singapore and taipei as well taipei was more authentic feeling good place to go if you want good but pricey food  for business where noise not an issue, the atmosphere is typical chinese and the fact that you see the full kitchen active in making xiao long bao makes you feel hungry already at the entrance while waiting for your table
great service great quality may be just a little over price but at the end you are satisfied with what you eat and what you pay for it, its mostly about the xiao long boa we could not find the place and had dinner at another place but chanced upon dtf after dinner my wife and i shared one order of xiao long boa but the waitresses did not mind the place was full but we were willing to wait for 10 15 minutes to be seated, undoubted one of the most relevant example of clean tasty accurate shanghai kind of restaurant
fantastic dumplings marvelously crafted and served recommended even if featured by a logical higher price than the average, this is where i take people to eat xiaolongbao when they visit me in shanghai thin fragile skins break to drown your mouth in soupy goodness and the pork is beautifully seasoned with just the right blend of fat to meat ratio other dishes are ok just go for the xiaolongbao took my parents when they visited they loved it, good lives up to the brand standard for the usual items like xiaolongbao still prefer the singapore branches though especially the one at paragon, this is a restaurant that is exactly what it promises to be simple but tasty food clean place you can see the staff preparing your food and efficient service polite staff who do respond to your calls for service we tried different kinds of doublings pork was the best followed by shrimp and mushroomfilled the least good and also had desserts nonsophisticated but comfortable atmosphere late dinner possible many expatriates among the customers","sport bar",0.999610817289075
170,"linked to the famous m on the bund the glamour bar has a great setting i went twice in a week the first was during a fairly quiet tuesday where i looked out the windows and watch the lights blink off on the bund as it got late it was relaxed and the cocktails were great

my second very brief visit was 3 nights later on a friday it was packed music was booming and i stayed about 2 minutes it definitely had great energy but my colleague who was traveling with me had no interest in such a lively scene so we moved on

in any case it is definitely a cool place to go and depending on what time of vibe you are looking for it can be a chill place or a total scene take your pick of weeknight or weekend, i have been to glam a few times and i always like it from the interior decoration and the beautiful views to the bund to the good service and drinks this especially thanks to the head mixologist blacky who is very dedicated and welcoming always eager for a casual chat about cocktails she makes me feel like at home
on the last 2 visits i chose the coriandertine an havana 7 based cocktail with a very tropical flavour and adorned with a coriander leaf and the lucky candy very mild whisky flavour and garnished with a small piece of turkish candy both were very good drinks and i am looking forward to the next choice the drinks list is extensive and all the bartenders know it well
i accompanied the drinks with some snack bars olives cashewnuts as well as a mushroom ragout that was creamy and tasty and 4 small pieces of truffled sandwich this one was really good and i left craving for more the smell of the truffle is intense and it doesnt disappear in the mouth it is balanced with the exact note of saltiness for a very simple but great taste
really recommend glam for nice and cozy occasion small group of friends couple or on your own i heard that occasionally they also host themed parties that i am sure are fun to enjoy with a bigger group of friends, nice bar downtown at the bund great view and nice interior a little pricy very international guests easy to connect, although this bar is expensive for the bund it is well priced i have been here twice there is cool art  the cocktails are great it is definitely a specialoccasion place the music is great and is played at the perfect level the staff are very attentive  the bathrooms are sensational the tandoorispiced popcorn is a bit confusing but otherwise i have always enjoyed my time at m glam, good service nice atmosphere
vieux carre cocktail was delicious

all the best to the new manager she welcomed me very well, we had a drink at m glam while we waited for our table for m on the bund its a nice bar with wide windows but there is not much of a view of the bund there is nothing too special but allows you to have a drink before dinner i would rather sit at the roof top terrace at m on the bund, friends and i had a mini reunion here the bar is spacious and the place itself is elegant theres a great view of the bund at night and the food is expensive and comes in small portions but good thats expected with the price level the cuisine is very fusion so that also depends on your preference a lot the bathroom is very well decorated and maintained thoughit must be one of the prettiest bathrooms ive ever seen aside from five star hotel bathrooms

overall i would say that if you have a special occasion this is a decent place to go its also a decent place to impress out of town guests but thats really the only reason i would maybe go back again there are plenty of other places on the bund though so consider your budget and choose wisely, very nice cocktail bar on the same floor as the m on the bund restaurant feels very sophisticated good service and of course they serve some very nice cocktails as with all such places its not cheap but then youre paying for the location and ambience, the little sister of fine dining venue m on the bund next door this lounge offers tasty bites and delicious cocktails in a glammed up setting with a sparkly interior and bay windows looking down the bund we loved the lamb and truffle cheese toastie, a nice complement to m on the bundgood for a drink after dinner or a quiet chat any timepleasant but unobtrusive staff were a bonus, interesting looking after our dinner at m on the bund  a group of us joined in this nice ambience for one last drink and view of the bund before we separate ways for the evening, if you are looking for something a little different near the bund then this is the place for you i went there the other day with some colleagues from work for their happy hour for cocktails and had an absolute brilliant time you do need to make a reservation in advance the food is mainly finger food to accompany the drinks but the quality was first rate and the service from the staff both in mandarin and in english was polite and quick the quality of the alcohol in shanghai can be a little bit like russian roulette at times but this definitely is not one of those places, glam bar is an extraordinary place worldwide

sophisticated freak busy with real art funny and crunchy but elegant
it has a genius loci an unique touch a personality

it is best place in town for having a conversation a business meeting or a date as music is never too loud
it is also the place to show you are different and you like great drinks
get there after 11 and it turns in dark superrelaxed intimate mood

by afternoon it runs quartet music poetry or movie festivals that is also damn rare in town

all of this being relaxed comfortable welcoming unpretentious

i could go every day actually ive been for all mys tay in town, glam bar  now moved to a new floor but still great fun and fine view highly recommended bar food is tasty and service sharp great views and ambiance i went here early on a mid week night and it was quiet at first  but quickly warmed up i will definitely be back, we went here on a monday night and were consistently disappointed the place was only 20 full and lots of staff on hand and only 2 other tables around us for the evening the staff poured beer in our foaming glass and it totally spilled over ruining the paper table mats and getting on to the pants of a guest then we were charged an extra 200 rmb out of a 1300 rmb bill for two people finally we had a coat tag with a letter and the person took a comically long time trying to find the coat even popping into m on the bund next door overall just a bad experience and there are better options on the bund to take guests pop mr  mrs bund jean george and impress or hang out for a chill evening house of roosevelt or rockbund area, the glam bar on the bund is one of my favorite places to go the service is magnificent and the atmosphere is sublime there is a feeling of the new and the old its vibrant decor and dynamic character make it the most interesting place to be for cocktails and light snacks the food is fantastic the chef hamish has out done himself creating unique melt in your mouth finger foods i highly recommend visiting glam and enjoying a cocktail while you discuss your wonderful time in shanghai stop over at m just next door for an unforgettable dinner and a photo op on the balcony, well
this is is surely the most interesting place ive been in town
great food great view unique decor welcoming and professional staff
i suggest coming here alldaylong food is intriguing and tasty cocktails range from classics to funny and surprising

best for me anyway is coming for an intimate late evening chat, the glamour bar previously located on the 6th floor of this building was closed last year now glam bar has opened on the 7th floor same level as m on the bund beautiful views nice bar, always love this place always playing great upbeat house music lots of exciting performances from club dancers to laser wielding robots fun bars and one of the most stunning patiosbalcony views of the bund a must see and do if you are hunting for contemporary shanghai nightlife, great view great service there is some confusion about whether this bar is open  apparently one by the same name used to be located here closed and reopened recently under new ownership anyway we were there january 2016 and its right next to m on the bund same floor same building and we had a wonderful late night snack with cocktails overlooking the bund super glamorous, went here twice in a week because i loved it so much both times with a friend
there was a wide choice of cocktails and the ones that i tried were delicious  including a mixandmatch gin  tonic menu
there was a variety of small dishes to share and we loved every single one that we ordered each dish was so tasty in a different way and often quite rich but since the portions were small and to share it was not overpowering and allowed you to experience many tastes over the course of a meal
the view of the bund was just beautiful and the decor was eccentric and fabulous it was quite pricey for shanghai but understandably so due to the location and the quality of the food and drinks served, delicious bites served sharing style you can order as you go and we definitely ordered multiple dishes a couple of times some wonderful combinations of asian flavours mixed with traditional european fare the setting is unpretentious and our service was very good must try  prawn popcorn spiced pork bites thai tah tah  duck dome pie, great place to hang out in a funky setting with a great list of cocktails  the champagne cocktails are highly recommended, cocktails are not good
no alcohol
my cocktail was warm
cannot smoke cigar
staff is not nice
place is expensive
decoration is good though and location perfect, went there with a group of 5 for dinner and cocktails drinks options were good  including being able to order cocktails off the menu food options were sufficiently broad to include tapasshare type plates to a la carte we ordered a la carte and all enjoyed our meals i didnt have dessert but others did and they looked pretty amazing atmosphere service and views were all outstanding highly recommend this for a trendy night out that is still relaxing at the same time in my opinion the price was fine for the standard and the views of the bund, went there for drinks and late dinner a bit costly but the food is amazing service is also quite good and the view is perfect, just reopened space next door to m same floor excellent selection snacks and cocktails good service good management and oh what a cool design vibe well done, really comfortable restaurant and bar to bring clients or friends food to share which is great to interact with friends and business associates alike full shared menu available at any seat so just settle in  but make a reservation amazing view of the bund out the big windows filled with art and you will have to walk about to take it all in rich colors of furnishings and wallsceiling sexy spot to hang out  very glam indeed, great cocktail bar with a mixologist thats passionate about his art just next to m on the bund large windows with a brilliant view over the huangpu river and its associated skyline nice  small tapas plenty of locals and expats in here liked the wrapped pork and triangles oysters were small and a little light compared with what were used to, great bar on the same floor as m comfy chairs a nice view good staff and a great old fashioned  with rosemary , after 8 years of ups and downs this iconic place has finally closed good memories for many expats and locals back in those years we had to queue up even after midnight and the music and atmosphere was great it really went down hill in the recent years, very hip stylish and atmosphere crowded with expats good place for friends or business associates book early to get a table with view, a great bar to relax and hold a conversation in gorgeous views professional staff good cocktails and loved the cheeseplate a truly hip spot, this is a stylish and very hip place for the upmarket professional with great views in particular from the terrace in a lovely colonial art deco building great decor excellent service and drinks a place to chill out or for unwinding we had numerous snacks platters and drinks excellent all round, part of the m on the bund group and in bund 5 this is an elegant bar overlooking the river and the pudong skyline very attractive cool space went to a medoc tasting this friday great staff great service great views and the 8 wines were quite tasty too can be early or late night with also great tunes this is a place to hang in shanghai, great view from this very trendy shanghai bar not over expensive but even so probably best to sip your drinks, glamour bar is located downstairs from m on the bund as we didnt get a table with a window view at m we decided to check out the bar for drinks and a view luckily we did manage to get a window seat here the view was nice although its below m so you can only get a river view and the drink selection was pretty good i had a belgian beer which isnt always easy in asia the house lemonade was too sweet for my taste but is probably good if you do have a sweet tooth recommended for a drink before or after dinner at the m, great old world feel about this place with a bar situated in the middle of a large room surrounded by comfortable seating with tables visual access to the bund through windows and also a narrow balcony at one side with good music makes it an enjoyable location with friends drinks a little pricey but similar to other hotel bars  restaurants in the vicinity, good drinks nice view good atmosphere a definite visit to shanghai located on the bund and overlooking pudong the place is upscale and expensive, we popped in here for late evening drinks and had a couple of cocktails the service is good and the feel of the place is funky and effortless if you can get a seat by the front windows then the view of the city is amazing and you could spend all night watching until they turn the city lights off just after 11pm

its just nice for drinks and relaxing i havent eaten here and i dont think i would either its more a bar and chill our venue for me, if youre able to get a table its quite a good place to sit and drink some tsingtao and enjoy the views we went on a saturday night and got a table loved it will come back, great selection of cocktails and lovely atmosphere view over bund is good too we did set menu with a light bite and cocktail which was good value french fries are also delicious as covered in garlic great toilets too no need for loo paper, nice bar good view however the seating was a little bit awkward  too much space between the different sears chaiselongue to speak naturally a bit too bright, whether you have time for dinner at m on the bund or not you should definitely hit the glamour bar for a drink excellent, beware of fake taxis when leaving here youre better off walking to a reputable hotel for a taxi if youre a foreigner and dont want to pay double, in a cool building on the bund on the fourth floor i believe with great nighttime views of modern shanghai the furniture is a mix of colorful tapestry that includes contemporary and traditional chairs and tables in an ample spacious setting the bar sits essentially in the middle and any and every drink imaginable can be hadthe drinks are very very expensive while i did not sight any celebrities it is said that it is commonplace to see one, we came here for a drink early in the evening so i cannot comment on how busy it gets later on we got a table overlooking the river and very much enjoyed watching the sun set over pudong my husband had a ginger mojito and i had a nonalcoholic glamourade both were very well made the decor was very pink but pleasant and the service was attentive, flooded with expats and a few locals and very crowded on a saturday night limited view of the bund and overpriced drinks$9$10 for a small local beernice decor, very stylishmodern bar in an old building with big windows overlooking the bund drinkscocktails are good but of course pricy music was good and staff attentive and friendly definitely a great place to have a few drinks, overlooking the h river from a bund historic building this bar is a must for a nice predinner cocktail or two

the decor is fantastic and we had a very quiet time sipping our drinks and listening to nice music while rain was pouring down outside

service is very careful and they bring a lot of munchies","Turkish cuisine",0.82614703705236
171,"if you want hotpot this is probably the place to come great food great service just make sure you avoid rush hour, excellent evening in shanghai alana wu was an excellent guide the food was delicious and the views beautiful, very good chinese hotpot with large choice of hotpot and meals to put in good place to go for couples friends and with family different table size according to your group this haidilao hotpot brand is my favourite in shanghai that place is great also because there is massage place just below the restaurant, go local and do hidilao there are many in shanghai and the rest of china not too easy and no english but the staff will get you sorted first order your broth you can go half and half so mushroom and chilli are a good option for a group of authenticity seekers and those who dont like spice then order your meat fish and veg and tofu these can all be half orders and unless there are more than 4 of you should be order about 2 dishes a person but dont go with less than 3 people ask for the noodles and you get a dancing man i reccomment the tofu and quails eggs lotus root and scallops great in the middle of the night, what a fun way to have dinner mix your own source dunk whatever fish meat vegetables into a fragrant broth and cook it yourself always excellent service and fantastic fresh produce not to mention it is open for 24hrs
we love it went there twice highly recommended especially if you have never tried it before, this was an amazing meal from service to quality to experienceoh yeah and taste i deducted one point for their ordering system an ipad im sure if you knew mandarin it would be easily explained how to use but as none of the staff had english any better than me mandarin it left me frustrated trying to use however the staff were really really great we all had a good laugh trying to speak in a combination of garbled mandarin and english hey haidilao please come to canada there is a whole market ripe for picking, incredible service great food in terms of variety and quality and a very entertaining experience we would recommend to anyone visiting shanghai, ive been to this place before and i thought that the food was good before they didnt let me down this place has great food on the menu including lots of options for bullfrog pretty tasty, not easy to find but well worth the trip entertaining outstanding wait staff incredible customer service and the food was terrific, although less spicy than the chengdu original the legendary hotpot at hai di lao is delicious as is their equally legendary predinner waiting services nail salon playroom free plum juice and snacks the service is perfect  even including a plastic ziplock to protect your phone from oil splashes, hot pot is a chinese classic everyone sits around the pot that ha soup in it and you cook the stuff when you please and the way you please haidilao knows their job

remember when we went with the family the price was ok but the food was really amazing the soup stock is wonderful and properly done both the traditional and spicy pots are good
the variety of sauces are great and everything is just there at your disposal
the kung fu la mian kung fu noodles are the most aldente noodles i have ever eaten in my life just dont overcook em yourself and they are called kung fu noodles for a reason prepare yourself for a flashy show by the noodlemaster as he turns a ball of dough into beautifully done la mian

the ingredients are fresh an clean they are served fast and the staff is friendly enough but most importantly do their job well

i really recommend this place for any kind of dinner family friends even business if you are close enough
clean beautifully decorated you got some computers and a beauty salon just in case and the food as said amazing

1010 if i ever get the chance to visit shanghai one more time haidilao is already in the list, went to the shanghai branch which located at the nanjing west road nanjing xi lu for dinner a huge place and we are lucky that we got a seat immediately as we did not make reservation the place was fully occupied although it is on weekday

this is the only place that ive to said thank youxie xie multiple times to the waiter due to their excellent services
they will run towards u with ni hao each time once you raise your hand
each time you passby any waiter they will smile and greet you
they even have a fulltime employee standing at the washing area to open the water tap and provide you the paper towel

an apron for you to wear if you are a butter fingers like me
a lens wipe is given if you are wearing glasses
a rubber scrunchies is given if you had a long hair
hot towel were given twice
complimentary of soup sunflower seeds and tea at the end of the meal
for the ladies free manicure you can resume your food after manicure but unfortunately the queue is too long for me to wait 

food wise is alright they have a wide choice of sauce free flow of fruits and condiments i love their white fungus soup

and all this for only 300++rmb for 3 persons, its a truly good value for money the hotpot here is economical staff was exceptionally great and helpful they always deliver the best service they use ipads for menu and ordering and assign a particular waiter to serve your table, i was taken here by my chinese work colleagues and it was my first hot pot experience in china and great fun it was too a real bonus was the english translation on ipad for us foreigners it helped  the majority of diners are probably locals whist i had a little trepidation at trying some of the more exotic dishes  which i did  it was all part of the experience would definitely do it again best as a group of 4 or more and certainly not expensive, it�s an extremely busy hot pot place but don�t worry some of the brunch runs 24 hours which means you have plenty of time to eat hot pot when you are waiting they provide the popcornfruit tea for you other than that you can do your manicure gentleman can have their shoes polish which you couldn�t experience anywhere in china nor the place i had ever been else where
when you sat your bagcoat will be covered and offer you a whip if you are wearing the glasses now they are using ipad to choose the dishes which is very handy after that you can go to the other areas to pick up the appetizer fruits and mixed your owned sauce one thing you need to order is �handmade noodle � which the waiter will show the skill in front of you with some dance move which really got everybody�s attention
overall this is the place where you can experience the good food clean environment and excellent service this company really did their training well to practice the service attitude, one of my favorite restaurants in china i can always count on a good meal and entertainment they have ipad menus in english which is rare for any hot pot restaurantamazing its also a fun place to bring the foreign visitors for their first hot pot experience, the menu was quite limited compared to the other steamboat restaurants we have in singapore their attraction may perhaps be due to the excellent service manicuremassage services to keep you distracted while you wait

we chose the pork bone soup base and it came with huge bones that you can suck bone marrows with a straw after you boil it this was not to our liking as it was quite a turn off to see the huge bones sitting on the table

the other base we chose was the mushroom one which was quite refreshing it came with assorted mushrooms

we also ordered the handmade noodle and it was quite a show when the staff came out and pulled the noodle right next to your table

they also had an excellent sauce station where you can mix your own sauces

will not return, ive never been to a hotpot restaurant so it was very interesting to me i wish someone there had been able to explain in english how it all worked and what the different cooking liquids actualy were we may have made better choices we ordered 2 cooking liquids  one a super super super spicy roast chilli and szechwuan peppercorn beef tallowoil and the other a mushroom broth all ordering is done on the ipad and it is in english although still a little hard to work out what you need we ordered beef brisket cabbage hand made noodles mushrooms dumplings bamboo shoots and these all came to the table and we cooked them in the pots then there is a long bar of condiments although i needed guidance as to what would be the best i chose the flavours that i knowchives chilli mustard soy vinegara little boring perhaps once we worked out which cooking liquid we liked etc and what condiments go with it it was really delicious would definitely go back and they offer a free manicure with lunch, by unique i meant pig brains pig throat goats liveretc etc etc i was shocked by the menu but i assure you they serve the normal food if you are not there for a crazy gastronomic experience

lots of people has described what good services they have let me list some which i experienced and saw free flow of drinks and dessert spectacles cleaning machine and wipes hair ties to prevent my hair getting into the soup toothbrush and toothpaste in the toilets free sanitary pads if you require board games to play with free snacks before and after mealand the waiter doubles as a babysitter too

verdict it feels good to be pampered, the service here was great there was everything what you could think of even free manicure the food was good as well nice concept enjoyable atmosphere tastfull food and good prices, we visited this hai di lao outlet at beijing west rd shanghai on the 8th of april 2014 and were attended to by their staff going by the name of xiao ling zi he was very friendly explained and assisted us with food ordering and was very attentive to us because of his great service we wanted to tip him however he humbly turned us down saying that it was against his principle to accept tips and that it was his pleasure to assist us

the food was really good we mainly had their beef lamb and beef meat balls we took two different soup bases their twin hot pot one of which is spicy and both were great there was a sauce corner and refillable drinks  their sour plum drink was good there was also a mini showcase from a chef when you order noodles

the staff were very attentive there was a lady who was handling out warm towels to clean our hands and even a staff situated at the washroom

the price was very reasonable we paid about 680 rmb for 6 pax we were all full at the end of the meal overall we had an enjoyable night and we all agreed that this was one of best meals in shanghai  the food and particularly the service standard was top notch and we would highly recommend this place for a visit, the first thing to say about this is that the service here is unbelievable really not what youd expect with a hot pot place and whilst i am no hot pot fan i lived in chongqing for three years and had enough to last me a lifetime the unique selling point of this place  its phenomenal service  almost makes hot pot edible, nice  clean hot pot restaurant with very good service and food is both efficient and quick in service and the staff friendly  they like to provide some entertainment at times too as we saw a group of the staff dancing and singing for a birthday guest and one waiter likes to go around twirling the long strands of pasta they give you an apron so no worries about getting your clothes messy and if you want before or after you could have a manicure as they have a station set up at the entrance also there is a play area for the kids  computers to play on and games to play the price is not too bad either and we would definitely return again, you dont just come here for great hotpot at reasonable prices you come here to experience true hospitality in china sounds weird not really but good service with a smile is not common at all in china here the customer comes first my partner is a muslim which can be tricky when eating out in china not here the menu is clearly marked with muslim friendly items they even put a green sign on your table to make sure the right food is delivered to you if you need a drink which is not stocked such as diet coke they offer to go to the local supermarket for you if your phone needs charging they will take it to a secure charging locker for you going to the toilet is a pleasure the facilities are spotless and the attendant will even moisturize your hands for you the food comes in healthy sized portions it is fresh and the service is quick if you have never eaten hotpot before they will show you what to do i cannot fault this restaurant on either its food or service try it, the service staff are so welcoming each greeting you on entry and exit our waitress helped us pick and cook the ingredients she was so friendly and thoughtful presenting us with aprons camera sleeve and hair tie we chose the clear broth and it flavoured the meat and vegetables well many tables had half clear broth and half spicy broth sauce station was neat and a delight for those who like to personalise their dipping sauce the only downside is passive smoking throughout your meal this is not a problem restricted to this restaurant the toilet is squat style but there is a service staff to turn on the tap for you and hand you a towel to dry your hands, at my first three days in shanghai im not immpressed at all with their service quality but some friends brought me hereand then this restaurant become my most favoritemost recomendedgreatest service quality in shanghai am i too much haha but thats what i feel
when we were waiting to get tables they provide free snack and you can take as much as you wantlike fried nutscherry tomatoorangeetc they also provide free shoes polish and for you the girlsfree nail arts
they asked us to cover our jacket so it wouldnt smell like hotpot afterward and when you go to the toiletsomeone will press the soap butten for you so your hands wont get dirty againgive you a warm toweltissue and hand cream
they are agilekindpolite and always smile my friend left his shopping bagthey gave it back in some restoif you left something it will dissappear
the food we ordered use two kind of soup baseone spicy anthe other mushroom soup the spicy one contain much oilbut tasted good we ate so much untill our stomach was really full and couldnt eat food anymore we love it and immpresed even if the taste isnt goodtheir kindness make the food tasted good haha
we ate 8 people5male 3women cost 62person and stomach was really full we order mostly meat we left about 3 dishes untouchgave it to our friends at the next table so worthed, i would like to mark it as perfect however the only problem is the language chinese only this hot pot chain restaurant is probably the best service you can experience ever in china it is so popular so mostly you have to wait but is it not a big deal at all you get free snacks and board games to kill your waiting time and they offer shoe clean service and free internet access and for ladies there is free nail polishing too if you want to eat something but they dont have it on menu dont hesitate to ask mostly they will get it for you we tried dumpling and icecream friendly to vegetarian and muslim mostly the pot is with chicken or pork soup but they have it marked for muslims on menu and as a vegetarian you can ask them to prepare it with water dont miss the noodle it is tasty and very enjoyble and the noodle master will entertain you more if you show how much you like it this noodle is entertaining as turkish icecream
most of its stores close at 300 am for those in city center open 24h, the decor of hai di lao is nothing impressive at all it is a big restaurant with many tables each table has a hot pot of its own and you can select which soup or soups you want in the hotpot which is used for boiling your food you can go to a communal area and make your own dipping sauce for the hotpot there is also a guy who comes around stretch dancing the noodles at your table
the prices are higher than some other hotpots but still not high prices and the service is good the only problem is that the service is only in chinese
i recommend this restaurant for an authentic chinese experience, i will not talk to much about hotpot meals here now as the concept is probably well know to you the food is of good quality and we were offered a tour around their kitchen and saw how clean and healthy is all is prepared instead i will talk about the service concept that

it starts with the door man waiting for you and welcoming you with a big smile or even offering you a free raincoat when you leave another person waiting for you at the elevator and welcoming you again if your table is not ready they offer you snacks and drinks manicure shoe shining laptops with wifi in the lobby all for free actually i wanted to have my shoes shined but our table was ready so i asked them to do this after we finished our meal and they did with a smile picking up my bag from the floor and putting it on a table the waiter was almost like a personal butler only a nod or look away even the restroom attendants and table cleaners turned their work into a good customer experience all staff seemed to take great pride in their work and did sterling jobs when you order fresh kung fu noodles the chef comes out and gives you a noodle gymnastics band demonstration

this is guest experience and customer service to the max

oh yeah the also come to your hous ewith a hotpot and food and will come back to take it away and clean up your table amazing

we paid 290 rmb for 3 people and thought that they made a mistake but it was true, this place is a favourite amongst locals and is known for its service and efforts towards cleanliness from the getgo if you have to wait for a table they will direct you to a seating area and serve you snacks to tide you over in addition you can get a free shoe shine or massage while you wait and theres free wifi at the restaurant

you dont get the personal hot pots like most other restaurants ie you have to share one pottwo soup bases in the middle but its fine for a gathering with friends and family the meat and vegetables are fresh the lapulled noodles that are stretched in front of you in an entertaining fashion are really good and the staff are very attentiveit almost feels like youve got a personal attendant on hand

your bags and cellphones are covered and you can even wear an apron if you desire theres a good selection of sauces for you to select from as well

the prices are in line with the other highend hot pot restaurants and reservations are highly recommended as they get super busy, the best service you will ever expect to see in shanghai bar none even 5star hotels could learn from them i put my phone on table come back and its wrapped so it doesnt get dirty

after staying in china for so long you come to expect bad service but this place is a slice of heaven

and while we are at it their foo is excellent too make sure to get the handmade noodles he will make it in front of you an dance too","dumpling restaurant",0.880426167128339

good mix of cantonese and shanghai dim sum taste was good everything looked clean and staff was helpful also the standard has been consistent, excellent hong kong style dishes i tried the hong kong style sweet and sour pork their soup was very good, service was friendly and food was decent of the standard expected i especially like the old shanghai deco bringing back good memories, this was my last meal in shanghai before i left absolutely delicious my favourite was the pork belly rolls in a chilli soy dressingsee pic everything was scrumptious surprising for a restaurant in a hotel the shanghai dumplings were the tastiest i had in my time there i wish i could try more dishes maybe next time, a good surprise with the quality of the food and services nothing different than what i usually hv in hongkong at similar or lower price we ordered the soy chicken pork n fried rice which all are good
will certainly recommend this place to my fellow fren in shanghai only for the fb but not the hotel room stay , very nice restaurant with very good food the restaurant wine consultant was second to none she was more informative than any other consultant we have ever metshe was a breath of fresh air and so very knowledgable , visited many times used to like their dim sum but standard seems like not as good as it used to be the roasted pigeon was great ambiance was nice service is good too nice place for dim sum recommended to come for their dim sum during high tea time on weekend20 discount and no need reservation, had a few hours to spend before going to the airport and our local friends took me to this exquisite restaurant very nice ambient and the food was very good, interesting and really yummie food convenient and easy to understand how to orderif you are staying at the new world hotel it is up stairs in the lobby, in the penta hotel this restaurant serves very delicate food in a modern colonial style atmosphere friendly and efficient staff free high speed internet access very recommended, ive been going to this restaurant for the last 6 months with my family almost every sunday its our sunday dim sum place and a really good one too the service is impeccable and the food is remarkable the only bad thing is their napkins which leave a ton of white bits on your pants, casual hongkongmacau dishes with nice and comfortable interior the restaurant is a part of penta hotel or new world hotel so that they charge 10 service fee but the service deserve 10 extramanager speaks english
all dished we ordered were fine but 150200 yuen per person is little expensive
although outside sign shows dimsum picture they serve them only for lunch time menu is written is chines and english but no pictures, superb dim sum excellent attentive  professional service which was the best i experienced in my whole stay in shanghai in a relaxed dining room im from the food  beverage industry  would hire every single member of staff that served me without a second thought, for authentic cantonese cuisine search no more try yue1525 in the new world hotel next to changning park it is a beautiful restaurant not your typical chinese restaurant and it serves the best dim sum you can imagine when it comes to dim sum lunch we have a bit of experience after 12 years on hong kong but yue1525 beats even the hong kong standards the service good english skills is attentive the price extremely reasonable and every time i have been to the restaurant i have been amazed by the quality and value for money dinner is great also and worth tryingthe sweet and sour pork is fantastic, the dishes were all delicious and pretty much as good as their equivalents in hong kong price was rather middling possibly not by shanghai standards but a little expensive compared to beijing, the restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the penta hotel next to the new world hotel formerly the mayfair hotel and it is a spacious modern dining room with the experience we have had i can say that this is one of the best dim sum restaurants in town the food is high quality and surprisingly wellpriced dim sum is offered during lunch time but especially during weekends a reservation is a must staff is very attentive good and helpfull, food quality excellent and variety great staff very at tentative  i had 3 meals at this restaurant since i know that i wont be let down, this is the only chinese restaurant i visit when i am in the zhongshan park area reliable and consistent good service and quality a variety of typical dim sum dishes at reasonable prices which is only served during lunch the standard fares like prawn dumplings charsiew buns are wellexecuted very fresh due to the fast turnover tasty and authentic too you would see business groups and wellheeled families professionallymanaged and fast service despite the busy lunch time crowds definitely recommended if you are in the area","bar",0.489460694749151
174,"one of the nicest wine bars in shanghai great staff wide choice of wine affordable pricing and great snacks i like it a lot and every time i come back to shanghai i make sure to have a nice evening with dr wine, really fun and quality wine bar in a vibrant area of the former french concession good choice of wines from around the world and friendly staff, the wine bar is quite small but comfortable with a small bar and lounge area very comfortable

internally it is quite modern and chic in an understated way western in style

patrons are a mix of expats and locals quite an upmarket crowd

wine prices not too bad and there are some tasty bar snacks and ham and cheese plates

i believe there is a restaurant upstairs but i havent tied it

if you want a civilised evening out this is your place i shall be returning for more than a few times while here in shanghai

staff are good a mixture of local and expat english not a problem service was good the bar food i had very good the placed seemed clean and well maintained, this place is perfect for date night large and small groups i went here on a first date and the atmosphere was great for it we had a bottle and a few glasses of wine and shared a delicious cheese plate i really like the ambience here and will go back again for sure, came here with a friend this evening great service promptly seated and first orders taken glasses were refilled quickly and constantly the food was superb as well we had the salmon pizza and the tartines to share super yummy obviously the yhave a great selection of wines something for every price bracket wine by the glass starts out at around 40rmb and bottles around 200rmb

great ambiance will definitely go again, stopped here for a drink on the way out for dinner nice selection of wines beers and spirits at average prices for the area nice atmosphere food menu also looked good would like to go back and try, wine it is but its also many other things the staff are well trained which makes the service second to none in shanghai high praise i know but they deserve it the attraction for us is the oysters slightly addictive and always delicious the ambience is tightly packed industrial but has uniques little rooms spaces where small groups 68 can hang out as you would in a living room at home the wine menu is well thought out with a large scope and reasonable depth to the management an resounding well done and please keep up the good work see you next week, really enjoy this place  a mixed chinese  expat crowd with a nice vibe on a friday night upstairs restaurant with tightly packed tables and downstairs bar which you can eat at good pizza antipasta and a pretty extensive wine list fumin lu is a road with lots of options so you can wander from here, i like the bar a lot the owner is very friendly and knows french the wine selection very food all by the glass and served cold the chinese staff dont speak a lot which is sad i like staff that talks to me at a bar the food very good especially if just finger food is required and all western i did not like chinese food nice french cheese etc perfect with winethe only thing that bothers me is that the ventilation is not working good after s visit i obliged to wash my clothes as it smells from kitchen, we went to dr wine in the french concession last saturday night and got there around 900pm it was a fun environment with a bar downstairs as well as upstairs there are many little clusters of seats so you can sit with friends and enjoy a drink and some food the challenge was we couldnt find a seat and ended up leaving to go somewhere else ill definitely return but wanted to let you know to get there early, ok the place is quite pretty  love the decoration  table are ok  food dont expect super gastronomic place  but the worst is a smoking  when you dont smoke and you want to enjoy wine  also the service is very low  waiters are to novice  i put 3 for no put 2  but please try to give a better communication between the waiters and really need a no smoking area but separate no like you do   i hope i can try again see if change happen , for an italian being able to travel to south east asia and far east and having options fo really good wines is a massive plus love the place the staff is very polite and a few european guys are quite knowledgeable re the wines the y sell and the small food selection fingertips and pizza are definitely of good quality not enough to call this a restaurant, after a long day if you want to relax with your friends or your lover in a nice and simple place go to dr wine an honest choice of wines and snacks a fast service and reasonable prices, i went to dr wine to celebrate a friends birthday we were given the largest table in the restaurant upstairs the wine and food are reasonably priced and very enjoyable i shared a pizza and a salad with the birthday girl and it was really good food they have a wide selection of wines the atmosphere was cosy and intimate the interior is beautiful i would definitely recommend a visit, wanted to get a quick simple bit this was the place they seem to have a good selection quick bites kind of stuff more of finger food but more western and trendy in nature if recall we had something similar to chicken fingers for appetizers they do have nice selection of beers a small sample to try different stuff a good place to just hang out and have a quick meal, cozy little place to hang out with friends good selection of wines by the glass or bottle and appetizers it has a larger dining area upstairs that we did not try downstairs area has large bar and area with several couches and tables, ive been here many times this is a good place to hangout with friends and a good glass of wine food has never been great but ok when you want a bite to go with that wine, this is a great place on fumin lu very comfortable really nice atmosphere upstairs is cosy but as someone else mentioned it does get very busy especially later in the week

the food platters are very good the cheese and hams especially but not cheap at 185 but enough food for at least 2 people the pizzas are also good and its nice that the food is sharing but unlike most tapas dishes the portions of the bigger dishes are quite large

my personal reason for loving this place is the wine and the price of it there is a good choice from all over the world to my taste a very nice chardonnay and my favourite prosecco belstartry it if you like a nice dry bottle of bubbles plus its 100 rmb cheaper than the same bottle in the shanghai brewery so much better value

service is good attentive without being overbearing and plenty of staff when you need a refill

personally much prefer it to its sisterbrother dr beer further down fumin lu

only small drawback is that it does indeed allow smoking wish they would just make the tables near the windows smoking so you might be a bit smelly when you leave, a fantastic place to taste good wine and spend some good time the place is warm either at the bar or in the sophas around the wine list is very good at a reasonable price the food is good too , great place in french concession to have a drink the place is usually pretty busy
downstairs is a bar and upstairs is more like a restaurant with tables the place is very small so better make a reservation on forehand food is nice and so is the wine as smoking is allowed in bars and restaurants for sure you go home smelly
usually a place for westenersexpats, tapas bar nice atmosphere music a bit loud friendly staff reasonably priced well located so enjoy with your fiends , really cozy winebar with a great selection of wine the tapas food are very tasty and just right for the wine the interior is nice and cozy  nice to be siting among lots of wine bottles the only minus i can find is when you ask for ice water they serve you tap water  that is not okay in an winebar of course they have real water on the menu  but most decent places you get nice filtered water if you ask for ice water, enjoyed several wines and tasteful charcuterie platter on a wednesday evening with my partner whilst visiting shanghai we needed a break from local food and dr wine was a real treat ambience was nice and service was very good by the time we left the venue was starting to swell with patrons so definitely a popular place highly recommend, we had been to dr beer so we were keen to try dr wine and we werent disappointed it had been a very cold and wet day so dr wine was a warm and cosy place for dinner after walking through rain on the bund the pizzas were excellent especially the black seafood pizza made with squid ink the salads were very good too and made a nice change from our predominantly chinese diet the wind was good and not crazy prices definitely worth trying if you need a break from local food, this is a really great place very cozy and the food is totally outstanding we ordered 6 different dishes and they were all so good i will definitely go back in the first floor you have a bar second floor you have the restaurant, i been already in this place many times the first time it was normal seat tables after that i discovered a vip room private small room with 2 sofa for max 46 peoples
need to book the private room because most of the time busy the manager matthieu very attentive the only suggestion as italian  maybe some more italian wine choise in the menu for all the rest if fantastic place for spend few moment and drink good wine, very nice atmosphere in the french concession  after dr beer comes dr wine  nice pizza and french and australian wine somewhere to go with friends  and also a nice bar, if you like the wine this is your bar wide wine menu in order to enjoy wines around the worls close environment with the most cool people from shanghai, obviously came here for the promise of a good wine selection but actually ended up staying for a couple of hours because of the lovely snacks they serve i would particularly recommend the goats cheese and ed onion bruchetta plus the cheese fondue this is definitely a new favourite place, following a recommendation we went for a quick wine glass early evening and we ended up staying three and half hours
the place is divided in two levels ground at street level with an upstairs with large windows and warm wooden design
its basically a very good place to hang out drink wine at almost reasonable price for shanghai while having bites to eat
essentially it is not a restaurant and i was very happy about it
the ambient is darken enough and the music cool and not too loud
my favorite place in shanghai so far take your partner and wont be disappointed, been in shanghai for two years and cant believe we havent been to dr wine before great wine selection with lovely bites order as much or as little as you like service spot on which is sadly a rarity busy by the time we left at 2145 on a friday evening so maybe get there earlyish, went there in the evening during the week and was surprised with the fact that it was packed with people upstairs is more crowdy and noisy so we chose to sit downstairs at the bar had some nice wine prices are ok nice choice of music

the bar is nicely decorated very original and we really felt good there

did not eat there so cannot say how the food is

minus even though the name of the bar they do not have very large choice of wine which one would expect, a regular haunt round the corner from home  very friendly service simple menu of bar food snacks pizza and salads  reasonable selection of wine and all at great prices

never disappoints, on a recent trip to shanghai i stopped here two times once was a saturday afternoon the other a saturday night on the saturday afternoon there was only one other table with customers however the saturday night we needed to take two seats for 3 people at a shared table we only had glasses of wine on the afternoon and a bottle on the evening visit glasses of wine are reasonably priced with decent but notable quality i would say the same for our bottle selection no complaints or compliments for service crowd was a mixture of age groups both foreign and domestic atmosphere is good other than i would say it is a bit tight not exactly a relaxing place for a glass of wine however if u=you are looking for drinks in a popular spot you cannot wrong here, went there on a friday night with some friends very busy place good service large wine selection with reasonable prices very tasty bruschetta and pizza good place to hang around with friends, recently visited dr wine with my wide for a quiet evening as the children were at the bruno mars concert
we chose dr wine as we had not been there for a while and were not disappointed
the place was very busy when we arrived and i would advise to book ahead to get a table as by 745 the place was full
for the wine we ordered the reliable nz sauvignon blanc this was served well chilled and the service was prompt and efficient all good signs for what was to come
we ordered the cheese and ham platter that seemed better than before we also had the chicken satay these were the nicest pieces of chicken we can remember and combined with the lively sauce they hit the spot the second bottle arrived at this point we moved to the ham and mushroom pizza was cooked to our liking and light and tasty to eat
all the food was served by the busy staff in almost no time this was a difference to our last visit where had to leave before the food arrived
we have visited dr wine many times over the past 5 years and always provides great value wine and food it is good to see the place busy and the service is spot on i cant understand why we do not go there more often, a cafe that has been open for while specializing in french wines and country french food over 100 varieties of wine are on offer atmosphere is laid back shanghaiprices are reasonable to crazy for the wine and very reasonable for the food very well decorated in the style of an old used french country house well worn after 7 years of crowds staff is helpful and attentive just what the dr ordered","bar",0.553556289361425

chalet bar and grill
english menu reasonable prices offering lots of dishes like pasta burgers sandwiches steak chinese food

dishes averaged about 50120rmb

fast service staff spoke english

i had the beef curry it was very tasty, have really enjoyed happy hour here the last few nights 58pm every day drinks reasonably priced become really quite cheap cocktails are spot on and the staff friendly 2 tv screens playing all sorts of sports and good background music food menu looked good, great friendly staff good menu and a brilliant atmosphere a little oasis amonst the madness that is shanghai denis and justin are really helpful and the free pool table is a hit with the customers even though denis is hard to beat, first of all i commend them on their staff service and design of the restaurant

after being in shanghai for a while the prices were quite expensive but we wanted to give it a try we ordered a ceaser salad and a fried rice soon after i ordered a iced green tea which is essentially just green tea with ice in it the ceaser salad was nice  but the fried rice was bland with a few ham chucked in there ice tea tasted like it was a different kind of tea

when it came to getting the bill i noticed that they charged me for a earl grey tea for 35yuan  thats abit over $6aud for a freaking tea with ice in it  even in australia i would pay a maximum of $3aud it was my mistake for not looking at the drink menu price but honestly i never expected a tea drink to be that costly couldve gotten atleast 3 milk teas outside  overall we paid about almost $40aud

for the value for money with the dishes and prices  i felt like it was not worth it would i be going back there  no , great place with pool table and outdoor seating next to the road but once youve been taking full advantage of the 5hourlong happy hour you would not notice

great belgian beers on tap or bottle, great place to have a drink andor food after work or during lunch time they have a billard table inside which is great too i like the place nice staff here too price is fine enjoy the happy hour every day

the service is also excellent prices are also good be sure to visit during happy hour  between 5pm and 10pm and get two drinks for one, highly recommended
1a essen zu fairem preis zur happy hour gibt es zwei getranke zum preis von einem
good meals and good price service is best i ever experienced table kicker and pool billard available projector wall with live events own toilet cleaning personal western and asien food, my young son and i stayed at the narada next door  chalet plus quickly became our heaven the pizzas are fabulous  perfect for my son i was homesick for a steak  and coming from an aussie their steak is fantastic just like a great bistro feed from back home we will continue to stay at the narada because of this fantastic venue additionally the pool table fooseball table  dart board kept my busy son satisfied  their not too many playgrounds to wear out a busy young boy, located close to yu yuan the chalet plus bar and grill is a great place to have a drink and catch up with friends even better if you organise to meet during happy hour where you will get your drink and a free one to follow staff are welcoming and provide terrific service the food is tasty too, for dinner there is an ok menu just not fantastic youll definitely find something to eat and the prices are reasonable the drinks are extensive and the atmosphere lively and fun definitely an enjoyable place to end the night, so happy to find chalet plus we were staying at the narada boutique hotel next door and practically walked bycouldnt be happier that we didnt mostly western food
freshly done great atmosphere really good beer and wine selections with awesome happy hour 2 for 1 specials from 510pm
good price point service is friendly and efficient  you wont regret stopping in, we accidently stepped into the bar because we saw the pool table the bar is very nice and there are different good offers every day also there is a happy hour everyday between 5  10 pm where every drink is �buy 1 get one free� the bartender is also a very friendly guy unfortunately he beat us at three games of pool not only for another challenge well definitely come back to chalet plus , friendly service decent prices with some good specials clean good food we went there twice in one day and the owner brought us some free desserts, chalet plus at 833 renmin lu near the intersection with huaihai dong lu offers a long happy hour wide assortment of beers and wines a decent choice of cocktails and is well attended by a mixed crowd of local chinese and foreigners you will be well served by an attentive and knowledgeable staff and the ownermanager denis is almost always in place to answer any questions there is a food special for each day of the week as well as other dishes large or small a very good place to spend an evening of drinks eats if you want either alone or with friends all reasonably priced all in all a nice relaxing place to have a wine beer and eats, a trendy well fitted barrestaurant on renmin rd next door to narada hotel owned by the very friendly denis great food and very friendly staff a good range of weekly specials make this a place well worth stopping at as i have more than once, a nice place in shanghai where you can find good dishes and good drinks with several offers each day they have promotions and all days you can get the happy hour from 2 to 10 pm
try dish and chips and salmon and sparragus with honey mustard as a good combination with your drinks, an obvious option for some decent food if staying in narada hotel  this restaurant is just 10 meters from the hotel entrance
good beer and good mainly western food, ate here a few times after a busy day of sightseeing the bar is right next to the narada boutique hotel and offers both chinese and western food beer and wine readily available with happy hour every evening from 5pm if you want a quick casual meal and time to catch up on emails in a nice mostly smokefree environment then i recommend the chalet, we stayed next door at narada boutique hotel and passed this pub and the one next door a few times one night after a long day of hot sightseeing where we were exhausted and hungry we decided to stop in one of the pubs we actually went to the one next door and it was loud and had a drunk couple arguing so we left and came here ahhh it had some quiet music a great menu and comfortable seating after eating dumplings and other local food for 5 days we decided to split a burger and fries excellent and big burger good fries we returned another time at happy hour and got bruschetta and meat and cheese plate huge portion attentive service and attractive pub was never crowdedbusy if you are in the area and craving this type of food and maybe cocktails or beer chalet is a great option, i ate here several times the food is great the staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable it is right next to the narada boutique hotel, granted we ended up at chalet plus after walking out of a local shanghai restaurant after spotty service and encountering a menu with which we were simply uncomfortable we were starving and desperate
luckily this bar  grill was next to our hotel
we actually could not believe the quality of the food our expectations were not particularly high but they were exceeded the staff was fast and attentive and they had a tremendous commend of english we enjoyed the place so much that we went back the following night
they have large tv projector screens showing sports for example we watched replays of the recent mayweatherpacquiao fight
we had bruschetta pasta and simple spring rolls but they were consistently good, friendly and helpful english speaking chinese staff provide efficient service this well set out bar and grill offers happy hour drinks and daily food specials a pleasant ambiance with a sport screen movies on tv and pleasant background music is a pleasant treat for international visitors to shanghai the food is good and the drinks are cold enjoy","bar",0.656805340551429
177,"i went nanxiang mantou dian at yu yuan area in the past
so i try branch shop at wujiang road
this is located 2nd floor at foods plaza near
the west nanjing road station exit 4
i visited at 1830 but visitors are not many
when i visited yu yuan original restaurant
there were so many visitors
this branch shop is one of idea to enjoy without waiting, located in yuyuan this branch of nanxiang mantou is very nice on its appearance classic and exotic the food also is nice try their xiaolungbao, read reviews that its really good with hundreds of years of history on our first visit we went to level 3 but there was a queue so we left we returned again 2 days later we were then told by a waitress at level 3 that if we spend more than <u+00a5>80 per person we can join another queue that offers more food choices and this queue is indeed shorterhowever if the spending is minimum <u+00a5>150 the menu will be a full menu there was no queue and available table so we went to this room
we order the famous crab toe steam dumpling that comes in 6 in a basket some cold dishes dim sum and a braised eel that is supposed to be a famous shanghainese dish
the xiao long bao was a great disappointment the skin is thick little juice which is essential for xiao long bao and i had tasted much better ones in most chinese restaurants eg crystal jade and tin tai fung the eel was extremely salty and not edible we ask the waitress to redo the dish and they readily did the other dishes were alright
give it a miss, after reading others reviews i decided that the best thing to do would be to eat on the 3rd floor i arrived about 1145 and there was a slight wait maybe 15 minutes when i left the line was twice the length when i was in it

i ordered the traditional dumplings edamame egg drop soup and a beef dish way too much food for one person but i did my best i was under the understanding that there was a minimum $ amount per personif thats true i was either over it or they didnt mention it

the xiao long bao was the best ive ever eaten i went the next day to another place and although the second place was good they werent nearly as good as nanxiangs, one of the most well known places in shanghai for everyones favorite snack soup dumplings but i dont really understand why this place remains so busy huge lines outside this restaurant all the time mostly for the take out section you can skip the lines if you go upstairs to the restaurant instead costs are a bit higher upstairs but the dumplings are made in the same kitchen

the dumplings are purely average jia jia tang bao fu chun even din tai fung taiwanese not really shanghainese are all much better than here

it is fun to get soup dumplings in a fun touristy place like the yu yuan market but if looking for the best taste try one of my other recommendations above instead, theres always a long queue for takeaway opted to dinein and was directed to the xiao long bao section you cant order anything except xlb therefore it was quick careful when sipping the soup using the straw as it is very hot and also try not to poke around too much as the soup will spill onto the bottom, arrive at 8am they only serve small dumplings and chicken soup nothing else 
ginger have to pay separately

taste wise ok only
skin too thick

i am sorry to say restaurant din tai fung the best in shanghai

11am i walk pass many people queue up buying the bigger version dumpling many people also say no good

need to improve on the food standard a lot, on the second floor overlooking the yu garden is a great place for breakfast  the only drawbackit has one item its menu that one item of crab and pork dumplings was phenomenal though as each order contained about 1215 dumplings small

while the lack of options may bother some individuals there is something to be said of doing one thing well this place for breakfast may have taken that to an extreme

a good sign of the food quality were the amount of locals inside eating breakfast as only one table was open would definitely recommend this cozy restaurant filled with locals and would go back if in the area again, maybe it is hyped a bit but i always come back here the dumplings are outstanding particularly the pork and crab roe lines outside sometimes circle the building but if you dont mind paying a bit of a minimum charge head upstairs for a little quieter space that is almost always line free, i should share with you about the restaurant how its setup
gf  when you first see it you will see many people queuing they are very likely to be queuing for the takeaway
1f  casual dining
2f  semi casual
3f  slightly more formal
of course its quite obvious the prices will increase as you go up each floors

i visited nanxiang mantou dian on 1st january 2017 one of my first meals of 2017 actually it is personally i dont enjoy queuing so i decided to arrive there early i got there around 930am i didnt need to queue and sat the 2nd floor i opted for their signature crab roe soup dumplingxiaolongbao the one you eatdrink with straw that tasty and worth the wait in fact the dumpling skin is very thick and the soup quite small i then ordered the panfried dumplings again very disappointed with the standards the skin was thick and wasnt that great i was glad that i didnt queue as i wouldve been super disappointed the queue started to grow at around 10am i am sure i will not come back to visit again

overall i believe its overpriced and of course because the travel guides say its a must eat then of course everyones first visit and never tried will visit it if its me i would advice you to save your money and time miss it out if can or just simply order one before regretting i would suggest you to wake up earlier to avoid the queues

like what some reviews said the standards has dropped and just very disappointing the customer service isnt that great either perhaps there had been some management changes and just cannot keep up with their standards, the soup dumplings are still great id go here for the xiao long bao either pork or the seafood and pork the big crab roe soup dumpling is also good but it has shrunk since my last visit the fried dishes are good but not inspired the restaurant has gotten dirtier since my last visit five years ago and the service level has decreased although that could be attributed to the holiday season couple of tips  if youd like to sit down at a restaurant as opposed to ordering the xiaolongbao to go go up the second floor if theres a line of people waiting you need to get into that line to get a seat in the restaurant they churn through their customers quickly so the line moves there is an english language menu to ask for you order and pay in advance, thank you for my shanghainese friend for bringing me here and i have to say it tastes great especially the soup dumpling love it, this is my 2nd visit after 4yrs disappointed
all food that we ordered serving fast but not hotdont find their signature crab roe soup bao nicenot worth paying cny35mini dumplings tastless and their xiao long bao was so so only
yuyuan street food tastes much nicer than the restaurant, come here for xiao long bao xlb soup dumplings menu is in english theres us a casual and more formal dining room and there can be a wait since this is a famous restaurant

regular xlb is good with a lot of soup inside the crab roe xlb is also great the vegetable xlb was surprisingly good though no soup

the shrimp xlb wasnt that good the glutinous rice order is very small and not that good, great little dumpling restaurant by the garden very simple menu but quick and delicious go upstairs for seating on the 2nd floor, nanxiang is a well established xiaolongbao restaurant they have take out fast food on the ground floor regular restaurant on the second floor exclusive restaurant 80rmb minimum and the ulitmate restaurant 150 rmb minimum as expected the more expensive the area the shorter the line and the better the air conditioning so you can get decent cheap xiaolongbao or expensive one in the expensive area they have hybrid xiaolongbao like foie gras abalone matsutake mushroom but those are all not very good try the basic and the crab one i go there when i take people to visit yuyuan and, we dined on the 3rd floor ordering an assortment of dishes and all of them were just average weve had better back home in our canadian city a bit pricey as to be expected at 260 rmb for the three of us  and it definitely wasnt a filling meal either the only dish that isnt pictured was the stinky tofu which was 4 pieces to an order oh and the pot of tea which was 48 rmb but this place is like an institution that we had to try for ourselves and we didnt feel like braving the lines on the lower floors for cheaper prices so now we know, not knowing much about this place we went to the 3rd floor as there was no room on the first two this was a good choice because we got to sit down and order from the menu which was also in english their signature xiaolongbao is absolutely divine they were better than the dumplings at din tai fung and cheaper there is something special about the soup they use id definitely go again and again, overpriced rmb 50 for a big crab soup dumpling personally think that it�s just another tourist gimmick taste wise is still acceptable, this place was very busy probably because the food was very good we stopped here to have a quick lunch and enjoyed it after a long walk watching this part of town, go to the 3rd floor right away it has nicer setting service is good we did enjoy the dumplings egg soup river eel and some other local specialties truly enjoyed it for a foreigner it did not seem like too touristy place go for dumplings, visited the beautiful yu yuan gardens and had to get something to eat for lunch saw many people queueing up at ground floor  thought this must be good finally it came in boxes of 12s and it was lousy in my opinion vs din tai fungs or jia jia outlet the dough was rough thick and tasted as if it was not steamed well it reminds me of a disguntled employee who is forced to come to work everyday and this dumpling is their work the juice  pork were just ordinary, for the best food and experience do not get the dumplings on the first or second floor go to the third floor and get a table on the left side the service will be very good the food quality and selection will be much much better also for the best dumplings get the signature crab roe dumplings not to be confused with crab meat dumplings, everyone serve the same dumplings but this place has a bridge to the restaurant so it looks nicer they have second and third floor but the difference is not obvious at the beginning anyway we just took from the second floor its like fast food  everyone orders the dumpling and a drink and then scramble to find a seat in the crowded mess ultimately the waitress comes with a trolley i didnt think it was that good because skin too thick for the dumplings  but my children wanted more so i went to buy takes about another 30 minutes so we decided to eat again at another place third floor was much nicer ambience and more than 10 times the price  rmb55pax vs rmb for basket of 8  depends on whether one feels like paying up, i opted for the 12 crab and pork dumpling option which cost me 22rmb which is extremely good value for dumplings that were so well cooked and seasoned there is a queue to be served here and it is blindingly obvious why � these are amazing however 12 dumplings were simply too much for me and i gave about half away to a homeless person i think he knew this was the best place to hang around as the food was exceptional, i really enjoyed my takeaway steam buns i managed to get there when there was not much of a line which is supposedly rare really no choice at the takeaway counter you will get what is available but what got was really fresh and really tasty im no expert on steamed buns who is but i thought they were yummy, we came here at around 9am on sunday there was a long queue downstairs we came to the 2nd floor there was still one  two empty tables

surprisingly most are local chinese

we ordered different dumplings

the price was okay but the quality was not good the service was nothing

din tai fung shall be a better choice, my family and i dined here for diner and got an assortment of dishes they were reasonably priced and the flavors of the dishes were good
there wasnt a big wait on the food or large crowds which was good, supposedly famous but not something that you need to carve out time for the restaurant has three levels level 1 for takeaway only cheapest price but only the standard xiao long bao is available level 2 is a small dining area and same dumplings priced a bit higher level 3 has 3 queue options average spend per pax of 50 80 or 150 queue gets shorter as average spend goes up and more variety on the menu as well of course the same thing will be much more expensive compared to the takeaway counter at ground floor

dumplings taste quite good but not something that is out of the ordinary, xiaolongbaos or tangbaos were quite tasty but a pity quality was inconsistent some had no soup in them or the skin was a tad too thick we ordered other dim sums on the menu because xlbs took at least 20mins but they were all disappointing unless we visit yu garden again we wouldnt make a deliberate trip for this another option would be jia jia tang bao on huanghe road but in our opinion the ambience is a big minus point, right in the middle of the tourist area of old town so i was wary but hungry not sure if it was because i was so hungry but i really enjoyed the food here  its not too expensive considering its location, the food was nice but i could recommend that you dont need to order the expensive dim sum menu you can be satisfied with the normal menu it was very crowded and waiting so long if you pay more your waiting time would be shortened, this place was so crowded that you walked away the first time we were there then we went back there the next day around 1100 am before the lunch crowd appeared there was a usual long line outside however there was no crowd going inside we went to the third floor with decent seating the food there was good we realized that the menu and variety of food was different depending on where you sit make sure you ask the servers and look at the menu, first time i tried soup dumplings and they were delicious im a pescatarian and usually soup dumplings only have meat so i was happy to find a vegetarian version i would go upstairs to the restaurant and be served rather than wait in the long line it was a lot faster, wanted to try this place as i heard its a branch of the original restaurant to first serve xiaolongbao dumplings the queue starts from the ground floor all the way up to 3rd floor i walked up to the head of the queue to see whats up there and the restaurants usher who is the same guy in the poster tells me to join another queue on the 3rd floor it seems the 2 queues are going to different sections of the restaurant the dumplings were ok but the fried vegetables had a weird smell similar food could be had elsewhere might not be worth the wait, very conspicuously positioned in this touristy area many food shows will mention this place but honestly all hype the best dish in this restaurant is suppose to be the xiao long bao soup dumpling but it is at best below average when compared to other places like din tai fung etc youre better off getting a quick togo from a xiao yang sheng jian yangs frieddumpling outlet anywhere in shanghai, how it works the upper the level the more expensive
1f for takeaway cheap but long queue and almost no service
2f xiao long bao around <u+00a5>2530 selfservice help yourself to find a table order at counter and get the food
3f xiao long bao around <u+00a5>4555 less crowded being served but minimum charge <u+00a5>50 per head applies

i was starving and went up 3f directly to skip the crowd the place is still so noisy and nosoclean

i ordered the crab roe xiao long bao <u+00a5>55 the soup bao <u+00a5>35 and chinese tea<u+00a5>5

the crab roe xiao long bao and the soup bao were too dry the skin was too thick and obviously overcooked

this quality of food and service does not worth at all i rather go ding tai feng, tourist place crowded over priced
it would be ok considering the popular location
but the food is actually horrible  greasy yes greasy steam dumplings  tasteless when not foul tasting thick overcooked pasta around a chunk of fatty and flavourless filling the broth inside the dumplings tastes and looks like dishwashing water a crying shame of a dumpling
do also not trust lonely planet guidebook on that they must either never have actually tasted the food there at least recently or they have no idea what they are talking about or worse they got compromised making their review otherwise i ca not understand how they would not charitably recommend to give the place a miss
the best thing you can do there is to look at people queuing and then smile in relief any walk no run away, heard about this place with long queue but was a disappointment the crab meat xiao long bao were too dry hardly any soup inside although the skin were not torn it cost yuan556 pieces while the pork xiao long bao cost yuan356 piecesthe crab meat soup in the dumpling skin yuan 35pc has strong ginger taste and left me with dry lips thereafter the smelly doufu is not bad though limited selection in the menu you pay at the same time as you order, recommended in lonely planet but we find it by luck we had gone to the old town we want to visit the garden it was late and we had not eaten suddenly we realize that this restaurant was there steamed dumplings seemed good to us
the queue outside to take away was huge we went up and in the restaurant were lots of empty tables huge a bit messy we had a paper put some crosses in the names of things we wanted to eat and paid then the food started coming good dumplings cheap, you cant miss this <u+5c0f><u+7b3c><u+5305> when you are in shanghai this is the original chinese dumpling shop which are spread to many corner of the rest of the world using the same recipe name but not their franchises this is one of the local cuisine you must tick in your list the dumpling is juicy and perfectly comes with ginger in black vinegar, my last trip to shanghai 2013 we practically ate here everyday since i loved xiao loong pau and theirs were the best

this time i travelled with my nieces and i took them there to have a taste of shanghai xiao loong pau

as in last time there were two sections upstairs level2 on one side customers will have to spend minimal of 80 per person and on the other side 50 per person

we chose the 80 rmb per pax side decor was still same waiters and waitress wear smart uniforms we ordered a few baskets of pork xiao loong pau and a prawn one we also ordered the kuantangjiao the bigger dumplings with a straw for sampling so the juice inside

xiao loong pau is still good especially the pork ones it has to be eaten hot and care must be taken not to break the covering otherwise the juice will come out the juice is supposed to be the best part

nanking xiao loong pau is also available in nanny road and in food court down in zhenhuang temple but those taste not as good as the original in the restaurants those are cheaper too i suspect there are different grades of cooks and these cooks determine the prices and taste of the xiao loong pau

eat at the restaurant if you want the best and always order the pork ones  they are the best, when to nanxiang mantou dain years back and longing to have a good bite of the famous xiaolong bao but is kind of disappointment after the recent visit we feel that at least a 50 drop in standard 
not recommended if you are a xiaolong bao lover
gavin goh
singapore, the classic place for 30+ years ive been downstairs with the tons of tourists and recommend going to the 3rd floor its a pricer but you dont have to fight for a table and dining space order several different types of xiao long bao and enjoy, in my memory nanxiang bun shop is the famous shop in shanghai when i went to shanghai i also will go to try it because their xiaolongbao is very delicious compare with other xiaolongbao is a popular steam bun no matter you is children or adult it also contain with meat some special xiaolongbao will contain with special material for example it will contain with vegetable seafood etc no matter what you contain it also have some juice soup inside when the xiaolongbao is just completed it is so hot thus many people hurt the mouth because they did not carefully the hot however this also a reason for delicious because when it is hot the soup and the bun is the most fresh many people are like this feeling but from this recent year the shop cannot make the better bun for people because i try it many time there have different level of taste and there become many people to wait because they are first time and want to try the famous xiaolongbao but now i think it is become disappointed for me i will recommend you to try once but i will not to try again unless it can make me love it again, i went there at around 3pm and even then there was a line it did move quite quickly though the line to actually buy the xiaolongbao without sitting is longer than it is to get in the restaurant the restaurant itself is quite spacious however the waiters do not speak english very well so as a tourist it was quite difficult to understand that menu tip ask for the menu with pictures also the dumpling with the straw doesnt have meat in it its not a xiaolongbao, came here on a thursday night and went upstairs to sit this is not my first time coming but it sure has changed since my first experience when we first came the tables were kept clean the service was attentive and excellent and the food was decent

this time when we came the tables were filthy dried sauce spills crusted on the plates and utensils were questionable the service was dismissive at best and the food had an offflavor you still have to pounce on a table to sit scarcity still reigns but the staff is lazy they dont bother busing the tables  the teapot from the previous party was never cleared away it was worse than some of the lesser offthemaindrag mcdonalds i have encountered on road trips through the us

you might let all the atmospheric issues go as long as the food tasted good but even that has gone downhill the skin on the dumplings is thicker than it should be and kind of tough the meatball inside has very little soup and if it was supposed to be pork then someone needs to check with the supplier seasonings were completely wrong starting with a complete lack of ginger dont bother

clearly this place has run downhill over time they likely survive because of their former reputation combined with their location in the heart of a tourist tchotchke mecca however its never pretty when a place is just skating along on their reputation particularly an eating venue dont bother coming here for the experience  there are much better xiaolongbao places all over shanghai, 15 years ago when we were here we queued a long time round the block for the dumplings it was really delicious then with juices bursting out from the dumplings when u bite into them

this trip we saw that the queue was short but because the weather was so cold we decided to go up to the3rd floor n had a sit down meal the price for takeaway differs from the sit down meal some of the dumplings were already  flat meaning no more juices when u bite into them the top of the dumplings where the multi layered folds were was also hard they are good and tasty but not the best in shanghai, go upstairs to get a table ordered pork dumplings and porkcrab dumplings both were good but we liked porkcrab better it did take forever for them to come out and that is the reason for 4 stars, found this place by chance and almost didnt go in as it looks very local but if you do go in and of you can navigate the menu well what a treat i was with someone who spoke very good mandarin she is chinese so she ordered a selection of impressive steamed buns xiaolongbao dumplings and tasty treats i think this possibly tops as one of the most authentic and enjoyable meals i have eaten in china the view across the water at the old tea house helps but it is the atmosphere and authenticity that really makes this place something special","Indian cuisine",0.999822463832907
178,"as i went there they had for almost a hole week the same group playing swing the entry shows a wooden old stair with pictures of famous jazz artists once inside there are little tables next to the stage on same level a big bar and some high tables also to share the atmosphere was good some young chinese and more non asiatic foreigners  the swing group i heard was composed by french people, we popped in without reservations more than one hour before the music was scheduled to start we got a seat at the bar but the place quickly filled up drinks were seriously expensive but for the sake of live music we didnt mind the musicians were great and the atmosphere was super fun well definitely be back, this is a good place to go that is really close to the bund area

musicians are normally really good

can get busy so be prepared to stand for most of the night also a good night is to do dinner in the restaurant area and listen to blues and jazz music in the background, house of blues and jazz  just off the bund has been around a long time i have lived in shanghai ten years and have visited many many times  really great venue for live music  bands change around every 3 months or so bands come from all over the world and i dont think ive ever been disappointed the place can get brilliantly lively on a friday and saturday night and sunday they have a jamming session there is a charge to get in at the weekend  ive not eaten here  but have had a drink or two  drinks are expensive , if youre into jazz and looking for a great night out then the house of jazz and blues is where you should go

on the downside the place too popular for its size it get quite crowded after 10 pm and you should probably arrive ~1 hour before the live music starts to get a good seat prices are are also a bit expensive even for shanghai, house band was very good straight ahead jazz and blues nice atmosphere with pictures of many jazz legends on the walls menu was bar food which was decent food and drinks were reasonable priced, weve spent several nice evenings in this place the music was great and the band very friendly
barman made great cocktails those a little expensive but shanghai aint no cheap places , house of blues and jazz had a cool atmosphere and the music itself was good 50 rmb cover to get in until midnight drinks very expensive didnt try any food good place to relax and enjoy live music, i could not have scripted a better musical prologue to my christmas and new years eves i visited house of blues and jazz on both nights after attending concerts at the shanghai oriental arts centera 9 piece baroque orchestra ensemble and the shanghai national symphony orchestra respectively everything was just right the general atmosphere the food the drinks the warmhearted welcome of staff and of course the music of the jefferey simons trio jeff brian and mike w a featured 4th on both nights it had been oh so long since i had had the pleasure of listening to live blues and jazz of such superb quality and variety not in fact since my days in canada my sincere thanks to the jefferey simons trio for providing a perfect ending to two wonderful musicfilled days a couple final notes on the music firstthe sound level and acoustics were bangon i have been to some blues and jazz bars where the musicians left me with the impression they would have preferred playing heavy metal i do love hard rock and some heavy metal second it is great that they play 3 sets from 10115 or so

i have read some rather negative reviews concerning the quality of food such was definitely not the case for me in fact the caesars salad was one of the best i had tasted since my summer trip to xian when i had occasion to try an italian restaurant called the pumpkin flower the lasagna bolognese and angel hair pasta with shrimp were most satisfying too moreover the prices were at par with many foreign restaurants i have tried throughout chinaand i make it a point to eat a lot of nonchinese cuisine hobj also has a well stocked bar particularly for those of us who enjoy fine singlemalts robin the executive manager even went that extra step by preparing a vesper martini not on the menu according to my preferred portioning and i can indeed have peculiar tastes when it comes to my drinks

allinall the house of blues and jazz is my favourite bar for live music of the kind yes i have been to and also enjoy other shanghai offerings of the same ilk but alas if one must pick then one must given that i live in nanjing only 90120 minutes by highspeed train i will definitely visit again as often as time allows to songlan xing et al a hearty thanks see you soon

ps my understanding is that the jefferey simons trio is featured at house of blues and jazz through to march then a swing band from france is booked for 3 months followed by a return of the jefferey simons trio, very expensive for what you get poor quality food a pint is about <u+00a3>8
scruffy inside more staff than customers whilst we where their
i wouldnt recommend this place, we found a friendly scene at house of blues  jazz during a recent business trip so much so that we went back several times the owner and his wife were hospitable and friendly and there was good nonchinese food there we went for an open mic night and a night that featured local jazz musicians both were fun no cover charge, ok venue about what youd expect for a club located very centrally in a huge city  expensive drinks crowded the music was very good the entertainment was a bar brawl between 2 groups though not smoky at all most full of touristsexpats, not that welcoming went around 8ish place empty should have realised from that and vacated then more staff tan patrons
told band not on till 10 pm fair enough food and drink rediculously over priced could get a meal for 4 next door for the same
couple of not that great ribs and 5 chips a piece of chicken leg and 2 saute potatoes 2 beers rip off
left before jazz band as so not impressed should have gone to peace hotel as just the ambiance there would have been worth it, great live music friendly crowd interesting artwork hospitable entertaining owner
i had a great time, it is an excellent place to relax the mind after 3 days of conference

one of my dining rules in mainland china is avoid any western style food but the pasta there was an exception

had no idea on what to drink the waitress suggested something matched with the food and my mood impressive price of the drink was also reasonable no minimal charge meaning you can order only one drink and stay for the whole night

the band started at 930 the bassist is marvellous so as the band there was a session that guests can perform on the stage with the band two young guys playing piano and saxophone were great there was a couple after them also guests not playing jazz nor blues not bad but i am just not that type performance ended at around 1am seems that the guest session is held every sunday

the pub is located at the bund do enjoy the breeze and the old shanghai view after some alcohol and jazz

there are few steps at the entrance so wheelchair user who cannot walk may have difficulties going there, for our last night in shanhghai we visited this club it was excellent great music and atmosphere though inevitably some people never look up from their phones and even dancing, this place is one of the longest running live music venues in shanghai theyve generally always maintained a high standard of quality with the music drinks arent great and are on the pricey side but these prices are reflective of the location bar staff some not all are realllly rude and impatient, not too crowded no cover charge reasonable prices for drinks and food overall a wonderful time great music
theyre even play requests, while we were there they had a visiting american jazz singer she was fantastic the atmosphere is really cool with your typical dark jazz bar decore

we didnt eat there other than bar snacks but you can eat there the drinks are reasonably priced and the staff and other patrons very friendly

we ended up going a few times while we were in pudong a great way to finish the night off, started with a dinner for 2 food was really good my wife had fish and i beef on bone with mashed potatoes both causes was really good meet was tender and done perfectly price is in the higher end for china after dinner we went to the bar and listen to some really good jazz and shad a few beers
all in all and super evening and a fantastic place it felt like being in chicago in the fifties
staff was service minded and friendly all the way
ill be back, i was here on a saturday evening when the live band was performing entry fee of 50rmb the band was really nice music great and the place is a no smoking zone drink prices are a bit higher but i guess that is expected on that location, this place has great music and atmosphere without a doubt but the cigarette smoke level is catastrophic for non smokers its pretty impossible to stay in this place but if your a smoker then your in heaven , visited the house of blues and jazz in may 2016 the pub had a great atmosphere the band was very good and i would say that all in all a good time was had by group the food at the venue was not particularly good other than that though i would certainly recommend a visit to this pub up if you are in the area and you are a blues and jazz fan, this place is quite nice with good food and good atmosphere the food is also good the only negative is the service they are quite rude and act like you should be thankful to have there attention, night from hell i had a reservation  i show up with business guest they did not have a table for us smokey strange crowd we left and could not get in anywhere else on a busy saturday night end up having to eat at pizza hut avoid these idiots if you can, always a great time the performers do a great job engaging the audience and are very friendly when done with their sets this place is a welcome respite from the typical barsclubs in the bund area drink prices are a little steep but given the location its unavoidable cocktails are pretty well made at least and theres a solid selection draft beer selection is lacking
i definitely prefer house of blues  jazz over cotton club, american food nice vocie of a blues singer atmosphere from the 30s good beer
everything that makes you feel not in shanghai although a few steps from the bund and its view on pudong
expensive, went out with some friends for a nice dinner and live jazz music had a ball  food was good  recommend the steak best part is the music and a great bar hadnt been there in a while and will not make that mistake again it was just a fun evening  pure and simple if you love live jazz and blues this is the place, dinner before the live music
the dining room which is separated from the bar where the stage is located is classically decorated with a bit of vintage allure
we had only one dish plus sides which proved to be a good idea as the portions are opulent
i had a slow cooked beef rib which was generous and tender served with mash potatoes the butter taste was coming out of the mash which gave a rich and pleasant texture
the waitress was helpful and diligent
the wine a chateau de jean gue lalande de pomerol 2011 was pleasant smooth and elegant
the music next door was bias towards blues which is a genre that i really like and the drum directness matched perfectly the guitarist maestria
the draft beers were excellent
overall a great live music place with some earthy food next door, havent tried their food but house of blues  jazz is my favorite night spot in shanghai to go for a drink or two and enjoy great live music with a diverse energetic crowd, if you are a fan of great live music you should definitely visit the house of blues and jazz its one of my top spots whenever im in town

the bands that play there are always top notch there are always professional musicians from the states europe and china completely blowing the house down

the atmosphere is also cool and smooth like the music and they have a great selection of fine if quite expensive cocktails i know they also serve diner but i have never tried it so i cant comment on that

every day is a good day at the house but i would recommend going on sundays for jam night where traveling musicians just improvise with the ones working at the bar

other days it may feel a bit stuffy and high class but on jam night everyone is up for crazy fun the way it should be

last time i was there i was with a friend from new orleans and he said that it felt just like home, if you like music and you visit shanghai for the first time this is a must if you go here when its jam session you might be in for a surprise once when i was her the singer asked for a drummer and the very tiniest chinese woman showed up and what a drummer she was amazing
a wonderful place for music and drinks, i have visited this place a couple of times on fridays earlier during my previous trips to shanghai and really enjoyed the music and ambience however i was disappointed their attitude yesterday i visited the place on a thursday evening the place was relatively empty and they offered me and my friend a table next to the stage however after 15 minutes after they had already taken my order the waiters came and asked us to move from the table their argument was that particular was already reserved apparently for some westerners this clearly reveals their attitude of discriminating against certain customers even after i said i would walk out of the place if i were asked to move the table they didnt seem apologetic

in summary a place to avoid in future , nice cozy western music place in the heart of shanghai with real good and sometimes entertaining musicians

have never eaten here but comes for an hour of music and a beer of which they have murphys  but at 98 rmb it is absolutely paid for

it is not always easy to get the receipt from the waiter

contradicting to other reports here i have never paid entrance fee three times in three years arriving after dinner time in that case i will find the drink price much too high

the biggest drawback is that smoking is permitted all over the place which bothers me a lot, we went on a thursday night and had such a great time returned on friday night food is good quality with lots of choices a variety of worldwide drinks are available and they were well mixed best part though was entertainment and people watching carlton j smith is absolutely an awesome entertainer and the soul brothers were fantastic there was a really interesting cross section of people from around the world and different ages which made for a lot of fun, although the drinks were a bit pricy the beer was cold and the mojitos were spot on live entertainment was off the hook get there early if you want a table otherwise you will have to elbow in at the bar or find room to move on the dance floor a 50rmb cover charge was well worth the price of admission and a great mix of folks from around the world made for interesting conversations i enjoyed my first visit enough to go back for seconds avoid black market taxis for the ride home conveniently located near the bund historical area safe walking about, we were there on our last night in shanghai and we were a mixed group from different corners of the world and different age groups as well the bar was nice yes it is a little pricey but dont we pay a little more in the best bars in the city we are from
the highlight was definitely the band we went there thinking we would be there for an hour but in came the band they had a nice girl at the drums and she was good and in came the highlight of the night mr clark who roped in the crowd and got us to stay till the very end of the night
he got the crowd involved in his music and called us on stage it was hilarious at some points in the end we danced got a pic with the wonderful band there was a family with 3 kids he got them onto the stage to dance as well
love the place love the band love the vibe about the place
awesome fun for us and a good shout to the band mr clark and ms kelly the drummer 
give the bar a shot i would suggest to check if its the same band then def give it a try and be a judge about it
we were a crowd of 19 and we alll loved it equally
at the table you would have to order a drink atleast, this place is not only hyper expensive almost 90 rmb for a beer but the service is abysmal the bartender tried to force us to order more and refused to serve us what we order we ended up by leaving the place pissed and spent the evening somewhere else

basically i asked for one beer for two persons to check if the beer was good or fake before ordering more the bartender started trying to force us to order more and refused to serve us the beer i order he started saying we must order one beer per person and started ignoring me as i told him he doesnt have the right to force us to order something we do not want then he turns to my friend and tried to force him to order one more beer by saying that the band his expensive so that we need to order beer to pay for the band there is an entrance fee and no where it is mentioned that a certain level of consumption is required as my friend has earring problems he had difficulty to understand what was going on so the bartender started talking to him as if my friend was an idiot when i asked to talk to the manager he told us he was in charge which turns out not to be true and told us to leave which we were very happy to do, this bar they have a restaurant i believe as well is a great expat and manonbusinesstrips hangout live jazzy music and good wine
great place to after a dinner around the bund but dont expect to meet a lot of local people, what a great way to spend the night we had dinner and listened to some great blues wish we had found this venue 3 years ago when we started visiting shanghai will definitely be going back and bring our friends along, i had dinner and of course spent the rest of my evening there because when the band starts to play you dont get out trust me very good music component singer and add magical atmosphere if you dont mind bedding immersed in care smoke and i dont smoke but it all add to the ambience off the place decadent and blues
the restaurant is nothing to speak of but if you come early at least you have the option, heavy bloodmaroon curtains drape the walls and from ceiling to eye level smoke weighs suspended like a threatening thunder cloud it feels like another time the band take up one corner but their rhythms groove through every cheer wolfwhistle broad smile tapping foot and clapping hand of the packed small room some dance most don�t some close their eyes and nod their head in time some are alone others are in couples or groups but it�s the music that makes the magic that�s what everyone is here for a good live band playing feelgood tunes the lineup varies with musos from the usa and cuba when i visited you can perch at the bar or there�s table service and bonus a restaurant menu which is good recommend the black pepper tuna � if you don�t mind eating in a haze of smoke just a few steps off the bund on fuzhou lu the house of blues  jazz is the juxtaposition of old and new � just like shanghai herself, i had already had dinner before so i just went for a dessert menu was interesting and ample good drink selection and very good live music, there is an abundance of bars lounges and clubs in shanghai especially along zhongshan road we were in a party mood and wanted something different thought to ourselves hey why not check out this place which looked like a hidden gem tucked way in a corner since it had decent reviews we were quickly disappointed

the only salvation and reason why this place still stands is thanks to its band which elevated the atmosphere of the entire establishment

service was sub par and the host was i dare say the most unprofessional service staff ive ever come across from all my years of travels besides a gin  tonic which is hard to mess up every other cocktail ordered from my table of 8 were either bland as if the bar tender has forgotten house to use sugar and lime or simply diluted

while inexpensive compared to where we usually go to on a friday night out i would have rather spent three four even five times more for a drink anywhere else which we did nearby and wished we never stepped into this place which gave our friday evening a very rocky start, food is ok but the place its outstanding for its atmosphere and music its a nice break from the chinese places around , ive been coming here 2 times a year for about 6 years the food is getting better so is the wine list the atmosphere depends upon who you are with and what band is playing this is a great place to hang out listen to music joke around drink and smoke the dining room is quite comfy service is patchy this is not a cheap night out but if you dont enjoy yourself here then there must be somethkng going wrong with you that evening
kick back and groove if you dont like the music leave and come back when you do greg lutrell is a must see when hes in town, imagine to be back in old times a jazz band playing you grab a nice beer maybe a guinness listen to the music talk with your friends maybe even have a dinner there outside the busy shanghai of the 21st century but here almost like in the 1930ies
drinks are really good the music mostly really nice and service is great, nightlife in shanghai is plentiful but if you like live bands i suggest this place it was recommended by the performer at cigar jazz wine bar in xintandi which i also recommend for entertainment both artists were from the states and true musicians the drinks are higher priced since theres no cover charge the ahi tuna appetizer was outstanding, only went in late to listen to the music and have a few drinks we really enjoyed the atmosphere musicians sitting around then getting up to jam with the band one in particular a saxophonist was absolutely brilliant
also sitting at the bar was a guy who was the double of james brown  turned out later he sounded like hime too
friendly staff and a really great vibe would most certainly go again, i love going to this place when visiting shanghai the food is great caters to my western taste buds and is a fun spot to relax good music and a nice gathering of travelers many for businessfrom around the world menu is a bit high end and pricey","Healthy",0.996580519099305
179,"i must confess i was a bit pissed of for the long time wait as the place was literally packed but at the end it all worth the service the freshness of the ingredients the variety of the sauces and the meat cuts  all were perfect with reasonable prices, its super fun for our kids  3yo and 5yo  and the food is good with excellent service its certainly an experience i highly recommend
 the service is outstanding for at this type of casual restaurant you have a dedicated waiterwaitress they gave you wipes for your glasses hairband for your hair toys for kids reservation is highly recommended but if you are waiting they offer you drinks games and snacks
 the food is good i havent been to other hotpot in shanghai in recent years so i am sure there are other places offer better food but i will still choose this place over others when i do my annualbiannual trip to shanghai with my kids
 performance
 change face the guy is dressed in traditional chinese opera costume and performs change face near your table not sure how often and when to expect but its a huge hit for our kids
 noodle making if you order noodle you will get someone making the noodle dancing hiphop in front of you and fly the noodle to the hotpot we ordered 2 portions so the kids got to practice as well again they had great fun

other fun factors for kids
 as most of the hotpot place you get to pickup the source of dipping there are dozens of choices and my kids enjoyed choosing and making their own
 there is also a playroom with someone supervising again a great feature keeping your kids entertained while enjoying the dinner, i came with some friends to try this restaurant and found it very good with a wide range of sauces and the waiters are great
a happy return, there is no doubt haidilao sets the bar high for food and service their commitment to satisfying their customers needs to be experienced to believe this being said after having meals at other similar priceranged restaurants where else can you go to be entertained by a hiphop dancer making noodles in front of you facechanging performance dedicated server for your table and so on they supply wipes for your phones too at the end of the meal my kid left with 3 toys and a big bag of snacks not that they were expensive stuff but its sufficient to make a kid happy  like a happy meal minus the burger shows and gifts aside the beef pork seafood and other food we ordered were up to mark

we paid about rmb600 for that dinner and it was worth every yuan, i read the reviews of this place and told myself i gotta try before leaving shanghai indeed there was no regret except the fact that there is only so much food that i could take
there were only 2 of us but we ordered like for 5 the waitress was very kind and helped us to reduce the amount till a comfortable number
we had two types of soup the nonspicy one and a chillifilled oily mala soup nice when its hot but after a while the spicy taste gets to you
luke i said you gotta try to know it, a place that you could entertain yourself but not my style of dining with all due respect i did not like the quality of the ingredients neverthless service was good and prices were cheap, fun place to go with friendsfood is very good and waiting staff are very good
especially liked the kung fu noodle show when you order the noodles
they have a few branches in shanghai, hai di lao huo guo is a leading hotpot chain in china and you will not be disappointed we had lunch with a company of 7 6 adults one child of 3 there is a separate childrens corner were staff will pamper your child while you are enjoying your meal
we had a personal waiter taking care of everything with humor too excellent food and service you certainly wont look for another hotpot restaurant, first of all i am not a hot pot fan but my wife is and so we tried various hot put places in shanghai on our holidays this one was by far the best the most authentic this also means that it was loud and bright and you could not get too far with english this said the menu came as an ipad with pictures so no problem ordering the 5 stars are for the food if you like spicy hot pots this is where you want to go the spicy half was so burning hot that my lips were buzzing after ten minutes and i had to switch to the less spicy half my wife however enjoyed it very much also this place is huge so no reservation needed most of the time and it is open until past midnight most places in shanghai close at 10 with last orders received at 9 so this is perfect for a late night dinner, this is our hotspot spot in whole shanghai consistently perfect service fresh ingredients a yummy hotspot experienceour only address for hotpot, its my place to go to when i feel like having hotpot great service the minute you walk through the door the quality of the food is good though they have reduced the choice by quite a bit over the years the sauce bar is really extensive and the waiters look really happy to be working there and try to make you feel like royalty when you dine there they have this beef that is very tender and make sure you order their handpulled noodles so that you could enjoy the spectacle of the guy pulling it in front of you you can also queue up for a free manicure if you have the time, never doubt about the restautrant now the staff really engaged with the guestlove them we wnet to the newly open one at the buxingjiethe staff even dance with usso much fun for the evening, this place provide 24 hrs service the waiters  waitress very polite  helpful by take time to explain their menu if u r first time to the shop
value for money  the good are good healthy food  cleanness environment
must try it if u in beijing or shanghai, this is the restaurant that prior the customers by giving their best to meet every customers demand i do not like to make a reservation when im not in a rush though because i enjoyed their waiting service if youre coming here for the first time please enjoy their service fully your phone is running out of battery its okay they will help you you want to have some hot towels its okay theyll serve you happily just try to speak out any request it would be fun but not too outrageous =d
their food is okay but the service has overwhelmed the food it worth a try by the way i love their popcorn very much im not a popcorn fans but i really love it and yeah its 24 hours and they have delivery service but you need to make a reservation for that at least 3 days if im not mistaken sit back and enjoy, went here with some colleagues from work food was very good although very hot temperature but that seems to be the way the like their food in shanghai we had a mix of vegetables tofu meets and seafood  all were good lots of sauces to try
as for entertainment various entertainers walked around the restaurant one guy used a tofu noodle and streamed it through the air as he did acrobatics another person changed a masked face in the blink of an eye many many times  there is a name for this but i cannot remember it, hence the waiting time but the good news is the place is open 24 hours the service is faultless and the prices are very reasonable at around 100 rmb per person it has quite a few branches in other parts of shanghai including pudong, good restaurant for chinese hot pot excellent service the even clean your shoes glasses telephone during the waiting time in fact this is the only problem its so famous and good that you need to wait for about 1 hour","steakhouse",0.999840243347199
18,"great location in the old town with a great view over the bund food is very nicely presented good wine list nice service very nice little cocktail bar next door for an aperitif so good we want twice on our 5 night visit, a musr go in shanghaifood delicious beautiful decor and very pleasant athmospherethe menu have excelenr options to share fancy place, i came here for afternoon tea today and enjoyed the experience very much the location is spectacular and i would recommend asking to sit outside to really enjoy the view when i booked online it said they only had seats inside but there was clearly space outside i should have asked to move the service was a little gruff to start but did warm up i was there on my own and you tend to notice these things more than when you are with others i had the full high tea for 138y although i did get charged for a second pot of tea when i asked for the pot to be filled with hot water which i though was a little much the sweet treats were beautiful 2 small pieces of cake and two small scones jam and cream but the bread on the sandwiches had dried out a little all the little attentions to detail plates cups napkins cutlery toilets were beautiful overall a very nice way to spend sunday afternoon, m on the bund was one of the better restaurants i ate at while in shanghai great wine selection and staff was very attentive can get pricey but totally worth it, i was suggested by a friend i would say it is fusion chinese really tasty and not at all expensive even with wine house wine really good shock about desserts huge and really good view from the terrace is unique over shanghai, our conference hosts arranged a dinner at this iconic restaurant the cousine is western with a modern australian influence nights are probably best with a view of the skyline note that many building switch off their illumination at 1000 pm so make suire that you get great pics before hand, first night in shanghai we went to m for dinner and we were blown away by the food see service and the views, m on the bund are one of many elegant restaurants on the bund where you pay more for the location than the food having said that the food is good and tasty albeit very small portions, we had a business lunch here and the room was nice and warm the staff were very friendly and attentive on the whole the meal was great and tasty unfortunately we could hardly see across the bund to pudong would recommend for a western style meal, pre cny dinner taken here as a thankyou from my boss very impressive lived up to its reputation on the bund  views straight over to shanghais pearl tower the service prompt professional attentive but with a casual twist no starch and pretentiousness found in similar styled restaraunts the food very creative innovative and taste to back it up tables well spaced which was a pleasant surprise considering the location and extortionate rents that are often demanded for such prime real estate definitely on the cards for a return visit soon, the bund is all about the view  either from the bund across to piudong or the other direction the key aesthetic is the contrast of old and new classic and modern with the older stately commercial buildings of the bund repurposed into restaurants and clubs and the breathtakingly 21st century view of pudongs skyscrapers filling the skyline m on the bund sits comfortably on the line in between with a britishcolonial vibe inside and a fabulous view from the terrace bar the food isnt stunning for the price but the westernstyle brunch is a good excuse to linger and the high tea is classic cakestands and cucumber sandwiches, this restaurant takes you back to the 1930s before the revolution when elegantly dressed women strolled the bund its got beautiful classic decor great views of pudong across the huangpu river and excellent chinese cuisine take your significant other here for a special evening, nice and attractive menu and good and extensive wine list attentive service my first rasty neil at glam bar, we headed in for lunch and the place was quiet and so the staff were attentive and accomadating

the view from the veranda was beautiful definitely be seated there if the weather permits

the food was very good especially the tortellini and stuffed chicken however we felt the price was a little expensive, this restaurant was amazing the food is very good but the reason it surpassed my expectation was the balcony the restaurant has an incredible view of the city that you can step out onto that is unencumbered by the neighbouring skyscrapers come at night and bring your camera, the view from this restaurant is superb you can go out to the outdoor eating area to take beautiful pictures of the bund and the pudong skyline the service was excellent the entree i had was fine it wasn�t so delicious that i returned during this trip but i may return to eat here if i am in shanghai again, the day after valentines day shanghai returns to normal a lovely romantic location beautiful views excellent service and a menu that suits pretty much anyone it is difficult traversing the western  asian gap in menus but m does it really well the precinct is well served with great venues but this one has a real tangible feeling of class and old world it is not cheap but it is good perfect for a quiet romantic date, other than the view i just dont understand the fussfood is fussy formal and forgettable the only strong memory i have of m on the bund was the bill, had a nice dinner however i had expect it to be more special  unfortunately the signature dish lamb was not available the steak tartar was good  as well as the suckling pig  the view on the bund is one of the main strong points  will be back in the summer to eat outside, we went for a drink on new years day at m the setting and views are incredible very much old world stuff the service was a bit on the slow side

most of the patrons had a high tea and that looked fabulous

what a wonderful afternoon even although it is not inexpensive, m on the bund offers the best food you can find on the bund they offer a combination of chinese and french dishes on a very high level, the m on the bund is a stunning restaurant it is perched up high on top of the building overlooking the water and the bund the decor is beautiful  the staff very attentive tho a little humourless
we loved our cocktails dinner was a little disappointing my husband had a beef bourguignon which unfortunately was a deconstructed one i had pumpkin filled ravioli with burnt butter  sage not the best ive had dessert redeemed itself with a fabulous pavlova, i have been going to this restaurant since 2005 it started out the entire high end restaurant scene in shanghai and it was fantastic it is now living off past laurels and charging high prices i am no longer interested in their pricevalue, a brilliant restaurant serving dishes both in the traditional style but also with a bit of a twist everything is done well and i couldnt recommend it more the prices are very reasonable and to top it off the view over the bund is great, the food is delicious
the prices are incredibly reasonable
the location is perfect
value x 3, this restaurant is the product of a frenchman who set it up with exquisite taste and serves magnificent dishes just as the tables were set with beautiful white linen and napkins the extremely polite waiters were allowed to wear jeans and sneakers it faces shanghai<u+00b4>s icon  the big ball with a tall tower that a tourist should visit and at nights the icon<u+00b4>s colors change constantly the food was superb and beautifully presented i deeply regret it<u+00b4>s so far away so as to impede visiting it often we indulged in salmon and escargots as entrees and moved on to exquisite veal chops don<u+00b4>t miss out of this fine restaurant where only in paris have we had such service, god we love this place as regular travelers to china since 1990 weve watched michelle garnauts two restaurants capital m in beijing and m on the bund grow to stratospheric heights since they first opened our recent trip to shanghai meant two meals at m on the bund and neither disappointed i mean how can you be dispirited when faced with the best souffles on the planet ballotine of chicken over wild yunnan mushrooms rabbit stew flavoured in vermouth almonds and dill and washed down with a few glasses of 2012 chateau de saint pey but its the staff who excel at this the first restaurant to open on the bund back in 99 the unflappable bruno van der burg who oversees proceedings with humour but doesnt miss a trick the hilarious eda who remembers what you drank 4 nights ago oh and david in the glam bar for pre dinner drinks try the wonderful apple martini ms is a very apt eatery for shanghai glitzy fashionable and fun then theres the food were heading back now, stopped in for dinner with a coworker the decor and music was lovely  very 1920s style as others have pointed out we were seated by the patioterrace area that faced the bund so we had a lovely view while dining both of us opted for the set menu which is quite a steal at ~600rmb pp and we were not disappointed i didnt care much for the seafood bisque but the foie gras seated scallop steak fillet and pavlova were all delicious and exquisite in presentation the food was french with a twist of fusion i also loved how it was just the right amount of food  i didnt leave feeling hungry or too full i would definitely recommend this spot to business travelers or for a fun date spot, staying for 5 years in shanghai working for 3 years in fb my heart is comletely belong to this place best service delicious food nice atmosphere and awesome view on pudong even though its a fine dining and you will spend at least 8001000rmb per person for dinner but it definitely worth it, terrible food  overpriced  and staff who dont look so happy to be there
had the foie gras en torchon  too hard  almost frozen to cut with a knife
the australian beef was drowned into a tasteless mess
very disappointing , roof top dining room with view across to pearl tower we found the restaurant by accident and were delighted that they could give us a table when we hadnt a reservationthe tasting menu was a lovely treat and we really enjoyed the ambience the attentive staff and the view, we hadn�t a booking but given that we arrived right on opening time before its busy time we were delighted to get an excellent window table this gave marvellous views over the bund and across the river to pudong and its orchestra of lights

from the extensive menu we chose the mezze plate to begin next up was duck iranian style and the provencal fish stew all delectable we ended with the poppyseed cake and the rhubarb tart

the staff were lovely friendly and helpful altogether a special occasion, this is the third time i enjoy this restaurant first in 2012 and twice in 2016 not only the spectacular views but a wonderful seating terrace and well balanced menu together with a complete wine list make this one of my favourite places in shanghai last not least beside one can enjoy the glam and good choice of music i was happy to listen last version of leonard cohen you want it darker blended by famous dj kakbrenner
an example of balance and surprise, food here is french in approach and with the decor one feels like you are in 1920s era shanghai  really well done great cocktails and wine too there is a large outdoor terrace that offers excellent views of the bund and pu dong area across the river service was excellent too, after a crowded morning at yu garden walked over to m on the bund for lunch a great location on the 7th floor with both outdoor and indoor dining options with a wonderful view the weekend brunch menu provided a nice variety of starters squash soup tiny octopus salad and main courses pumpkin tortellini venison burger mediterranean sampler all of our dishes were well prepared with excellent taste

service was attentive and timely for a great afternoon gathering, the main selling point is the rooftop view over the bund which is spectacular
although you need a pleasant temperature to enjoy
the service was very good on this trip and
food excellent suckling pig and beef bourguignon were our mains
a great place to relax with good food and service, i agree with the other reviews that the food is soso so for its pricey cost you can spend your dinner money on some other place you can experience the view some place else

also if youre looking for an authentic shanghai  chinese dining experience this isnt the place  the food here is frenchasian fusion, one of the most fantastic restaurants in shanghai is the m on the bund
the atmoshophere is very nice and recommended for all type of dinner and lunch
the service very professional and speaks too good english
the food we had was just delicious the appetizers the main dish the dessert everything we had was just so tasty and nice presented
there are so many choices on the menu and on the wine list that you really do not know what to order
the restaurant has an indoors and outdoors area that has the most spectacular view
you could also smoke there outside if you want we really loved the space and congratulations to m team for the excellent job

regards, we enjoyed the food but it took almost an hour before we got our mains the service at the end of the night was excellent though we asked the maitre de to call us a taxi and then she walked us downstairs and into our awaiting taxi, i have been m on the bund numerous time almost every business trip we will be entertaining there on 119 we had a group of 11 people there again my brother is the host and i am the cohost i was the one who went through the wine list ask for the sommelier who was no help at all thank goodness i do know my wine after the round of cocktail the waiter came and took everyones order except mine i am not sure if it was intentional or absent minded but for a restaurant of this calibre this is totally unacceptable i know i am not queen of thailand or ferragamo but if i am the one in charge of picking the wine and ordering the wine it is too hard to miss that perhaps i am someone who is hosting the party when i complained to the manager they just kept on saying sorry but wanted to find out what i want so my order can catch up with the rest i had the braised lamb which was totally dry so i must say that in all 15 years that i have been going i found that the service is awful and the staff still cannot speak english fluently and the so call sommelier is nothing but arrogant to me they have gone from a 5 star restaurant to a 1 star the only 5 stars is the location service and food is absolutely disappointing no excuse is acceptable for forgetting to take the order of the person who is cohosting a party, went with my mother to have a saturday night dinner after a week around china we got seated in front with a fantastic view of pudong very hard to beat service is excellent had super fish which was cooked to perfection the desserts are to die for especially the pavlova had a super evening, it has been many year since we returned to m on the bund went with some friends and the quality of the food and service has not changed with time the food was fabulous and the view was incredible the service was outstanding everyone was very attentive to our table this is a must for dinner when you are in shanghai we look forward to our next meal with m on the bun, most enjoyable evening
food superb all members of the group  7 were delighted service was a bit faster than usually in restaurants in europe house vine good  but not as great as one would expect portions were of ideal size and well presented
the terrace with the pudong skyline across the river was something out of a fantasy, this is one of the international restaurant opened first in shanghai right on the bund love the decor mood lighting and service is impeccable  the food is delicious too we had a mix of middle eastern appetitizer humus etc then i had a delicious roast pork belly  husband had the lamb which is equally good the huge open terrace is a perfect venue for drinks overlooking the bund, enjoy hearty western food french and a fabulous view of the east one of the must try places when in shanghai try to book a table at the front of the restaurant with a nice view of course everybody is trying to do just that, a typhoon was passing by further south in china the night we went so there were high winds and heavy rain and needless to say we were already a bit soaked just getting there so we didnt venture out to the terrace probably was closed anyway we first went to their cocktail bar glam which was fun and festive and we had drinks at a great table looking out at the bar and the storm outside dinner was then delicious with great service we had been to their m restaurant in beijing which we thoroughly enjoyed and this one albeit more casual did not disappoint and was just what we needed after having been on a 3 week strenuous tour of china and tibet great location on the bund in a very classy older building, we are not foodies  so this review should not be considered critical of what was likely an amazing meal a limited menu but prepared with visible care and attention to detail i have absolutely no doubt that if you like to seek out the best meals in a city this should be your destination
but the location  at night  is amazing you are sitting on the rooftop of a 7floor building looking over the iconic shanghai skyline as it lights up and what a lightshow you will watch not to be missed, went to this restaurant this evening after reading many amazing reviews well it didnt disappoint
food is delicious i recommend the pumpkin soup followed by lamb my partner had dulling pig the service is first class and the manager very friendly and cant do enough for clients
it was too cold to sit outside but we went out to enjoy the views after our meal
favourite meal in shanghai so far, went there for a late midweek lunch the restaurant was fairly quiet as expected service was a little slow considering
but the food was impeccable we had the house specials  recommendations and every mouthful was like heaven we even had room for dessert and coffee
absolutely enjoyed the food service couldve been better but overall we had a fantastic time, i visited m on the bund many years agonot long after it openedbut my memories of said visit are a touch greyas i was a touch young and foolish then and part of a massive partythat was not paying particular attention to the quality of the fare

it is handy thus that i am now older and more discerning and was able to sit and really enjoy the experience of eating at this delightful restaurant the view from the balcony is to die forabsolutely spectacular the food compliments the view hugely and the ambience and quality of the service is excellent
i had the foie gras for a starterfavoured with sauterneswhich makes a change to the usual apple saucewhich was delightful

i was in need of a good steak for a mainalthough almost swayed by the suckling pig one would not normally expect a steak to be perfect in all aspects in shanghai i like my steak to be medium wellnot too keen on too much blood it was done to to perfection with some foie gras and mushrooms i showed my british roots by having chips served with it

mine host was excellenti forget his name but he has been there since it opened he advised on the wines and gave us an excellent incite into the menu
i did steal some of the suckling pigbartered against some french fries and it proved to be mouthwatering delicious

the desserts are very inventive but i chose the turkish coffee and baklava which is easily as good as that i have tasted in istanbul

i have to saythat even though i did not pay the billfor 5 of usincluding 2 bottles of good red winethe cost was very reasonable indeed one not to miss when in shanghai","bar",0.999746745070324
180,"introduced by a friend hidden behind an old door you enter to a romantic home style environment food absolutely great and super fresh a mustgo for couples, it is a very small restaurant you must knock a door which looks like a house door apart from the very small name as big as a business card it is just next a grocery there are two rooms total 2025 seats one chef who prepares delicious food but you have to wait for quite long time while waiting you can taste some good and expensive italian or french wine we were 8 friends and we had to wait about 90 minutes from the moment we ordered to the moment we finally got our appetizers followed later by the main course food is great but you must not be in a rush price is high but worth the food really excellent, delicious food in a home like ambience if you are desperate for a quiet and private place in shanghai and have dinner with your people you like to be around with racines is the place meanwhile i tried all the dishes on the chalk board menu and all of them are very very delicious a �must� is the foie gras dont get confused by the unremarkable entry ring the door bell enter �and enjoy, amazing really amazing food with an unbeatable pricequality ratio

we had the tuna mushroom as started and then the snapper and scallops as main delicious and incredible presentation

efficient service super nice staff a hidden gem in shanghai well be back, small hidden neighborhood gem that i have had the good fortune to frequent i wholeheartedly recommend it for its atmosphere and quality delicious food and beverage, japanese chef cooking french stylewell it is delicious hidden in the former french concession literally hidden even if you know the exact address it is tricky to find straight away nicely converted house with few tables in a very cozy ambient menu may seem small but when digging into it one realizes that it is very rich and wide in options and flavors
we tried several dishes and all of them were amazing by far best meat in town
foie risotto and duck were remarkably good too decently priced wine list and staff properly trained and nice
a truly great experience it is not cheap but it is not overpriced at all since you get what you paid for
i will repeat for sure, the japanese chef does wonders and serves fantastic dishes especially his foie gras bonbons the atmosphere is cosy and the service very good, the food was awesome french with a little twist mussels with lemon grass sauteed foie gras on salad with local sauce we had a great evening although we had a hard time finding it see previous comment
service is great but cooking was a little slow to have all dishes at the same time on the table, this place is not your usual french restaurant first you have to find it
its been set up in what was probably an apartment
you get in through a simple door no windows to the street
no restaurant sign
its run by japanese and they have probably the most authentic french food of shanghai
you have to book in advance they are always full and can only accommodate a handful of tables
a must try","Healthy",0.999805625843783
181,"the best dinner i ever have in shanghai amazing place cozy terrace incredible food and staff super attentive, had the good fortune of having a friend take us to this fantastic restaurant in shanghai she knew the chef carlos and he prepared for us an amazing 7 course tapas meal with a variety of different tastes we loved the foie grasw cherry and the fish soup it ends with a dessert that they light on fire dont forget to ask for the fernet it has a bit of a herbal taste but from a suggestion from a friend we tried it and its good for digestion

if you go to this restaurant hope you have the pleasure of meeting carlos very talented chef and offers first class service, the elefante patatas were the best not a lot of vegetarian options but the ones i had were good omelette  tomato soup also good, we found this restaurant in the backyard of a building a very relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff make it a really good location the food is excellent although not always typical spanish the wine list is also very good in total we had a very nice evening with really goodwine and food, you know when something is just right i came in for a glass of wine and some small bites on a friends recommendation and my expectations were more than exceeded the service was smart they recommended a fantastic rioja by the glass and the tapas exceptional for great food service and fun atmosphere look no further, came here so many times that i can say without doubts elefante is just amazing if by any chance you are in shanghai you cant miss it the terrace is one of the best in town but anyway during winter time you can enjoy the colourful atmosphere inside and the happy vibe the food is so delicious i hardly recommend the codfish and lobster phyllo triangles looks like a samosa and the brioche foie gras with maraschinosooo good the staff is very attentive especially the chef carlos he always come at our tables helping us with the menu and took very good care of us and made sure that everything went as we expectednever had a bad surprise, we went for dinner on xmas day and it was absolutely fantastic the chef carlos es exceptional and the dishes are simply delicious we enjoyed the cannelloni and the dessert with different sort of melted chocolates and turron spanish speciliaty was amazing i recommend booking in advance though we were lucky elefante is usually full we will definitely come back, great atmosphere great servicedelicious pretty expensive  but every body there is helpful and smiling, went out on a fridaynight just the two of us and decided to go to elifante we had high expectations because we really like el will and tomatito which are from the same chain it was fridaynight we made a reservation which wasnt necessary because the restaurant was nearly empty we ordered a bottle of wine and a cold platter the cold platter was rmb 180 the platter contained little meat for the price you pay had a few more warm tapas tasted nice but really very small payed almost rmb1600 and was still a little hungry o<u+fe0f> the location of the restaurant is great in the former french concession the atmosphere is nice food versus price >overrated, i was there on a friday night the area has now become a trendy spot with several bars around place was busy and on outdoor terrace they also added a bartruck  compared to previous dinner i had there i would say almost two years ago i would say i preferred before service is a bit messy manager is good but other staff not really our group of 7 had some issues with one dish and major issues once check came on how to charge different credit cards still anyway i would go back for sharing tapas concept and for easy dinner on outside patio food is just not the first reason i would return, i liked almost everything there from the backyard outdoor terrace to the indoor hacienda type of structure the restaurant is made like small areas cozy feeling that make you enjoy the food even more
the cocktails are nice and out of the ordinary lists you can usually order the food is tasty and simple nothing pretentious in the menu and thats what i liked you get what you order and everything tasted like you imagine it when you read the menu
the service is also caring without being overwhelming
ill go back for sure, overall a nice experience especially because the place is nice in the summer if not too hot i like sitting outdoor in the silent patio in a courtyard of the french concession

i have been several times in this restaurant and twice the last two weeks these last two weeks i had the same tapas set menu but very different service very good the first time very poor the second one the second time waiters did not come to our table with the right timing they let the glasses empty until they were reminded they left the leftover for too long in front of us they did not change the plates when needed even if we asked for it and they said of course probably some english communication problem� in fact at a certain point we asked for a mosquito repellant and they came back with two boxes of matches or probably we should have killed the mosquitos with a fire overall we had a nice dinner but the poor service of the last time made me think that the same tapas set menu i had the previous time was not that special two of the red wines we tried by the glass were pretty bad the rioja by the glass is not recommend while the wine by the bottle was better it is a restaurant where you average spend rmb 400 per person so i expect things would work better all this said i will certainly go back to lelefante for his cheerful atmosphere and for its tapas
note i have booked it via tripadvisor and it seems it does not really work no confirmation email therefore better to give them a call, we went to elefante with a group of moms and babies it was a nice clean air and sunny day and the restaurant reserved a table for us outside there was enough space for all the strollers and in the beginning the staff was quite responsive and fast the lunch special was yummy though the portion is not big however we had to wait for a long time for our dessert and had to remind the servers a few times, went there last weekend and i must say things have gone downhill ive been here a few times but the last trip left nothing to be desired food was not inspiring 6 of us went with vary good previous experience but no one left feeling it was a good dinner lets just say i cant really remember what i ate

on the plus side the outdoor place looks prime for a good brunch session, the patio is really enjoyable nice place calm you feel like youre out of shanghai while in the centre of the french concession
we only tried tapas and salad aspargus beef pita veal carpaccio spicy pepper stuffed with ratatouille and mushroom salad

i cant say it was not good but i can say it was prepared with poorly fresh ingredients and mainly of low quality
the mini pita did not taste like beef at all there was some kind of sauces like mayonnaise in many tapas making it impossible to taste anything else the aspargus were the big white one not fresh little green aspargus the mushroom salad was supposed to be composed of artichoke one piece in the whole salad
i felt like i was eating industrial food prepared from cans and supermarket sauces

we ordered also juices orange juice was fresh cranberry juice was clearly not

in total 4 tapas 1 small salad and 2 juices 513rmb and believe me the tapas are not big
there are many stuff available for bbq maybe we will try another time but for now its very expensive for the quality the serve youre probably paying the location, absolutely loved this restaurant location was ideal restaurant was beautifully decorated with a laid back mediterranean vibe the food was simply delicious and the staff were super friendly i will definetly be coming back next time i am in shanghai and would highly recommend to anyone visiting, hidden away off the road this spanish tapas bar is worth a visit the food is excellent not necessarily the cheapest but we had a very good meal you can even go and just sit at the bar for a drink there are also a couple of dining rooms for groups, have been here a couple of times for work and pleasure head chef julio is very good and makes a point of coming out to say hello ask what we enjoyed the most and talk through any questions on the dishes the patatas bravas are well worth a try theyre a different take on the usual possibly better imho its also nice to come to a place in shanghai and get items like hummus which they make themselves its also great value  a meal for three including five sharing tapas generous portions alcohol and water came to around <u+00a3>33 a head they also have a beautiful garden and host regular events including food trucks with dishes and guest chefs from around the world if you live in shanghai this place is a bit of an institution you should be coming already if youre visiting and want to go home raving about finding an authentic spanish restaurant in shanghai this is a good place for you happy memories , especially compared to how inexpensive you can eat in shanghai this will not be a lowbudget meal but i loved every bit we really enjoyed sharing many tapas style dishes and the unique flavor a at this fusion restaurant the octopus was great as well as the sangria the staff was attentive and very helpful navigating the menu plus its on a fun street with other bars to have a drink at after, i have been to elefante twice now and absolutely recommend it to anyone visiting shanghai the mussels are particularly good will be back, during a 5 week stay in shanghai i visited this restaurant twice

the food decor and service was fantastic if not a bit pricey the wine selection is wonderful the tapas were very good and the ribs are something special overall this restaurant delivered in every area

there is outdoor dining during the right time of year even though the mistake we made was that we ate outside on a 28 degree night

this isnt the cheapest restaurant you will eat in but price should be a secondary consideration as the food here is excellent, upscale tapas restaurant located off the street nice atmosphere and good food
reservations suggested, very laid back environment and delicious eats price is a little steep but its worth it for the occasional visit had iberian cold cuts ceviche seafood paella and sangria, revisited shanghai after living there for years and picked out elfante as one of my togo places for a weekend brunch sorely disappointing the cooking tasted more chinese than mediterraneanthe patatas lamb stew and fried asparagus tasted like theyd been plucked out of a chinese cookbook in hindsight im glad i didnt order a paella i couldnt have kept it together if they served me fried rice the food itself wasnt too bad  above average but not awesome my point being if i wanted chinese food there are a ton of places i could have gone to at half the price why go to a mediterranean restaurant my companion was of course unimpressed such a shame because i clearly remember much better food circa 2014 as for the wait staff they were generally friendly and attentive  once you get their attention most of the time they stood by the kitchen chatting instead of keeping an eye on diners perhaps it was a slow sunday, this place is on donghu road just off of huaihai road on a lively strip with plenty of bars and restaurants i was taken by a friend who said the place is pretty good just a bit pricy but considering what you get it is not bad they have great martinis as well and a garden which looks nice but was closed due to weather also they have a separate bar in the back called dumbo bar where you can eat as well and where one can smoke we went for tapas as we did not want to have a heavy meal but were not aware that the portions are actually pretty big so it was a bit too mud but we loved all of it my absolut favorite was the chorizo with eggdid not sound exciting but i wanted chorizo and i am happy i got this one a true mouthgasm chorizo with a fried egg sunny side up capers onions tomatoes and some gravy this in a mixture was very nice and the first time i had chorizo in this combination the waiters were also helpful with wine recommendations and since i chose a version that is sold by glass or bottle the waiter offered to first let me have a try the staff was super professional yet super nice not as snobbish as you find them at times in the better places in shanghai and for the ladiesa few of the waiters were really handsome  the place is lively nice decorated and even though upper end very comfortable i can definitely recommend it to go out with friends or even for a business dinner plus you have another bar options next to it if you feel like doing more after your dinner btw they have a pretty extensive wine listdid not check details as i asked for recommendations but it was huge, we came here for a late lunch and had a mix of tapas a sangria on white wine not really my cup of tea food was good and the gazpacho absolutely excellent the best i ever had nice sitting outdoors in a well arranged garden and getting away from the hooting crazy street when you are tired and slightly confused by the hustle bustle of shanghai  as we arrived late i noticed that a lot of people came for what looked like a really scrumptious high tea coming directly from thailand i said oh this is cheap until i realized that we were talking rmb so the prices are hefty, nice ambiance good tapas selection and a great wine list
limited dessert menu but doesnt disappoint, there are many alternatives but this is my goto western restaurant in the french concession the service food and drinks are consistently excellent its good to see willy here on a regular basis minding the shop he is super creative very good to his employees and has a wonderful passion for his work the result is a quite special dining experience, this restaurant is a nice restaurant with a nice venue very cosy and romantic the food is not so bad but better order a lot since the tapas is so small the wine choice very good but and i say but the service is skittle slow and they are not so helpful however its a good place to go for dinner , elefante is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai the sangria alone is worth the trip the food is always tasty and it is super for set lunch or dinner with a big group since the menu is tapasstyle the more folks you have the more you can all try and it is all a treat, a well decorated place tucked away from the incessant honking of shanghai mindless drivers this is a huge plus the food is very good  maybe coz we paid rmb400each without drinks better to make dinner reservation it is that popular, we were invited there for a big group dinner and we were shocked that we did not know this place earlier it is hidden from the street so you need to know about it we were so happy we went there soon after to give it another try first time it was very hot and we were sitting inside second time we went for the outside garden which is very very pleasant altogether we tried more than 10 different dishes and most of them were absolutely perfect lamb tagging was bit to sweet for our taste grilled sardines steak calamari salad grilled shrimps bill was not small but we got what paid far and we will be coming back for more especially that elefante is located in our favourite part of shanghai  former french concession with our favourite massage parlour citron just around the corner xin le rd, excellent food very nice location and details and also high level service the bill is very expensive even for shanghai but for sure its a very good choice, innovative dishes alongside excellent classical food such as jamon nice garden when weather allows, trying to be too clever for its own good i have no idea why this restaurant is so highly rated if our saturday brunch is anything to go by a real confusion of flavours and poor basic ingredients plus arrogant service meant we left halfway through the deal where the idea of a hot dog on a brunch comes from just about sums this place up wine choice by glass is very poor only 2 white and 2 red which in no way reflects what is usually served in a meditteranean eating place the only bright spot was the pea and mint soup prices were above average for the quality on offer, tapas bites are a bit too fancy resulting in high prices compared to quality of the food the garden is nice however quite some noise as a result of construction works adjacent to the garden, our hotel recommended this  it was a sound choice in the french concession area clearly frequented by local expats space is great some nice greenery  plenty of room between tables there were about 10 of us  all were content with dishes from spanish to italian
there starters were tapas  antipasto i had a memorable pork with 2 seperate sauce bowls of plum  a vinegarchillielemon grassmix others had risotto calamari  pizza the menue is quite extensive so choice is not an issue
we had a french rose quite reasonable for china price about 350 rmb per head which included winewe would return, this restaurant used to be el willies which moved and this place is now called elefante the menu might have changed but amazing food i must say we picked a few items of the menu one better than the other picked a wine which was one of the cheaper ones but amazingly good the portions are not small considering they are all tapas size for two adults we shared 4 and a dessert the lava cake great meal, we went to el willy sister restaurant elephante on donghu lu on sunday for brunch we havent eat at el willy since it has moved to the bund but i remember it was good in terms of food and ambience

so when we have friends came for visit we thought of it again bearing the name of el willy we believed that the standard of elephante wont be too bad

it was a total misperceptions a group of 16 pax some friends ordered brunch set menu and some ordered a la carte

the brunch menu was a complete disaster food was bad it was not the same as we ate a few years back the worst thing is we found the food quality very different for brunch set and a la carte

there was seafood paella in the set and we ordered the same paella a la carte it turned out the one under the set menu was overcooked and too wet the a la carte version was a lot better we knew there was price difference in set menu and a la carte but it shouldnt be an excuse for serving suck food should we go for the food in the same restaurant it has to keep the same standard thats call professionalism by realizing a premium restaurant treat food in such a way we were so disappointed

their service was poor too i dont bother to elaborate more on this aspect

so please dont ever go elephante for brunch and i doubted their other food too

as the mother company i hope el willy could do a better job in quality control and servicing

this terrible experience also affect our confidence in el willy just feel sorry, i have been here many times
its recommended in any season in summer you can take a table outside to enjoy the cozy backyard in the center of shanghai
enjoy the spanish cuisine wine and lovely background music
the place is closed on mondays, please be aware that following a lunchtime visit to  elefante my friend and i were violently sick the following day we ate the set menu including smoked chicken  we think that the chicken was to blame please be warned we intend to report the episode to the relevant authorities, after 5 o 6 times we found that the dishes are always surprising in the brunch we asked to the chef and he say that they don t repeat menu only after 6 month they can repeat a dish they are adapting to the different seasons so i really recommend it to the tripadvisor readers, there are a number of restaurants here bearing the same address and this eatery is inside a small culdesac look out for the huge multicolored paper mache elephant at the main walkway there have an outside patio but we chose to sit inside due to the smokers there if you are wearing heels be careful as your heel may fall into the cracks between the patio planking as was what happened to my wife a couple of times

service was very quick and the entire meal actually only took about 35 minutes at first impression the series of tapas did not look substantial but at the end we felt full

we started with a complimentary bruschetta followed by seafood soup

for appetisers my wife had the mini pitas with chicken  there was rather a lot of cumin in the filling i had the grilled wild squid and it was fabulous  in fact we both agreed that was the best dish of the entire meal

for mains i had the cannelloni while she had the seafood risotto both were good but nothing to rave about

it was rather crowded and rather noisy at lunch  there was a large group of expat women in the corner and they were rather boisterous  but i guess that adds to the festive atmosphere

am reposting this as ta lost around 25 of my previous reviews which were therefore not published, this is the 3rd time we come to this place and brunch is really good

5 middle size dishes including soup salad nice squid and great rissoto also fair price and free for the kids very recommended, el efante was recommended by a friend and truly lived up to the expectations the restaurant looks great inside the terrace outside was perfect since the weather was very gentle we ended up sharing eight courses and all were very good as the first course we had oysters and they are great the other dishes had some very interesting combinations and tasted very good if you are in the neighborhood pay a visit and you wont be disappointed, tastes were good specially meloso rice and the cream caramel with icecream was really amazing
rest of dishes were quite correctmay be a little price anyway definitely is a good place in shanghai for mediterranean food, excellent food good tapas just ane advice if they tell you one paella is for 34 except if you are on a diet dont buy it
paella is so delicious that 2 people will finish it easy

at the end nice place in my opinion a little bit overpriced
but probably the best paella in town, the restaurant is amazing with a outside area it was to hot so we stay inside for dinner
we could be anywhere in europe
service perfect with great tapas but i am here to say please order the paella and the burrata cheese
with the paella on the table you understand that you are in a spanish restaurant
if in shanghai dont miss the elefante
mercia and goncalo, came across this place by chance as its set back from the street it could be missed thankfully we saw it and were able to enjoy a lovely tapas lunch on a hot shanghai afternoon lots of outdoor seating but would need to reserve to ensure a seat we had to sit indoors but that was no hardship in fact probably a relief from the heat
staff were efficient if not but felt a few more smiles may have helped
lots of tasty things to choose from but beware of high cost of sliced cold cuts and hams we ordered 2 from the cols section and 3 from the hot strangely the cold potato dish came hot however this didnt spoil anything the fois gras tapas was delicious and the lamb in pita divine
i loved the croquettes too
it would be nice to sit outside on a cooler day the place had a good atmosphere and i can imagine in the evening it would be very lively
just a pity our servers werent a bit more friendly saying that on the way out we were approached and asked how everything was and they hoped they would see us again i think they will, just visited for the 2nd time in 3 months el elefante and decided that my first impression is not a oneoff adding to todds review i will note that the customer service is improved and although this type of restaurant attracts difficult clients the team seems to manage very well
the patio  terrace area is well balanced and you can enjoy yourself without feeling other guests too close to you
the food as other reviewers pointed out is well balanced with many new ideas that are inspiring without becoming to extreme there is still a 3rd of menu to enjoy simple tapas and i must add that my fellow diners spanish mexican and greeks found the sangria exceptional
several dishes are worth exploring but my advice is to listen to advice form the staff members on how to complement various dishes and drinks
normally i find these type of restaurants are not good value for money but el elefante is just right for a good night out and definitely as good as el willy if not better","Italian cuisine",0.999804466789076
182,"simple tasty healthy spacious place 3 floors and outdoor space so no need to wait for a table affordable price good service, didnt except it to be so nice international food at international standards fresh blended juices and quesadilla, my second visit to this fabulous healthy restaurant and wasnt disappointed i had the best most filling cobb salad i have ever tasted
there is something here for every taste and both eating indoors and outside
and the juices are out of this world i had a spring cleanse with my salad and i am so full i can hardly move
finally the staff are efficient helpful and most of all friendly i will be back, i was surprised how good the steak and vegetables were another group said they had a great steak there so i tried it for lunch and was not disappointed it was great, i must admit i am a big fan of element fresh and whenever i travel in china i make sure i have one meal there the food is consistent no matter which city no matter which branch the food is fresh and tastes great in a way simple and tasty western food nothing super fancy but superbly executed whether salads sandwiches or pastas all are great the asian food is also very good definitely a great casual restaurant cant go wrong with a meal there, if you need fresh food or good vegetarian options look no further than element fresh this is a staple for me in shanghai it is reliably good healthy decent service they have awesome smoothies juices salads and refreshing entrees, i often come here to grab lunch as they have tasty salads and freshly squeezed juices this is my standby as its close to our office, after settling back shanghai again  decided to give a shot to my old time favourite the menu is massive and there is a bit of everything for every body taste i picked their set menu which consists mediterranean plate beef fillet  baked apple spring roll and wine pairing  the menu is 288 and if you pick wine pairing additional 70 rmb which is ok for 3 glass of wine

but there was not nothing above average the only average was the beef fillet  it was tender and a ok fillet but its marination and mushroom sauce burnt my stomach the mediterranean plate comes with a basket of toasted bread 2 types of olives mushroom and a carpaccio like stuff all even the toasted bread which lack of flavour came cold and tasteless
baked apple spring roll was the most weird taste and could be skipped

i guess i would stop going to element fresh for a while but with this quaility it is better stick to their paste selections only, nice restaurant in the hearth of xintiandi perfect for a quick lunch very tasty juices and huge pprtions of the main dishes, great for juices salads and low calorie options enjoyed lunch at this locations multiple times try the green juice, in shanghai for five days from england and we just fancied a western style breakfast

theres nothing wrong with this place good service food we perfectly fine but all in it just felt a bit fake the area around is a westernised shopping street  we have a place like this about 20km from home where new is made to look like old

well unsurprisingly thats what we got coffee that wasnt quite hot a lovely salad and bean affair that wasnt hot or cold and omelette plus lots of trimmings all certainly good enough but we should have known better, great food and quick service the menu is long but the options are good and varied some a little on the small size like the stews so make sure you order a starter or dessert, element fresh is one of those places where the menu rarely changes the meals are average but consistent and the coffee is below par i usually head here for lunch meetings because the tables upstairs are relatively large and we can discuss issues in a nice clean environment this is a chain store and wherever you see an element fresh you can pretty much expect the same, if compared to any fast food restaurant in the us the food for me was only average the meal was definitely fresh but the service and ambiance was only average, ask the waitress to bring a glass for my beer she refused she said it is ok to drink with bottle but not caring how i was feeling not going to take any food there if the staffs are not caring for their costumers feeling how could the food be good, popular chain that serves great healthy dishes salmon and chickengood drinks my favourite is the vitamin burst efficient and friendly servicebut it comes at a certain price , price is reasonable portion is large enough ingredients are fresh a good place to relax during daytime and with a group of friends for drinks at night, this has become a large chain in shanghai and perhaps beyond as the name suggests they specialize in fresh salads and juices but the menu has expanded into pastas and local food

food and service is passable  nothing stands out  the pasta i ordered today is a bit blah though my avacado drink is interesting, this restaurant located in a very prime location serves a wide range of food as well as plenty of healthy choices very generous portions too i enjoy my breakfasts here and loved watching the hustle and bustle of xintiandi from here, we visited shanghai for 5 days and ended up having a quiet chardonnay  beer here 4 out of the 5 days good people watching nice wine and attentive service we didnt eat here but only because we wanted to eat asian  shanghai cuisine but what we saw served european looked good, we really ate well here because this place serves amazing continental food little language problem and extensive menu free soup is delicious salads are amazing, element  not so  fresh is by reputation a nice place to go especially the one in xintiandi pedestrian steert so we did all of us had a salad me a chicken one only a few hours later there was no question what have happened my hospital bill was several thousand rmbs the chef said he apologize and offered us a free round havent dared to go again  yet ok its bad luck but also a sign of kitchen practice, element fresh is my guilty pleasure in shanghai im embarrassed at how much i like the food here recommendations include

1 club sandwich amazing
2 cobb salad
3 chicken qessadila even for breakfast
4 breakfast burrito
5 cucumber lemonade, i like element fresh have eaten here several times and i have always been happy with my food the service is good and the quality of the food is great they have happy hour 21 for house wine cocktails and beer until 20 in the evening i love their caribbean steak salad nice beef sliced on a green salad with avocado och grilled pineapple its mainly western food but some dishes have asian spices
this is not a quick lunch place so be sure to have time when you eat here, after having a full lunch we came here early evening to enjoy appetizers cocktails and desserts we were not disappointed we had a mediterranean  hummus plate cheese plate and rice pudding all was fantastic, the food was great so are the cocktails price performance is a bit over the service could be nicer a smile would make it waiting time for the food is quite long, located in the newly made old xintiandi this place offers all the classical of element fresh nice fruitveggie fresh juices and quite a choice of salad warm dishes service is efficient this element fresh is quite big some seats outside and 3 levels inside
pricequality is good, within the historic renovated shikumen this cafe has a friendly atmosphere with quality food good coffee  reasonably priced, best value resturant in this area

highly recommend their lobster freshly done served with beautiful rice in coconut sauce other dishes are as good too, there is a generous offering of fresh smoothies ice cream and other food being offered here the one at xintiandi comprises of three stories it is well priced environment is comfortable and service is brisk without being intrusive the only downside here is that there is at times an extensive queue of people queuing up to use the bathrooms apart from that you wont be short changed by spending some time here commendable, this was my third visit to elements fresh and the first one to this branch i have grown fond of their quesadilla and more so since they are happy to customize it and make it vegetarian

the staff was friendly as always but their manager grace was really very nice i was with my parents and she took special care that they felt comfortable, me and my mom eat there twice for dinner and one for breakfast we were tired after all day walking around the city and our hotel was in xintiandi you dont need a reservation and its not a fancy place were you feel uncomfortable if you have the wrong dress or shoes its a easy and well design place easy and relaxing food is various and really really good wine is good too and staff is super nice maybe a bit slow if there are too many people sitting but is a nice spot with outside space you wont be disappointed i suggest to try thai dishes and fish, have enjoyed lunch at different element fresh restaurants enjoyed the food on offer service was efficient staff spoke english and attentive definitely a place to try this particular vintage element fresh is located in an interesting area nice to wander around in, i came here for lunch on a weekend and the place was packed

service  prompt accomodating staff

food  the spicy seafood linguine was very tasty i loved it the puer chocolate tea was warm not hot hot chocolate or even tea should be hot the taste of puer is quite strong but i think it would be tolerable if it was hot i didnt enjoy my drink i didnt trink it after a few sips

basically based on pasta alone i would be coming back plus the service was really good, the lunch menu was quite extensive and the food quality was indeed fresh my only suggestion is to train the staff to be more knowledgeable with the food provided and to communicate with the customer with more confidence i realize this is a constant challenge for all restaurantors in china keep at it, just discovered element fresh and so glad i did great lunch menu and live the salads which is something you crave in shanghai another favorite is the greek lamb kebab freshly squeezed juices are really freshly squeezed and delicious, this is the second time we visited this restaurant in 6 months as before the orders we had tasted good and were generous in size service friendly and ambience cozy will keep coming back, great place to have breakfast lunch or dinner very extensive menu great smoothies for a quick meal on the run, once of the most contant place in shanghai food is always good and the service is effective i always go for the laffa bread salad and the hummus, good salads nice lunch place simple food service is normally ok most of the food seems fresh and there is a reasonable range of choice nothing special but a reasonably consistent change and this is true at this location, i have been here several times during the past years i liked it every time ive had salad and sandwiches and they have been great every time try their juices interesting mixes of flavor and taste good service attentive staff, i have been to another branch of the same restaurant on the trip to shanghai with my husband
good food good ambience staff speaks little english as i have been to another branch finding vegetarian food was not a big challenge they have sitting outside as well as inside
the problem faced here was again as i faced in haagen dazs beggars cum asking for while you are sitting outside which i feel is really bad they should take some steps to avoid such things
it so pleasant to sit in lovely surrounding and enjoy your food suddenly there someone standing next to you begging for some money
its disturbing, this restaurant was very close to our hotel and we ate there for breakfast twice in a week the waitstaff had a little difficulty with english but really not a problem in the end the food was fine for breakfast, my wife comes here often for lunch and weve eaten various other meals here we usually come for the salads especially the cobb salad and the laffa bread salad the portions are large and my wife usually takes home enough leftovers for another meal
the last few lunches my wife has had here have been marked with very poor service servers forget to bring things cant understand very basic requests such as asking for a box to take home food and are generally hard to flag down and very short with customers the last time my wife had lunch here she had to ask for a box multiple times she had ordered the same salad as her friend and they took both plates away at the same time and then brought the boxes of leftovers back together in the same bag making it difficult to tell which salad belonged to which person they were able to tell them apart but the staff should have kept them separate to begin with
overall the food is good and very fresh but the service makes us want to order their delivery option instead of going in to the restaurant, we visited here for the first time and were pleasantly surprised there is a large choice of dishes made from fresh ingredients the portions are generous seating pleasant inside and outside at the boardwalk and staff very helpful will certainly come back, came for lunch with a reserved table order taken and most of the food arrived as expected  one main missing which was resolved when raised no follow up from staff coffees ordered to be served at the completion of the mains  had to chase hard to get at all this was all whilst using locals for the communication when the restaurant was not that busy

overall good food but average service, came here for lunch on monday i like the location on donghu rd and decided to check this one for a change the menu is great  large selection of healthy dishes i just ordered fresh cucumber and aloe juice and club sandwich more than one hour from in to out food is very good but keep in mind that place is very busy and service is loooooong, excellent fresh and healthy options of food and a good price range not a posh place but good service and i would recommend, i have eaten at several of the eement fresh venues and while my favorite is the xujiahui one they are all of a similar high standard the vegetables are fresh as the name suggests the meals are appealing and the service is attentive the menu is solid though as several reviewers have pointed out it would be nice to see some more variety in the asian offerings but there isnt a dish that cannot be enjoyed, if i want to eat something healthy this place is a good choice for your lunch

i prefer to eat salad here their papaya salad is really good salmon salad is also very tasty sandwhiches and juices are all good service is pretty ok but could be slightly friendlier prices are bit on the high side","dumpling restaurant",0.999692361428605
183,"decor and service were underwhelming but food was excellent we had the chicken broth dumplings the sichuan style fried chicken dry fried string beans spinach noodles and a mango yogurt drink we had to ask for rice three times before we got it though i especially liked the dumplings chicken and string beans

we didnt get a table by the window but try to ask for one if you can the view is quite nice, we went twice in our week long visit in shanghai we love their signature roasted chicken the steam pork steamed gourd with garlic
service really varies with individual waiterwaitress, the concierge at ritzcarlton recommended this place she had previously recommended south memory for hunan cuisine and it was an excellent choice so we took her recommendation of south beauty for sichuan we were not disappointed the food was terrific it was only packed with locals but mostly those out on a date or a special occasion the service was friendly and attentive the food was excellent and the drinks were reasonably priced the restaurant has a huge menu  very helpfully presented with pictures and english translation will certainly go back here, i went here with work and we had some kind of tasting menu the food was fantastic very nice food and apparently very genuine for china, located on the 10th floor of the super brands mall this chinese chain restaurant offers some of the best views of the bund from pudong south beauty offers a number of private rooms 5 people plus open space seating and a roof top dining area thats great during the summer the dishes are generally of very good quality and cover a range of chinese cuisines seating along the window front as well as private rooms usually require a minimum spend and reservation best for dinner or lunch with larger groups pricing is slightly above average but not too expensive, south beauty is an upscale hunan and sichuan =szechuan chain restaurant they are located at the 10th floor with a great view over the bund it is yours if you agree to a cover charge which is 200+ rmb per person however it is negotiable or you can sit inside without a view which is a bit dull the food is well made authentic spicy and quite oily they have very expensive dishes but also reasonably priced ones i recommend reservations this place is popular i<u+00b4>m sure i will go there again, the food is not the best sichuan food in shanghai but the dining area and view is the best sichuan in shanghai if you are around tv tower area or shopping mall good alternative to spend your dinner, my meal was very good prawns delicious and the pork stir fry full of flavour however my husbands vegetarian dishes not so good fried rice was bland and basically uneatable
service was slow i would have liked another drink but by the time we could get someone to acknowledge us i couldnt be bothered even getting our bill was an effort
overall not a great impression and wouldnt be in a hurry to go back, my wife and i ate here on our last night in shanghai had hoped for a fancy night out but service was slow and food was average ironically it took even longer to get the bill than the food

my wifes prawn dish was probably the best while my vegetarian fried rice was bland stodgy and questionable on ingredients

it is one of these places that probably has too many food options instead having fewer choices and doing them well would be better

nit a place i plan to try again especially when there are so many other restaurants in the same building, we ordered the scallion buns the south beauty rice and the vegetable noodle dish and they all had meat in them though you never wouldve guessed given the descriptions and photos  also host services were very bad neglectful servers were nice though, we got the view and nothing else than the view this is summarizing our experience at our arrival we were placed outside in the terrace where the view is indeed wonderful we were seated on very uncomfortable bench and getting rather cold outside but again view was fantastic
we were given the menus and we started watching them but 30 minutes after our arrival we were still waiting to somebody to place our order
so we decided to leave, years ago i ate at another branch of south beauty and remember being impressed so i took my wife there this evening we were utterly disappointed this branch feels run down with scuffed floors dirty glasses worn out menus there was a path to the restroom that was partially taped off as though if you walked on that particular section youd fall through
the help wasnt helpful at all they seemed poorly trained at best milling about unable to understand when we wanted a check unable to understand that we wanted our wine chilled unable to understand that we wished to know if they took a visa cc all our food came at once
the food is whats most important of course i could forgive all of the above if the food was wonderful but in total it fell short of what you can get at an average american suburban chinese restaurant we ordered
a lamb chops
b minced beef with chilis in lettuce cups
c string beans
d dan dan noodles
e wontons in chili sauce

the lamb chops were brutally overcooked mutton mutton is gamy but the least you can do is not turn it to shoe leather alas this was industrial leather it came with a bit of spice to dip it in a ridiculous dish for almost $3000
the minced beef in lettuce cups was okay not special whatsoever many american restaurants make this far better
the string beans werent blistered and were of little interest
the dan dan noodles were overcooked and almost devoid of flavor such a shame since this can be a wonderful exciting dish
the wontons suffered the same fate as the noodles
worst of all the wine was undrinkable you cant buy wine here by the glass so we settled on an inexpensive bottle of rose it tasted like kool aid we couldnt drink it this cost us $6000
the view from the restaurant was wonderful
this is a lousy restaurant i would never eat here again, the restaurant is definitely aging there are two entrances and one of them is in bad need for improvement
service is ok no one speaks english but all food has pictures of it on menu a little unprofessional they push you to order a lot and to order more expensive we were only two and we ordered a ton of food you can see my pictures but he was asking us to order beef instead of saying that is plenty
the view over bund is great
food was good and spicy except for eggplant dish  all was tasty
great price considering the amount of food we ordered, located in the 10th floor of the super brand mall the restaurant have fabulous views of the bund on the opposite bank of the river however a seat at the window requires a 200 rmb minimum consumption i came here between 3 and 4 pm and the place was pretty much empty so i could have a look before and after my meal no objections to that by the staff
food was good the shredded sweet and sour pork was good but not special while beef with orange peel was quite excellent both were good filling portions the menu generally offers a good choice, this restaurant is located on the 10th floor of the super brand mall next to the oriental tv tower the elevators usually wont reach the 10th floor but you can go to 8th floor and then take the escalators to reach the 10th floor

we were seated in front of the glass window so we can enjoy the great view of huang pu river and the buildings of pu xi right across the river

we ordered 2 of the best menu of the restaurants the beef cooked in burning oil and the special fried chicken of south beauty the chicken was served with its cage the others are a bowl of vegetable soup and a plate of fried noodle

the beef is cooked in the burning oil in front of your table the taste is very very nice spicy and salty with the smell of chinese herbs as for the excessive oil the waiter would give you some bread to absorb the oil

the waiters were polite and attentive enough the price for our lunch was around 500rmb quite reasonable remembering it has good service delicious food and a nice scenery through the window

worth trying, this place is located in super brand mall 10th floor west lu jia zui road we were seated along the window area facing the huangpu river and thus has a fabulous view of the scenary and lights along the river the food was better than good the fish lip soup was average but the fish boneless and the flesh removed and rolled into pieces to recreate the whole fish again lots of work chinese bacon was served with a thin slice of cucumber the sauce that comes along with it was very tasty indeed frog legs fried szechaun style was next and it did not disappoint the thinly sliced pigs ear and the mixed herbal vegetable dish ends the meal the waitress was perpetually standing near our table waiting to serve and her service was really attentive truly a place for good food and a fantastic view, this is a chain or restaurants and there are a few in shanghai so just watch that you get the right one as they are all set differently although standard and cuisine is the same

we visited this one for business with a chinese colleague which was lucky as many of the staff speak very limited english and although the menu came with pictures it was very extensive so would have perhaps been quite daunting without a mandarin speaker there

views over the river and the old town including the original hsbc old colonial building were stunning

food was delicious  szechuan cuisine so quite spicy but less so than ive had in szechuan itself and very nice try the chicken with dried chilli looks outrageously spicy when you see it but the drying and frying of the chillies has taken out the heat and because it is dry without oil or sauce the heat is pleasant rather then extreme

a good selection of wines too service of the drinks was a bit slow and we were well into the food before the wine arrived which is a point for improvement

quite a good place to bring people for dinner on business although when you first arrive in the mall and work your way up the the 10th floor its easy to wonder if youve perhaps come somewhere that is a bit fast food  inauthentic thats not the case once you get into the restaurant itself

getting up to the 10th floor is not immediately obvious and again we were very lucky that we had a mandarin speaker with us you need to go to the 8th in a normal shopping mall lift and then ask someone for the way when you get to the 10th, we were taken to this restaurant on a business trip by good chinese supplier great food my wife doesnt do seafood but that was no problem our chinese colleague ordered most of the dishes for us all in all a lovely meal, cool interior as always in this chain of restaurants the food is top notch and quite pricey but still value for money some tables have minimum charge beware if not really hungry, had a business dinner with our supplier here and the food was great lots of selection menu was probably 20 pages luckily our host ordered, at the top of the mall this restaurant has great space and makes good use of it with its sweeping long rooms we had lunch here during which we ate too much as the food was mostly very good and made for easy sharing as is the norm service was efficient although if something could not be said by us in broken mandarin or by pointing it was an issue not an issue for the majority of customers but for nonmandarin speakers it does make a difference even if the menu is all pictures which helps a lot prices were a little higher than i would have liked but in a mall in the centre of shanghai it is unreasonable to be surprised, we went here with a large group of 30 multinationals the food was very unique and beautiful it is a great group bonding experience as you all experiment with food as simple as spicy carrots as beautiful as a bridge of pork ribs and as adventurous as duck tongue the service was also exceptional one down side was that our room did not have windows but we didnt notice, although they have 200 rmbperson minimum consumption not sure if in the whole restaurant or only on terrace area it is amazing the food is excellent and just the right spicyness for me i think my tolerance is above average western but clearly below local thai or indians excellent variety of dishes

but you come here for the view the view at night on the bund is so amazing

and here comes the only disadvantage the tables are pretty big and if you are only two persons its not so convenient to talk but hey shut up and watch the ships go by 

the waiters normally do not speak any english but we always got what we wanted, i would easily rate this as one of my best ever dinner so far
they are located nest to the oriental tower inside a mall on its 10th floor offering unparalleled views of the bund and the tower you would feel heavenly the resto is huge and they offer indoor outdoor and private room dinners for big groups

they mainly serve szichuan cuisine which is a bit spicy but the way the food is presented and garnished is out of the world we were a big group and ordered more than 10 dishes and there was no qualms with even none my full marks to these guys

this is a expensive place and you should at least budget for 300 rmb per person , the view of the restaurant is awesome located at the bund it is spicy szechuan food restaurant there is almost no one speak english that we had a hard time to understand what we should choosedespite this we ordered tasty dishes, my colleague and i were invited by our chinese business partner here to have dinner with his family as well as another chinese family
we were placed by the window with direct view to the river and puxi side of shanghai
food and service was excellent, sat outside on a beautiful spring evening the food was exceptional the view even better you would never realize that you were in a mall, the food is pretty good here but the place is not at same level of the south beauty at jingan sad rooms and furniture the environment is depressing, as the final part of a two day workshop in shanghai a group of 15 of us went to south beauty for dinner hosted by the local manager
we had a separate room with a table that had the largest lazy susan i had seen for a long time with people coming at different times to the restaurant there was difficulty in getting the service tuned and a good atmosphere initially but once we were all seated it fell nicely into place
both menus were extensive food and drink and though we didnt stretch the latter too much extending only to tsingtao beer red wine red tea and a potent local spirit referred to somewhat misleadingly as chinese water but i had presumed was baijiu our host did a magnificent job of ordering a vast array of soups dumplings dim sum mains and dessert
the food just seemed to keep coming and we struggled to clear dishes on said lazy susan before the next batch arrived in truth towards the end of the evening much of it was two deep
there were some stand out dishes pork served on the bonerib achingly tender and cooked in five spice pork dumplings silky tofu in a spicy chilli brothsauce whole fish that was both moist and meaty at the same time and a sticky red pork belly
i take my hat off to my colleagues who still had room for dessert which was a deep fried ricepotato ball with sesame seeds outside and a sweet rice paste inside which im guessing would keep out any dunkin donutskrispy kreme franchisees in the short term and not be great for those fighting off type 2 diabetes
nobody left hungry and all dishes were attacked with gusto even though some stood up manfully to protect the szechuan reputation for chilli heat
it would have been rude to pry over the total bill but it can be presumed that this is not an inexpensive restaurant
everyone enjoyed themselves and the food was very good service was attentive but did at times get confused but they may have been partially caused by the plethora of different languages and accents on show
after the meal we went onto the terrace area to look out over the river and the everrising skyline of shanghai and the evening drew to a very pleasant close
for the purposes of our visit i would give the south beauty a big positive thumbsup it is well suited to large business groups and isnt phased by large orders hitting the kitchen en masse the service is good and the food better and you leave with that convivial feeling that often comes from a mix of good food and good company, dont bother getting the special room for the extra beautiful view and service there is a large charge for the room with the view one would think that meant special with special treatment nope the food was good spicy but the service was non existent especially for a festive group that wanted to celebratewe could not get them to bring drinks i would not go back too many great dining options in shanghai to pay a lot of money to be ignored, we were invited to this restaurant by a very close family friend it was great szechuan food i wouldnt remember any of the dishes that was ordered even if i had a gun pointed to my head all i know is that my wife and i had a sumptuous meal here and if we had a chance we would return for sure
to top it off the night view of pudong and the bund in lights was just awesome

highly recommended, i dined at south beauty a few years ago and was taken there by my manager who used to live in shanghai he was raving that it is a great szechuan food i found it was good though not great

i went there again last night with 10 work colleagues some of whom are natives of shanghai who did the ordering we had a great variety of food all of which was quite nice but again not great the setting provides a good view over the bund service was quite good overall it was a good choice and best of all i didnt need to pay the bill definitely worth a go if you are spending any length of time in shanghai, like all other restaurants in this chain the food is well prepared and tasty however service in this one was puzzlingly bad and spotty only one waiter spike some english in a mall loaded with visitors and tourists the food came all at once just dumped on us without the rice we ordered or basic tableware like napkins or silverware all around not bad as the booth we were in was totally comfortable and perfect for people watching, this is a chain and the food is of good standard dont expect authentic szechuan kitchen its more standard chinese food with a szechuan tilt and spice level toned way down we liked the food it was well presented and having a table at the window we enjoyed a gorgeous view on the river, located in the super brand mal in shanghais lujiazui area this restaurant has a nice view food was so so but is a safe bet if you want to bring some foreign guests to try spicy szechuan food they can tone down the spice to be more foreigner friendly, a chain restaurant should have steered me away but it came highly recommended the restaurant was in an old house and the ambience was interesting we sat in a corridor converted into a dining area the food was certainly catered to an expat crowd with shanghainese and szechuan cuisine presented as small bites not a great representation of authentic food you will do better elsewhere definitely a tourist trap, i used to really love this restaurant and thought it was one of the best in shanghai if you like spicy szechuan food however it seems to have gone very down hill in the last year or so in a visit this month the food was nowhere near as good as it once was and the prices seem higher the service is also very poor there are lots of much better and better value options if you want good szechuan food eg pinchuan on 47 taojiang rd, this was a nice little place when we finally made it there but on the 10th floor of a mall that only has 8 floors and an escalator that only goes to the 9th floor i expected this place to be awesome it was good but a far cry from awesome

i went with a friend because a traditional chinese meal by yourself just doesnt give the opportunity to really sample the food we ordered quite a few dishes and they were all really tasty

but the atmosphere of this place was to say the least less than desirable you would think after finding a restaurant surrounded in so much mystery that you could have a nice quiet meal and great conversation with a friend but alas the table next to ours was less than 2 feet away barely enough room to walk between them much less have a quiet and private conversation

i will say that the restaurant was well decorated nice table linens and seat covers but maybe i value personal space a bit too much, for those who are not familiar with spicy food south beauty will be a real treat sichuan cuisine is indeed spicy but is also very delicate the guys there know how to accommodate ancestral tradition with modern tastes the terrace is also a big bonus highly recommended although its a tat pricey, i got lost trying to find the top floor of the super brand mall but once i finally found it it was worth the trek the food is great and the views from the rooftop dining area are incredible, great views over the river and bund if you get a window table they have good group tables typical chinese circular style right by the windows helpful service though a little pushy to get you to spend more but not outrageously pushy and good though not great food a solid place for a special group dinner

by the way you will find it at the very top they have their own staircase of the superbrand shopping mall, elegant setting butterflies on the walls great service food was ok we were told this particular restaurant in the south beauty chain was among the top 10 in china so it was with great expectations that we examined the beautifullyphotographed dishes on the extensive menu the dishes are helpfully marked with one to three chili peppers indicating how hot they are

tableside service mixing soysoup and a sort of shabushabu was fun to watch the sichuan dishes were really really spicy service was perfect  neither fast nor slow overall the food was not as spectacularly wonderful as we had been led to expect id rank it above average and a bit on what we call the shanghaigreasy side

would we return yes it was good enough to give this restaurant another try when we are in shanghai, had a taste in april and when i returned in june i just had to have it again also amazing is the spicy fish some renovation works were taking place making it look like a storm just went by but the ambient in the dining area is still cosy, ive been to a lot of the south beauty places to eat over the years in shanghai for business lunches and there are big differences among them the larger restaurants have ok service but the smaller locations have a problem with delayed food and lack of training the food is ok depending on what you order i am very disappointed as this was a good restaurant a few years ago, i have eaten in quite a few places in shanghai and really enjoy the quality and variety of the food here at south beauty the view towards the bund is great too so get a table at the edge of the dining room by the terrace the decor is a bit dated though very 1980s kitsch, if you enjoy szechuan cuisine this is a must while in shanghai selection of different beers on the menu usually only result in one of two beers available but the food there is divine
make sure to grab a table by the windows overlooking the river as the view is outstanding no matter what time of the year you visit
my fav restaurant in shanghai, we had a variety of food all was beautifully presented and very good however we did have to send one plate back to be prepared again because it was too spicy hot large groups were gathered at this restaurant and it seemed very popular, we made a reservation through our hotel and when we arrived at the restaurant they were unable to find the reservation we quickly realised that if you do not speak mandarin it would be difficult to to order food and to communicate with the staff we ordered some white wine and tried to tell the waiter that we wanted the wine to be placed in a ice bucket no way the waiter finally called an english speaking colleague and finally he understood what we wanted we also asked him to make certain that as we were allergic to garlic the food we ordered would be served without garlic all the 3 dishes they served were with plenty of garlic the girl who served us just disappeared and it was impossible to get anybody to explain our problems we finally settled the bill without having touched the food unpleasant and bad service, i was shopping at super brand mall and thought id check it out i was ok with getting a pricey drink or something small to eat since i thought the view would be worthwhile the place was completely empty since it was 330pm on a monday and even then they would not let me sit by a window unless i consumed a 300rmb minimum ridiculous

i took a seat without a view but it was the equivalent of being in the basement with no sunlight shining through with hideous red leather chairs to top it off once i glanced at the menu and noticed they dont even offer wine by the glass i decided south beauty is overrated and i left

disappointing service ambiance menu and outdated tacky decor, we have been to south beauty several times in different locations around the city we go occasionally with chinese friends and they think it is ok too it is by no means high end eating but it is good and reasonably priced","dumpling restaurant",0.78404903403254
184,"all bar constellation offers a great selection of reasonable priced whisky particularly the sweet johnny walker platinum at 100 rmb a glass also great drinks moscow mule old fashions, if you are looking for a proper cocktail this is the place bartenders are very knowledgeable and there is a great selection of whiskey and bourbon small but great atmosphere, this franchise has several spots in shanghai my favorite is constellation two because of the size of the venue consistent selection the service ive received was meh  some times good some times bad some bartenders better than others i didnt order cocktails good yamazaki selection  cherry cask30 year old etc good for business chats id bring my own cigar, this japanesestyle cocktail lounge is perfect for a quiet date but can also get rowdy with friends their service is the best in the city and they can whip up some incredible drinks be patient the drinks each take a few mins to make, great place if you are into whisky and cigar one of the best ever tried huge selection of whisky friendly and knowledgable staff good music, been to this bar a couple of times its a very nice little whisky bar great drinks the bloody mary is to die for

the only complaint is the smoke in this establishment since its a small bar the smoke gets trapped inside it gets really smoky throughout the evening and im a smoker

seating limited so some nights we had to be turned away, went to constellation for postdinner cocktails found from trip advisor only to end up drinking none being a whisky enthusiast ive never seen a more extensive whisky menu anywhere the elegantly designed menu was seperated into not only the main whisky regions of scotland but also included the small islands and lessknown regions explanations and back story for every whisky they had was a particularly smart touch music was nice and smooth the ambiance was quaint and inviting enjoyed every second and did not want to leave a must see for anyone who enjoys good whisky and wants to try new ones, i came across constellation bar by chance during a nightly stroll through shanghai with my gf being a big fan of speakeasy bars we were drawn into the bar and sat down at the bar the whisky selection is incredibly and the cocktails are prepared with skill and class old fashioned and sazerac both went down well the cigar collection is impressive too some of the staff were a bit frosty and wannabe mobsterlike unnecessary in my opinion so i am deducting one point apart from that class bar, very nice tiny bar good for relaxing with friends and have a excellent cocktails
atmosphere is a bit dark but very nice
you can talk and meet new people
only smog smell is a bit too much, ive been to constellation several times and love its ambience ive taken many a friend there over my two years in shanghai with few problems the place is lowlit features a long bar and comfortable leather couches the clientele is talkative and attractive the drinks if exorbitantly priced are tasty at midnight although many of them are too sugary

on my last visit to constellation however one of our party entered the bar extremely drunk this was unfortunate because he is somewhat of a mean drunk he verbally insulted one of the bartenders in chinese a big nono apparently because five of them and the bar manager ganged up on him punching and slapping him in his face in front of all of the bars patrons while our friend undoubtedly deserved a beating for his rudeness was it appropriate for such a classy establishment to stoop so low as to give him that beating the answer undoubtedly is no, went after a big dinner was entertained by the team with some very professional cocktail making it really is an art watching the total care they put into every drink even how they prepare the ice we ordered little blue rain coats pain in the back for the poor barman but worth it with flames everywhere great whiskey sour and very impressive dark and stormy we were lucky that the owner was there and looked after us special treat for us aussie please remember that they smoke indoors in shanghai
nice way to end the night, with all the nightlife and particularly cocktail bars in shanghai this doesnt rate among the more compelling options, new branch on nanjing xi lu tucked away at shanghai centre a perfect hideaway for a whisky or a cocktail staff so friendly a class act, a friend brought me to this cozy and intimate bar and i fell in love with it it feels like the good old days a bar where you can go enjoy a great drink and a good conversation a bit of a time warp great cocktails and a great beverage selection in general service very spot on too it is like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of shanghai, i really like this bar and the highlight for me was the large ball of ice they use for the whisky it works so well

great selection of whisky and drinks and if you like cigars they have a great selection
upstairs is really nice and several private rooms are available


good bar, being a big fan of japanese whiskey namely currently the hakushu 12yrs i visited this well known whiskey bar with a couple of work friends on my last business trip to shanghai the place is very small and gets crowded and many of the tables were shared leaving us quite cramped on the one of few sofas the selection of whiskey is vast but there was only one page in the menu i was looking for and that was the japanese whiskey page japanese whiskey bars are renowned for offering punters impeccable high service but sadly this place failed in that department and we were left making our own drinks after ordering 2 bottles of whiskey half the fun of going to these places is to watch the skilled bar tenders pay great attention to detail when preparing your drinks visit this place if you are looking for a great selection of whiskys cocktails but be prepared not to be dazzled by the service level, from the moment we walked in we were transported to a different time and place extensive collection of the best whiskeys money and taste can buy served by the perfect bartenders you would always wish for wherever you drink not only whiskeys were sampled but a classic absinthe tasting was had as well

located in the old french quarter where the mixture of old and new is always present constellation bar is one place any aficionado should go, first of all this is a bar and not a restaurant fantastic bar with an excellent choice of single malt whiskys and all other kind of spirits if you are a single malt lover ask for the special whisky menu nice cocktails too by the way so when in shanghai you should visit this bar for sure, i was staying in a little hotel near nanjing road and discovered this bar on my way to a day of shopping later i stopped by with my family for a drink the bartenders took time to hand make the whiskey drinks they were the best ive ever had ive never seen that many kinds and brands of whiskey before huge selection with knowledgeable bartenders to help you pick your poison thank you for such a wonderful experience, a definite must when in shanghai great selection of cigars courteous professional bartenders and an excellent selection of whiskys if youre a cigar smoker bar constellation will be one of your stops when in shanghai, i visited the constellation while visiting my daughterinlaws family in shanghai it was right down the street from my hotel near peoples square the bartenders take absolute pride in mixing the best drinks ever with their wide selection of premium whiskeys from all over the world i watched my bartender drip the whiskey onto a sugar cube muddle it muddle an orange rind and continue mixing the drink with care til he delivered the most perfect old fashioned ever a must visit when in shanghai thanks to you for a perfect experience, one of the best bars i ve visited
professional bartenders great variety of very good whiskey
do not go to shanghai without visiting this bar, i have been several times to constellation and never have been disappointed 

i am not a whiskey expert and it is easy to get lost in the wide selection that they propose 

it is like a trip an adventure that you do on 

the staff is full of knowledge and if you arent sure what to choose they will listen to what you want and propose a selection that you may smell before actually getting your glass 

the time before we just had cocktails and they really know their stuff  especially when you know the bar scene in shanghai you really appreciate people who know how to make good ones 

the atmosphere is very cosy tranquille since the people who attend this place know exactly why they are going there for  drinks at their best 

i do recommend this place if you want to have a drink on your own or in a small group and if you want to experience what the world of whiskey really is  you wont leave without willing to know more  , this is a very nice excellent isley bar tucked away in french concession the bartender do make great cocktails old fashioned and of dry martinis nothing to complain about using good polish vodka, i love this place for a drink and a nice atmosphere the selaction of cockteils is amazing the they are professionally prepared the atmosphere is elegant and very comfortable if you are looking for a night of relax and good sipping, probably one of the best whiskey bars in town with a range of single malts that might be hard to find in a whiskey guide book tucked away in the quiet section of the french quarter it has a long counter and sofas parallel to it  a little short on space perhaps but definite
but not on atmosphere, this is the original bar of the three constellations in shanghai located right around the corner and down xinle road this tiny bar is away from the madness around cantina agave and club 88 bartenders are meticulous and make all the classics well be sure to try the moscow mule however remember that most of shanghais bars permit smoking including cigars and constellation is small so it can get quite smoky and crowded on a friday night great for a drink during a walk around the fumin lu area","Mexican cuisine",0.617457446514985

��, i have been a frequent visitor to the ruths chris chain in the usa in years past and it was always an enjoyable dining experience i visited the shanghai ruths chris in february 2014 not long after it had opened and it was okay but with the passage of time service and the food has improved it is not cheap
��, after eating the local food for a few days it is great to have a good steak that gives your plate another taste i have been at ruths chris in new york and hong kong and am glad i found one in shanghai, started with a couple of martinis that were prepared well but it was a small portion which is standard in china but i dont expect a chinese standard while spending this kind of money yes this is a very expensive restaurant the beef while very good is from australia and is just not as good  same as us beef
��, food was very good big portion in traditional us style appetizers are tasty and steak was great service was quite average but the manager went out his way to satisfy his guest will come back, we very much enjoyed the food very good quality and taste the view was also very nice overlooking the river the food and wine selection is great we will come back, absolutely a wonderful experience a little expensive but for those missing the comfort food from home with perfect seasoning it delivers the staff is attentive overall service is great thank you ruths chris, the restaurant open less than a year bring in tw chef and waiters the restaurant do not seem there are a lot of foreign customers the waitress tried to give a lot of attention but she is still not well trained enough esp handling of wine and food introduction the petite fillet i ordered look like put on the too

great for families
eat here several times during my visit to shanghai, after being away from home for almost 2 weeks it was very nice to get a burger and beer just like i would get back home i had a burger and fries which was as good as any i would get in the states maybe better than some after drinking nothing but budweiser and tsingtao having a really good ipa was refreshing and a great end to my visit to china the north star ipa has a nice malt and bitterness balance and wonderful hop aroma the brewmaster special was a pumpkin ale that had a slight pumpkin flavor and the pumpkin spice wasnt over powering if you are looking for a break from the local brews this is the pace to go, walked to lowai st during a business trip and ended up at shanghai brewery for dinner the beer was decent and the establishment is foreigner friendly they also accept american credit cards, met some us colleagues here for dinner the beer here is good they have some local drafts available and a good selection of bottled beers the food was pretty good had a burger and chicken wings that was good american type food will come back, fantastic bar  great range of drinks and food  something to suit every taste quite a large bar so plenty of seating options from couples to families you can situate yourself closer to the bar if you are about drinking and snacks or other table options if you are there for a meal, it all kicked off well but the problem came when i forgot my pack of cigarettes when i left i returned 3 minutes later and first they told me that they didnt see it but after i insisted they dug it out of a trash can and had no shame to give it back to me when it looked like on a photo when i made a remark about the fact that they should keep customers forgotten objects a manager came to me talking in a very aggressive tone that i should be responsible for my personal belongings and this is china so they blame their lack of sense of service onto their own culture nowhere else i saw such an indemnisable service as at this restaurant being called crazy by this so called manager who cant solve a small customer issue i wonder what hes paid for i will never put my foot there again, this is a regular hangout for our china team after there regular meetings good variety of beer good american pub food good value and most importantly good atmosphere and efficient service im sure there will be a few more visit when im in shanghai, the sausages with kraut were good and the house brewed ipa the best i�ve had in china service is friendly in this foreigner oriented bar so you will be welcome they take foreign credit cards which is not always true even on the �foreigner�s street� good place to relax or meet friends, went here new years eve  have to say a great place 2 floors upstairs nonsmoking which is a bonus free pool  darts too the beer prices are good the staff friendly the place was very busy with mostly chinese  very few other westerners

saw in the new year  will return to try food next time too good vibe give it a try

, wanted to watch man utd game new years eve so this was our place to be non smoking upstairs thank god had darts and pool table free upstairs too couldnt of asked for a better place to see the new year in fab night drinks not a rip off staff super friendly cant fault it we will be back for sure, spent friday evening happy hour here and had a great time walked in and it was empty by 7 it was full lots of fun people cute waitress big screen sport ok long islands that arent on the happy hour menu tasty fish and chips ill be back, we went with a small group 5 people total and sat outside good burgers + sliders fajitas sandwiches beer and nachos the kids meals are reasonably priced unlike many other restaurants nearby overall it was a nice atmosphere we went earlier in the evening so dealing with smoking wasnt an issue its also a good place to people watch since its in the middle of a walking street, been here a few times the food isnt cheap but its really generously portioned its authentically foreign unlike some places not all of the staff are excellent though many are but none of them are useless either cassie looked after us today and she was great, food was good it was not a very good place but good one table was bad service was good there was television with sports chanel screened on the whole it was good, not a lot of choices of beer for a brewery decent choice though service is great and atmosphere is excellent you want a place to drink without high expectations of lot of choices  you are in right place sit outside if you are here to enjoy the walk by crowd, the homemade beer is really great food is average quality and service can be good or bad depending on the waiters and the time i liked the fish and chips, we wanted to go to a brewery for fun while we were in shanghai for the weekend the shanghai brewery and boxing cat were the two we found we enjoyed our night at the boxing cat the shanghai brewery was terrible

it was busy so you can tell there are very few brewery options in town it was extremely hot in both floors of the restaurant we had to ask three times for somebody to take our order when we did finally place an order my beer came out 10 minutes after my friends when we asked where my beer was we were told that mine takes a while to make hah made to order beer you have to love it

that is how the evening went all the servers hanging out at the bar and not actually waiting the tables this place truly sucked it is unfortunate there are not more breweries to help put this one out of business i attached a photo of all the servers standing at the bar talking to each other that is what they did all night our two servers were john and jessica

if you want a beer just skip this place and head somewhere else, some staff have been great some  lacking difficult to get anyones attention at times and limited communication at times
food always looks good pricey but to be expected  expect all western prices around the area
been here a few times for drinks have only eaten the natchos which were good but im not a fan of eating around smokers food does looksmell good tho perhaps better around lunch or outside
no non smoking areas can get a bit much has outdoor seating which is nice if the weathers good gets very busy tho
its nice good for the sports and a beer if your feeling homesick or weathers good and prepared to not worry about the bill, i grabbed a seat at the bar for a quick drink and pretty much got treated like i was invisible there were dish washers behind the bar but no sign of a barkeep i finally got a waiters attention and ordered a drink but that was it not nuts no nothing till i flagged them down again for my check it was quite here too so not much of a spot if you ask me as with most places in china the bourbon choices are slim, i have been in shanghai on business for about a week and a half and have come to shanghai brewery 3 times it is a perfect comfort food spot absolutely love their hummus appetizer i get it as my meal highly recommend and will be back, a great place to enjoy a great beer thats a nice place to watch sports they have many tv screen with different channel so that there is sport for every taste
the food is also very good
the terrace is always full when the weather allow which is a good sign of good quality recommended in laowai jie, not only cigarette but also cigar today was so bad we had to leave we have been there several time and love the food because it feels like homeless the cigar, this is a standard western style sports bar which offers a nice atmosphere and lots of sports on tv in the middle of a trip filled with local cuisine this can bring a touch of home for westerners and provide a reminder of the vulgarities of a big pile of french fries and a juicy burger
the restaurant is on the hongmei street with a large selction of restaurants from around the world, great beer atmosphere not healthy food and lots of fun highly recommended for all looking for a bit of home in shanghai while drinking fantastic all kinds of self brewed beer, great place if you want to feel a bit more at home  familiar food  european style beer its a micro brewery and the black eye bear stout is excellent  and strong  plenty of people around you can watch multiple sports on multiple screens play pool and eat excellent western style food it even shows rugby matches from europe and i spent several happy evenings watching rugby world cup matches, good selection of beersciders and the food is served in large portions to soak up the alcohol the german sausages are good and served with mash and sauerkraut, ive been to shanghai brewery several times in the past 6 months on business first visit was based on good ta reviews and walking distance from my hotel pleasently surprised by the quality of beer and food actually one of the better burgers big kahuna ive had and ive had my fair share over the years wings and fries also top notch beers especially the ipa are solid
service like at a lot of places in shanghai is a bit spotty but nothing to get hung up on also can be smoky due to a poorly separated sections
but if youre looking for a good burger and beer while in shanghai this is your spot, i always find this chain of barrestaurant interesting this particular location is in the middle of foreigners street and they just serve very good beers and interesting food once i had a breakfast pizza for the first time not bad at all, went into the pub on a saturday afternoon  to escape the 35c humid weather ended up watching a brilliant richmond  fremantle afl game good beer  ipa and wheat beer in particular good selection of pub food happy hour starts at 3 pm, pleasant and unforgettable experience in shanghai
it is not so far away from peoples square taxi takes about 20 minutes when you arrive to the honmei road you will find many good pubs and restaurants offering different food i really liked the area shanghai brewery offers you a nice variety of excellent beers ipa dark lager and all north star ipa is really recommended if you are a beerdrinker and enjoy a good beer the interior is very nice as a good pub should be sport fantasts can enjoy that while they have their beer the food is also good i have to point out that this is a pub and i compare to goodquality pubfood burgers are very nice personal are very friendly and manage english good enough to do the job the highlight of this place is the beer and the beer this was my second time there and i know that each time i come to shanghai i will be gladly paying a visit to this place to have a few excellent beers and a burger
i highly recommend this place and give them excellent, my traveling companion and i visited shanghai brewing on a saturday the menu was pub food in general i had the fish and chips and was good flakey fish my companion had the sliders and really liked them the atmosphere was nice and comfortable lots of tvs in the establishment but the all were playing rugby the homage brews were good i drank the cider and it was good one of the better places in the area, very good homemade beer
many tv screen displaying sports
food menu quite standard with burger pizza finger food
very good place to spends couple of hours drinking beer with friends, great place to enjoy fantastic beers as well to watch sports events and have simple quick food food quality is ok as well as prices, the shanghai brewery offers several locations but the hongmei location has the most tourist feel to it with plenty of people watching and and excellent selection of in house micro brews that are excellent for any pallet the food was european but plenty of selections to fill you up service was a little questionable but the owner is more than willing to stop and help the staff great plus for the status of the business, i always craving for their pasta i usually come on lunch time coz they have set menu lunch is only rmb 78 you gonna get drink soup main course and fruits i keep coming back to this resto coz of their pasta the concept of the resto is sporty bar and resto staffs are helpful even the western manager i think he willing to clear up our table, if you are a beer aficionado maybe this place is also interesting for you not only for me
the food is just normal but they offer a selection of special beersalmost hand made in a microbrewery with special flavours
for me it was really nice to have a test but i think to prefer more bitter kinds of beer, home pub brewery are not famous for the good food and this place makes no exceptions
i love fish and chips and here they make it by using real cod but thats all
different story for the beers
to me here i can find the best pilsner in town crisp and hopsy
the other ones are well worthy too
in a sunny day there is the possibility to seat outside which for me it is always a plus in winter and mid seasons
positive, this is one of the best places to eat in the western part of shanghai located in lao wei jie  opposite of hongqiao pearl city this is a cluster of restaurants of all tastes
try the beer samplerinside a bit compressed outside nice at the right weather, plenty of choice in the hong mei lu pedestrian street aka lau wai jie or foreigner street but selected the brewery again because of its atmosphere and good beers and something to snack short visit it was staff this time not too friendly, from local cuisine

enjoyed build your own burgers with some colleagues as well as local micro brew at this brewpub chain food was bar food though wings were quite good

service was absent but this is par for the course in shanghai

know youre getting bar food and youll be fine here

lots of tvs for watching the game, been here a couple of times in the evening for drinks and at lunch to eat
the beer is house crafted and very good love the ipa one of the main reasons i keep coming back
go here for lunch as they have a good special that gets you a soup main and a drink for a good price
the evenings have a good crowd mainly expats as this is on the expat street
the manager is a friendly guy always good for a chat, nice atmosphere nice beer really nice nachos  service was good price ok for shanghai definitely a place i will go back to, we went for drinks at happy hour and the place was absolutely packed the manager was nice and helpful about getting us a table for our 6person group

the dark beer was delicious and the mojitos were the best ive ever had absolutely astounding chili cheese fries the only thing we ate there were quite good though they could have used more cheese, i tried the german style beers which were great and had a meal for which there was plenty and for western style food excellent would go again, i tried the dark ale and the wheat beer and found both to be very tasty  excellent beers unfortunately the tasting platter they offer is not available on weekends otherwise i would have ordered that
the food is pub standard but good to excellent in quality i had the calamari served in chunks with aioli sauce  delicious for starters and afterwards pizza excellent especially thin crust the staff was very good attentive and quick it seems that they have a dj on weekends and i enjoyed the classic rock songs he played during dinner time very much all in all a very nice experience, we often go here together with family and friends for a quick bite to eat or to hang out and enjoy a longer stay good food and environment we have taken our dog with us and sat outside when the weather is nice, confortable international music excellet kinds of meals  beers good price quality and service there you can drink your beer watch your favorite team and listen an excellent music nice to happy hours, nice microbrewery  good testing menu good service and always lots of customers try it out, so i love ipas and this is the only place in shanghai were you get one so i went the place is pretty big noisy and full the customers are 34 westerners and a quarter chinese the chinese engage in their national sport smoking and thus the place has that 1990s smell about it depending on your degree of smoke tolerance you will find this annoying or unacceptable

i got a place at the bar and ordered my ipa tastes good but gives you a headache which is the sign of a beer that is brewed in a hurry and from a kit it was friday so i ordered fish  chips was okay no complaints really i also had nice company

re the service in china it is sketchy because people are not trained as they are in the states or elsewhere so the chinese in that place are funny but there was a british chap behind the bar who was super friendly

so why only three points well the smoke and the headache i am a softie, choices the pedestrian mall is full of choices and the decision to stop by here instead of the usual city bull was driven by the prospect of fresh crafted beer i particularly enjoyed sitting outside while enjoying my beer and finger food this place would be hard to beat on a summer night and yes i plan on returning to fully appreciate the experience if you enjoy beer  say no more and try it out ","Healthy",0.999848758002451

they provide you with a heavy jacket you will be thankful for then its up to you a vodka many choices and prices in a sub zero environment, we booked the all around kafer package with friends start in the lounge with some appetizers than icebar with vodka and salmon bavarian with with sausage brezels and beer and finally a privat room with european style cousin very nice experience and will do again, fine traditional german fare with a chinese touch crisp service and good wine and beer selection the view is worth the price of lunch or dinner alone, been here a few times now and am becoming somewhat of a regular so thought it was time to repay the restaurant with an appreciative review

this is one of the best value brunches in shanghai and the views arent too shabby too with its riverside location despite not having the benefit of a birds eye location like the hyatt the buffet and drinks and really where kafer excels waiters diligently top up your glass with excellent prosecco for the duration of your visit and the buffet has an excellent range of cold meats and cheeses hot dishes steak seafood and steaks the german sausage with sauerkraut and slices of mango cake are particular highlights there are also dishes you can order from the menu such as risottos eggs benedict fish and steaks in addition to the free fizz nice red and white wines teas coffees and soft drinks are all included in the reasonably priced 390 rmb one or two of the dishes on the menu were better than others and i would also hugely like to see oysters being offered even if this is limited to one or two per customer but for the price its hard to complain the ice vodka bar is also worth a brief visit if youre still feeling thirsty after the brunch and the warm coats provided make this a touch more bearable

to be objective the food is slightly better quality at the likes of the hyatt brunch but certainly not by a large enough margin to justify paying the double price i also prefer the more laid back atmosphere here which has made it a hit unsurprisingly with the local german expat community it would be nice to see a bit more variation in the menu and buffet as a repeat customer as i have eaten a lot of those sausages now but i will still probably return once more, i frequented this restaurant when i was working in shanghai we celebrated many occasions

the service and attention to details is unparalleled whenever we miss certain comfort food the chef would try their best to make us happy this makes up for the limited food menu i must say that their wine is extensive and very reasonably priced for such a restaurant in shanghai there is a sunday brunch which is perpetually fully booked if you do not reserve in advance

the view is stunning when we have a clear day be it day or night

i would rate this place as a 6 star restaurant, been here many times when in shanghai ill be there again next month theres too many good things to say food is fabulous  brunch lunch and dinner is great everything is good about the place the staff is wonderful and goes the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction the added benefit is the ice vodka bar expats will not be disappointed a must go to spot, this place was excellent i attended a bbq in the garden on a beautiful summer day and the food was was excellent the atmosphere also great and staff so helpful and kind  i really recommend this place for a visit, their sunday brunch is a semibuffet soups appetizers desserts while egg dish and main course a la minute the package includes freeflowing prosecco this is what we came here for service is excellent  very attentive the assistant manager visited our table quite a few times making sure that everything is fine overall experience is great they even have an ice bar with vodkas of any kind, two friends and i were walking around the city and decided to stop here for lunch food and view were both terrific service was excellent too the staff helped us get a cab back to our hotel after our meal i would highly recommend if you are looking for a fairly upscale restaurant with a beautiful view away from the hustle and bustle, called by to experience the kaefer snow bar its a copy of the original ice bar idea basically theyve built a large walkin fridge which has been decked out in translucent plastic ice to which a few shovel fulls of crushed ice have been added and a couple of dozen different bottles of vodka have been arranged around the bar the temperature is kept at 5c and guests are offered the use of free north face parkas for the duration
its a bit of fun for up to 10 minutes before the novelty wears off and the cold kicks in
the main kaefer bar and dining area is a tastefully done copy of an alpine lodge and seems like a pleasant place although it was very very quiet during the hour or so of early evening that we were there the drinks werent cheap as there appeared to be no happy hour discounts cant comment on the food as we decided to eat elsewhere, food and service are on higher level and is very cosy there nice view good location perfect service and amazing food i wrote my comment for the sunday`s brunch i can recommend without restrictoins normal price for brunch is 398rmb for all you can eat and all you can drink i gues for that quality is cheap , visited three times for business and with friends the view of the river combined with impeccable food service and smiles is calling back for more rib steak with bone great salads great drinks dont forget to visit the sub zero room on the ground floor serving super chilled vodkas from around the world make sure you wear the provided heavy coat  overall just a fun experience every time thank you , i was second time to brunch and it was amazing again service buffet location absolutely brilliant it is an all you can eat and drink for 400 yuan for the quality and quantity what i got the price is cheap we wwas ther from 11am  15pm i can reccomend this without any restrictions just go and enjoy, we needed some european food as an alternation from the chinese cuisine and were surprised to have a wiener schnitzel which was so tasteful  hard to find in europe
the owner presented himself to us and showed us around in the entire restaurant which is modern but warmly decorated to make you feel like in an austrian mountain chalet and there is also a cool ice bar which serves over 200 vodka types, rather like the m on the bund this is more european fare a short walk from our shangri la hotel next to the river, this is by far one of the most beautiful restaurants in shanghai pure elegance with matching attentive and efficient service staff the food is also very good and very impressive having said all that it does not come cheap but it is one of those pricey dinners that makes you feel its worth it i have been here several times for dinners and for lunches and i must say that the luck sets are a must, had a family dinner here and we re not satisfied by the quality of food and service overpriced food or limited set menu options wouldnt be able to manage ordering a simple 3 courses properly wine price are took much beyonding the benchmark in shanghai for such a location service begins well finishes badly only one staff smiled to us when arrived then the attention of services was very poor
go there once as th view is from an unique angle but dont go further if you are looking at valuable dinner, excellent view and attentive service compliment the several tasting menus and a small a la carte selection of note no green salads were offered and the prefixe menus 4 with increasing costs from about 450 y to 888y  are limited without options within each set menu the restaurant features european style foods with an eye to the asian palate food sourced with iberian pork australian beef american lobster and foie gras pork schnitzel is offered a la carte but that appeared to be the only german entree the wine list is on the high end and there is a full bar outdoor dining is available in good weather if well prepared beautifully presented foods served by attentive staff in a bundriver view pudong location is what youre seeking kaefer wont disappoint be prepared to spend min 600yuan per person, we been to kafer a couple of times now and it has never disappointed us so far we had a family brunch one sunday in february and were placed at a window table with a nice view of the bund across the river service was extremely attentive the appetizer food selection  all from the buffet  is excellent with a wide range of cold cuts salads and other well prepared dishes the main courses are served and one can opt to start with a typical egg style brunch dish before selecting a main course we skipped the egg dish and only took the main course which was again excellent desserts are from the buffet before coffeetea are served the brunch is inclusive of an excellent sparklingredwhite wine andor juices and the ambiance in the restaurant great with many expatriates making this their regular sunday hangout, this was one of the best dinners weve had in shanghai so far they had a prefixe menu for chinese new year but we opted to order from the regular menu everything we had was cooked to perfection

the ambience was inviting elegant and comfortable the service was impeccable

after dinner we went for a few vodka shots at the snow bar which is just downstairs from the restaurant

we will be back, normally when one thinks of a german restaurant schnitzel pretzels and bratwurst come to mind but kafer stands out from your average german restaurant in so many ways

not only are the options numerous varied and delicious but it is also split into various atmospheres the upstairs area is the nicest with stunning views of the bund and excellent service with an elegant atmosphere the bar area downstairs is a bit shabby but the swiss cottagegerman villagestyle downstairs restaurant area near the ice bar is quite sweet if a bit surprising upon first encounter

the food is creative and tasty the prices not cheap but still reasonable and well worth the price especially if you sit upstairs

the service is nice and friendly the food and atmosphere excellent will be back again with more friends still waiting for the right chance to use their cute wine cellar private dining room , great view of the river traffic comfortable setting good food nice selections of soup had the pan fried pork filet cooked perfectly and seasoned well would recommend as a good change from family style local cuisine, been there for the sunday brunch the the atmosphere and decor are great and the food was superb great quality and taste the service were excellent the staffs were very friendly
definitely will be back again, western style restaurants can be a bit fickle in shanghai and even though you have to pay often top dollar in many cases there is often a little something which leaves you slightly disappointed in case of kafer where my wife and i had a spontaneous lunch this was not the case location food and service was perfect and even though not the cheapest place upmarket western restaurants are never cheap in shanghai though value for money was excellent and we will certainly go again maybe a little tip here even though kafer is slightly off the beaten track this is a good place to take any visitors when walking down the bund on the puxi side taking the ferry across the river and then walking back up to pearl tower or superbrand mall on the way to the pearl tower you will pass kafer on the left side of the road which is a nice place to look at the bund and the river with a different feel to many of the other restaurants located in the taller skyscrapers, bit tricky to find but if you turn left facing river from citi building you cant miss came on a monday was a bit quiet but food was very tasty and not pretentious reasonable choice of wine by the glass and nice views over the river good choice of some classics had schnitzel and some more contemporary food without losing its roots, kafer is one of my favorite restaurants in the city not a big fan of fancy appetizers but the pastas are to truly great compared to some of the other upscale restaurants the atmosphere is relatively laid back and accessible definitely book in advance, the kafer in shanghai is somewhat quieter and more elegant than the original in munchen but more expensive too right now they have a french week with a special menu of french dishes we were sitting on the first floor with a view on the water and had a simple dinner with onion soup coq au vin and apfelstrudel with a bottle of riesling the coq au vin was the best i have ever eaten the service was very attentive and friendly again some of the best i have seen in shanghai it isn�t noisy so you can quietly talk about something over dinner and feel very comfortable the bill was 1368 yuan for a dinner for two but you certainly get what you pay for

a detail worth mentioning the restaurants in binjiang park on the river some of which are very good all have no street number and google maps can show you the wrong direction so to avoid loss of time you better familiarize yourself with the place ahead of time and give your friends precise instructions for kafer  at the end of huayuanshiqiao lu when you hit binjiang park turn left not right as google would have you and you are almost there kafer is on the right, great selection of dishes on offer for buffet brunch starters anf tasty main courses good river view across to the bund and excellent inobtrusive service from the helpful staff, went their with a group of appr 25 people for dinner service was very good the menue we selected was terrific tasty but not too hot i had salmon which was served with spinach jamjam
in addition if you sit on the first floor you ahve a wonderful lokk on the river bund but be aware that you cannot see anything if you sit outside as the hedge is too dense to see anything from the river and the skyline of shanghai
fully recommended, we went to kafer since we had a bogo free sunday brunch coupon in our enjoy shanghai book worth the money as this coupon alone covers the price  some of the book the buffet included 2 soups breads fruit many cold salads cold fish and a carving station the assortment and taste were good the unlimited entrees we ordered were the lobster tail ok veggie lasagna ok and beef tenderloin amazingand easily the best steak ive had in sh over the past year the service was good they mistakingly gave our entrees to another tablewho for some reason didnt bother to tell them they didnt order them but were very apologetic and got them to us quickly after we asked about them it would be a bit pricey if we didnt have the bogo couponbut less than other western buffets in sh, went for a sunday brunch now the deal is with free flow of drinks juices soft drinks redwhite wine an okay prosecco coffee tea unlimited a la carte and buffet appetizers soup and desserts
main courses were not that great veal was way overcook eggs benedict were also poached too long time and came without creamed spinach and on a very unexciting piece of toast bread not toasted another beef dish also failed to excite the black cod was okay though
some of the appetizers were pretty nice some not that great i liked the fish options tomato soup looked and tasted like very watery tomato soup desserts were overall okay cheese cake and creme brulee appreciated
service was overall very good and the drinks were swiftly refilledcoffee came with warm milk and tasted good
view and atmosphere were all very nice even tough its a little off from the main lujiazui area
overall its lower cost than the buffets in the better hotels but not worth for me  i can get nicer a la carte dishes in other places for less money and if i want to splurge there are better other options the quality is not up to the level it need to be and its a real pity as id want to like it, we accidentally bumped in to this place and were a bit hesitant to go in as the place looked very classy and expensive however despite wearing shorts and being sweaty after a long day of sightseeing we were welcomed in a good way  we both chose a set of four dishes and we cant say we were disappointed the food was pretty western so probably not the right place to go if youre looking for the chinese experience the food tasted delicious but as we expected it was kind of expensive except from the food the service was top notch and the view is stunning especially at night toilet facilities were very good and they also had free wifi this place is worth a visit if you dont mind spending some extra money for a nice evening would definitely visit again, if you like the occasional splurge on a 5 star hotels extravagant all you can drink sunday brunch but want a change of scene then kafer the binjiang one is a nice hidden gem of a restaurant located in an european house former hqs of one of the british trading hung along the huangpu river along the bund side next to the ferry terminal kafer provides high quality and good service sunday brunch  398rmbperson this includes all you can drink winesparkling wine a nice buffet and anything you want to order a la carte the buffet is high quality with some nice german fare but also some great seafood for mains you can order some great dishes such as veal sea bass and lamb shank all presented very well if you get a table along the window you can watch the boats go by and on clearer days see the old bund waterfront the staff here is very attentive and we had a european staff serve us the whole time and never had to ask for a refill of wine or take a plate away probably the best service i have seen in shanghai

restaurant is great for visitors as well as expatslocals living here has a very european feel to it

tip if you live in shanghai then it is worth getting enjoy shanghai vip card which has a buy one get one free coupon for this sunday brunch it will pay for itself in this one visit, visiting during restaurant week where a set price and a choice of three dishes for each course proved a steal in the cityalso situated right on the river it is a great spot to watch the bright city lights so good i will not hesitate to return and pay full price a starter of brulleed foie gras was delicious as was lobster and turbot stew when we arrived there was no window seat but as soon as one was vacated we were moved although had never requested this so nice touch only issue was a group of very noisy diners behind us at times we were unable to hear each other speak rude loud diners not the fault of the restaurant but i did think staff may have asked them to keep it down a bit however at the end of the meal we were invited to the ice bar and given a couple of vodka shots to erase the memory of noisy diners i guess again a nice touch staff were excellent when my husband remarked that the apple and potato mash was as delicious as it had sounded and extra bowl was brought to him looking forward to a return visit, would have probably given it a 45 but id rather be generous in this case ive been here for dinner several times and sunday brunch and can report that each time was near perfection i could go on about the staff chef etc all put together it is a wonderful dining experience

if you are considering it please put it on your calendar, sometimes its hard to think you could be surprised in shanghai and then you stumble into the shanghai version of kafer located on the huangpu river just 300m north of the ferry from the bund and across from fraser suites this restaurant has many hints of the excellence of its namesake in munich and some nice shanghai touches as well everything  really everything  is very well done it is not cheap nor is the original in munich but it delivers a lot of value for the money so im=n my opinion well worth it

there are two very nice rooms upstairs for groups who wish to dine in private and there is an ice bar which is a sort of walk in freezer outfitted as a bar so your freezing cold vodka will stay that way as long as you can stand it it is quite a hit in the hot summer months, menu was ok food well prepared by chef and price was reasonable for shanghai location on the river was very nice at night, we usually come here for sunday brunch great food upscale atmosphere attentive and friendly service and a great position on the river this place may just be my favourite restaurant anywhere, was invited by a customer great place had cocktails first on the roof bar quited expensive but lovely

dinner was great we tried all kinds of different dishes our host took care of the menu great food would definately visit again whan back in shanghai, well not the best location to go if u live in puxi
but they got good brunch though all you can eat with sparkling and wine
good german selection if u into that, we choose this venue for a recent dinner with overseas visitors and we are still talking about the evening the food was excellent well thought through different and delicious i shared the duck which comes in 2 servings one traditional with potato dumplings and red cabbage the second serving in a fusion way regardless what it was the simple but delicious oxtail soup or the delightful deserts all dishes have been at the highest quality the wine selection was also perfect and the burgundy served and decanted as it should be thanks to melanie the service was an experience in itself including the visit to the icebar on the way out we are looking forward to our next dinner at kaefers shanghai forget about the socalled high end places that have fancy names famous chefs that probably never have seen the kitchen there and high bills  kaefer is the way to go, kaefer offers fine western dining inspired by german traditions but instead of wurst and schnitzel they offer delicous new interpretations like two variations of ox containing a hearty ox sirloin and an oxtail praline get surprised  it is very good black cod with sweet thick pumkin sauce super fresh king prawns an own interpretation of beef tartare with salmon roe and best of all a gorgeous hot chocolalate cake wit salty nougat ice cream was there with my family we loved each dish the location is also outstanding sirectly at huangpu river with nice views ther service is coordinated by german manager melanie who is extremely comptetent attentive and helpfull to get the dishes yuou likesorry must say claerly my favorite choice for western food in shanghai these days pls take away the passport of the german chief he is doing great","French cuisine",0.999835432755677
188,"had dinner here one night during our stay at sofitel there was a nice selection of both hot and cold foods as well as a nice dessert buffet, we visited the restaurant to have dinner after our long tripwe chose to go there because we tried sofitel restaurants all over the world and the quality remains the sameexcept for this restaurant our orders were of poor qualitytasetless and rediculeously expensiverestaurant staff abilities to speak english were very limited, very nice spread and a definitely a treatthe choices were unlimited in desertsgreat location too, what a relief from chinese food  an elegant well loaded buffet with fresh and tasty dishes had a blast , this was an ok restaurant with horribly slow service and rather unimaginative dishes vegetarian options were quite limited and the price was high for a hotel restaurant in shanghai all in all we were not impressed, i always enjoy to stay in the sofitel hotel by east nanjing road in shanghai  i also like their restaurant which is also a place for my daily breakfasts they have good food and they have very good service i also like the atmosphere of this restaurant i recommend it to everybody romanp, while we stayed in sofitel weve visited this restaurant they were having buffet for dinner recommended the prawns and lamb chops in teppanyaki area a bit expensive, had breakfast lunch  dinner at this restaurant  overall was disappointed particularly with the buffet lunch not good value for money for the quality of food offered, restaurant is good i just wish it had more options in the menu i went there three times and also asked for room service since i was staying at the hotel and all of the times the food was good, didnt like the layout of the tables breakfast items nnot in ordelry manner but good variety service not good as staff dont speak engloish or french fb manager was very professional and offered to help, love the ambience bright and cheery  love the bread basket which are placed on every table the coffee is good served piping hot good selection of fresh juices and breakfast buffet spread service is excellent, the hotel is really good and their service is supreme the restaurant is ok and the food is not bad their service is really good and the view from the restaurant is nice the price is fair and reasonable, i can only speak for breakfast only as i hadnt got other meals there the coffee is good as its not sour hot chinese food as well as cold cuts are avail it has bread pudding as wellyes at breakfast, this was a quiet and modern restauraunt on the 2nd floor of the sofitel hotel
it offers either a la carte or buffet with a choice of western and asian cuisine

subdued lighting gives ambiance to this place and there an numerous tables for two available

we were staying at one of the other major hotels in town but its restaurants were offering more expensive and richer foods than we were seeking on the night we decided that a lighter meal was the way to go so after looking for a while found mosaics we chose a light meal consisting of french onion soup quite good without being extrordinary then a cheese burger with wagyu beef and a baguette  the cheeseburger was satisfactory not overly tasty together with large chips the baguette was a closed roll type which is a bit unusual but it too was tasty enough

nothing to write home bout but if looking for a light meal in the western style this should suit, good restaurant but with small choice and far away from french excellence

good space for tables dining room a little noisy

personnel do not always speak sufficient english, a buffett style restaurant with the best of western and multi nation asia food i chinese japanese and some korean i think but it was all very good they even had an european icecream parlour, wide variety of food good value great deserts a bit of an eclectic assortment nonetheless the quality was good and there was always a familiar dish and something interesting to try, my wife and i were here for dinner as we were staying at the hotel it was a bit late almost 10 pm some of the menus had been sold out and the waitres was not informed so the oder process took longer time my wife had to change the order two times and my order came almost 20 minutes later she apologized for not having enough staffs on duty the food itself was in average, this is in the hyland sofitel hotel on nanjing road one of the streets that is a must visit for shoppers and people who love to eat classy i personally tried their continental food and their carbonara was yum its a lovely dinin experience intoto may not be as big but its a nice cozy joint in the heart of the city that you shouldnt missperfect for friends and family or even for a quick business dinner if you dont mind the loud talks of people near your table, liked the hotel alot as it is in a prime location to nanjing rd and other sights the buffet was not what i expected it was really small and on the expensive side $65audpp the desert was excellent bed was huge but very firm mattress loved the huge bathroom and having a choice between a shower and bath would stay here again , this is a restaurant where you can have different variety and has a different class and taste ambiance is different but nice staff is courteous, i had dinner here and was amazed at the size of the portions the choices on the menu were varied as well as there was a dinner buffet this was not just a restaurant in a hotel but one with a presence of its own margaret the waitress who served me who served me could not have been more helpful i would go back here in a flash if i was in shanghai again both for the food and the ambiance, the breakfasts here are very good dinner is al cart or buffet you get to chose good food cabonara pasta is very nice desert for buffet are also pretty good, had an excellent lunch herevery nice relaxed environment with welcoming and courteous staff food was hot and delicious and presented very well highly recommended, just convenient only cantonese restuarant around the area not big but adequate a decent mean waitresses are nice and helpful, diner buffet is our favourite you can taste ffrench italian as well as chinese and japanese food they regularly have promotions such as foie gras or cheeses desserts are extremely various at least 12 different types and delicious, this is a very nice restaurant where i had two excellent dinners and breakfast the meals are quite expensive but in keeping with the star rating of the hotel service is efficient though rather chilly there is a difficulty in engaging with customers it appears probably due to language and possibly cultural differences i would like to have asked a few questions about the meal i ordered but felt unable to my breakfast was not what i ordered but then i didnt have to pay again language and understanding the menu seemed to be the issue the food was very good somewhat small servings but really nicely made and presented i was quite content to eat there during my stay not being very adventurous about food, im sure that the food is lovely so i should have given it a better score but i ordered a take away coffee to take up to the room they charged me $15aud and it taste so terrible that we didnt even finish it, the food is really fantastic there is a lot of choice the only negative thing about the food is that some platters are too cold also the airco is so high that you really need to wear a cardigan, i had breakfast lunch brunch and dinner at mosaic during my 14day stay at the sofitel  there was a wide variety of food on the buffet and it was ever changing with various focuses such as italian mexican japanese indian and lots of local fresh ingredients fruit  fruit juice salad etc i also ordered off the a la carte menu and a favorite for me was the three or five cheese platters the staff was very attentive especially margaret who made certain our team was always seated and served promptly the fresh baked morning muffins  croissants and bakery breads was a nice addition to each meal desserts especially the chocolate ones were very well done  and appointed on the plate nicely, i was contemplating how to surprise my wife for our anniversary well found out that there is a new french executive chef he had made a fantastic event by cooking classical french meal for us plus our tail consisting of our daughter my wifes sister and our nephew service was just impeccable and my wife declared this the best outing she ever had on our anniversary and this was the 26th so she had a body of work to compare with chef sachas cooking was nothing short of spectacular the most surprising however was wine list i was surprised that nice french wines can be have at sofitel for much less than in other compatible venues i would sincerely recommend to have your special occasion there or just dropby for their great buffet you will not be disappointed, great experience from the entrance until we left we started off with some nice promotional cocktail at the bar 555 margaritta took all the time to explain us the specialities from the kitchen conveniently they had a nice board with all specials so that we could easily remember must try is the beef burger  home made beer
wine was recommended and completed the meal just perfect
topped was the dinner at the end with the fantastic cheese plate give it a try
surprisingly the bill was moderate which made this lovely dinner great value for money, i travel to shanghai on business at least six times a year and have made this my shanghai home away from home the sofitel is located in a perfect location in the midst of the action on nanjing road a short walk from the bund and close to the rail station
the sofitel has a terrific executive floor highly recommend upgrading to that which entitles you to a full breakfast either in the second floor restaurant or on the top floor nightly wine and a terrific place to congregate or have a brief business meeting
the rooms are modern wellappointed and comfortable
the staff has been there for a long time and they still care about you and go out of their way to welcome you upon your return either at the end of a long day or whenever i return to the city after a few months away
the buffet on the second level is excellent and they have two additional restaurants in the hotel each of which is good to excellent
the hotel is modern but not new and there was a rumor floating around that sofitel was going to leave once their management contract expired i was a little concerned but i understand that this wont happen
you can stay at much more expensive hotels in the city now the four seasons etc but for simple convenience coupled with good service and wellappointed rooms and decent food you cannot do better than this place
the hotel is also very close to the 2 line so riding by subway is convenient if floating around shanghai and trying to avoid the horrible city traffic
if i have but one complaint its that youre immediately bombarded by street vendors the second you leave the hotel but thats typical of shanghai not necessarily this hotel its just the way it is
its quiet its clean and its not expensive compared to other properties
all things considered you could do a little better but much much worse, we ate at the sofitell every morning even though we did not stayed there the food is great so tasty many choices and the cakes and pastry i miss it i heard from friends that dinner are great too sorry i didnt have the chance, all is made for you to find what you want to eat  various food various drink breakfast is as you wish  fruit very good yogourt various bread all kind of beverage you can choose different kind of eggs, the atandard rooms in this hotel are like in an old 3 star hotel they are very very old and run down the bathtub is so old and the shower curtain so dirty you really wonder that something like this still exists the beds were very old with a tv from the 90s ans the carpet that has not been shampood for the last 10 years after discussing the situation of this awful 5 star hotel we were upgraded to the club floor without the club floor goodies so stingy after an awful first night where everything was modernized i would never come back here even though breakfast and location are great","bar",0.999665513386198
189,"another return visit to mayita

visiting shanghai on a one day business trip and when a business diner meet was squeezed in schedule before the airport ride i saw the opportunity to return to mayita a slice of latin heaven in shanghai

here they do make the best margaritas i have tasted and i tried a few dont be cheap and opt for their standard ones go straight for their killer margaritas coz you are worth it they are made with the best ingredients and you can taste the difference

oh they got food too and some of the best kind of mexican i have come across their version of mexican food is not the heavy greasy american style but a fresh and slight sophisticated one served well presented also

we decided to sit out side on their terrace to enjoy view of the skyline and ordered plates to share and went for all time favourites like crispy tacos with blackened fish bork belly soft tacos and quesadilla with slow cooked pulled pork all full of flavour and tasting great

as this was a business dinner i didnt want sit and take food selfies however i am sure there are plenty by other users posted here

wir yes a highlight to my shanghai trips, we were staying at frasers residence where this is restaurant is located and spent a few days dining at other local places to avoid your typical high priced hotel restaurants
when we dined at mayita we were very surprised how good it was we were given a table with great views over the shanghai and noted how clean the venue was
the service was great and the food met our expectations, this restaurant was a lovely surprise its not on the bund or in a glamorous location however it has a lovely deck with a great view the food was delicious and were very picky with mexican food the service was excellent i highly recommend it, it is at 6th floor and part of a appartment hotelnive ambience delicious mexican foodgood vegetarian optionreasonable cost and good service
, the food is well prepared but could have used a bit more pop the restaurant itself is quiet and enjoyable the staff was attentive for mexican food outside of north america it was of high quality with nothing else to compare it with in shanghai i might try another mexican option there before returning, this restaurant was recommended to us by a colleague who said they have very good mexican food reasonably priced  and she was right the restaurant is situated on the 6th floor of the fraser residences very nice serviced apartments with pool and gym and gives it quite a luxury feel unfortunately we couldnt sit outside as it was too cold but the inside seating area is so cosy and nicely decorated the staff was very welcoming friendly fast and helped us to choose the right amount of food and variety i would like to return in a group of friends or for a birthday party soon, we stayed at the fraser for 2 weeks and visited the restaurant probably 10 of those days the food is really outstanding
great tasting thick hearty chili fresh ceviche you have to try the pork belly taco its very lean for pork belly mushroom burrito and mushroom quesadilla so tasty the last night i tried the short rib omg outstanding this is also a must try
all that being said about how great the food was i would have to say the staff is what made the difference
veronica and jeff and ilene
amazing people and we really enjoyed our time with them great conversation and great employees they are lucky to have you
if we get the opportunity to go back we will see you all again
wendy and martin, we stayed at the fraser residence for a couple of weeks summer 2016 and ate here several times veronica was a perfect hostess the wait staff and bartenders were all friendly and helpful, i ate in mayita a few times whilst living in the fraser residence the food was excellent and the staff were always helpful the food is written up as mexican and it certainly tastes like it, smaller than maya being inside fraser service apartment same menu and service level go for margaritas and tasty starters and appetisers if room for mains try beef slices and end with churros in chocolate overall enjoyable and reasonable prices, the food was delicious there was a party going on and it was full of life the owner is a great guy and chatted with many people id definately recommend this establishment, keep out
i actually had a nice dinner at this favorite place food and service was really good and i was in mood for giving good tips
however  10 minutes after i left my bank called and informed they blocked my card after someone tried cash 10000 us$
can you believe i was shocked and got no help from either the restaurant nor the hotel where its situated
noone took notice and i was left back to pay rest of my business travel from parivate accounts
so  stay out of here dont go and look after your card  never let it out of sight, my boyfriend and i were staying at the fraser and decided to try this restaurant at the terrace prices are a bit expensive for the portion you get a guy from philippines who was waiting our table was very friendly food tasted good overall view is very nice from the terrace, the food is well cooked and some dishes decently closed to mexican flavors the staff is kind and people always pay attention to customers the terrace is very nice for having lunch or dinning with nice ambient not an excellent restaurant for mexican food but very decent in shanghai, at first i thought maybe just a bit pretentious partly due to the lady that invited me but immediately the service was fast and attentive the menu full of choice
then the food started coming  wow all good dishes we tried 45 different appetizers and they were all sooooo good normally im tough on mexican this is slightly different to the standard fare but i give the food here an a margaritas were good a drink after dark on the deck  not the least romantic place i have ever had a margarita nice ambience to say the least
pricing fair price for really outstanding food, when in rome do as romans and eat italian when in shanghai eat shanghainese eat shanghai food

well not tonight

staying at the fraser residences arriving late and tired i was too exhausted to venture out so i remembered there was a nice latin restaurant with a good terrace within the property

browsed thought the menu stand feeling indecisive but here i was entrapped by a very competent hostess who flashed some stunning illustrative photos of interesting dishes in front of my eyes and the mouth start watering

due to the unstable weather i decided to stay indoor instead of enjoying their nice terrace setting and the hostess explained the menu in details and i must say pictures say a thousand words

not being a huge fan of the heavy mexican kitchen the menu and dishes here are really different and innovative compared to your standard texmex cactus cantina type of outlet

after recommendation i decided on a starter being crispy tacos of with blackened fish  wow heaven in a taco

while i waited for the food to be served mayita served me the best margherita ever cant explain it something with everything agave just do yourself a favour and ask for it

for the main course i also followed the hostess recommendation and opted for a beef salad style dish being beef strips served medium with salad and fruity garnish lovely

to round it up

service  attentive
servings  generous
speed  speedy gonzales move over
price  quality doesnt come cheap but prices are fair
comfort food level  oh yeah
interiors  not bad does the trick
wir  yes tomorrow, great mexican food they have one vegetarian choice in appetizers salad and main course everything we tried tasted great attentive charming staff outdoor area was full but still quiet it seemed we had the place to ourselves overall a great place to spend your evening finding entrance is tricky reach fraser residence and take elevator to 6f, my husband i and our boys 9  11 loved this place at first we against eating mexican food in shanghai but we were craving familiar food so glad we came the restaurant has amazing views and the food was so delicious we ordered the chipssalsaguac a must the boys ordered the chicken tacos and beef tacos and my husband and i split the blackened chicken fajitas absolutely amazing with 2 bottles of water 2 glasses of wine out bill totaled $100 we highly recommend this place and will come back again, it<u+00b4>s a bit hard to find the entrance which is through fraser residence lobby and take the elevator up to the 6th floor there is also an elements fresh restaurant there
been to this place few times now and the food as always been great i can recommend the fajita quesadilla and tacos the salmon was also great but a bit on the heavy side with mash potatoes
they have two for one margaritas for a few hours until 1900 we have only managed to get there before 19 one time there is also a free flow margaritas on saturday and sundays for 165rmb for me it<u+00b4>s sweet enough with two
the staff is friendly and most of them speak fluent english being from philippines or mexico, views really amaizing food was really good and also the service and atmosphere quiet ambient we asked for some tacos and burritos and we can recommend them for sure, i enjoy having this restaurant within the hotel and food is good the outside seating is a bonus and location is amazing when weather is warm can get noisy when there a larger parties dining great cocktails although unclear of happy hour offer, great terrace with outdoor seating  nice city view for a drink with friends actually indoors had lovely views too as for the food i wanted to love it butmeh its not bad but its not great either i preferred the original maya and was surprised that the food was so different from maya the guacamole was bitter the fish taco appetizer had more chilli than flavor i couldnt find the mango in the mango avocado salad i will say that the service was excellent so thats a plus, this place nailed it
with a big terrace with a beautiful view of different sides of the city you can enjoy an authentic mexican taste in shanghai
the menu keeps its essentials since 10 years ago but thats their strength as you want to come back for more
try the mango salsas and the tamarind margarita
also first place to have mezcal in town ganbei, pretty excited about going there the other night since maya is also one of our favorites but we decided to change a bit 

nice location view isnt outstanding but gives a different perspective to shanghais skyline 

drinks ordered quickly served and pretty good  nothing to say 

appetizers came in quickly  tacos combo that were ok but the shrimp cocktail was just a disaster  so much spice in it that the taste was just killed  shame because it is one of our favorites 

and then 

a long but very long wait for our main dish  roughly an hour  wasnt a complicated dish but seems that in the kitchen there might make been some management issues or less cook as usual  because even though one of the waiters told us that there was a lot of people tonight euh  where half of the tables were empty we still werent previously told that it might take some time 

i dont mind waiting i just liked to be informed in advance  not have to beg for information 

so overall maybe a pretty harsh review but at the same time with such price tags you expect a minimum in service , located in the fraser residence shanghai at 98 shouning road mayita offers unique and tasty mexican food in a lovely setting

we started our meal with guacamole and chipotle dips and found both to be excellent followed by the 3 soft taco plate try the pork belly taco  youll be amazed at the flavors and chicken fajitas we left feeling extremely satisfied

wonderful gracious service also offers outdoor seating with a nice view of the pudong highrises  its a little pricey but offers some interesting menu options other than the oftenseen combo plate of tacoenchilada mayita is worth a visit, mayita mexican restaurant is alright my family and i arrived around 730 pm for dinner and opted to sit outside immediately we ordered margaritas which were very refreshing tortillas  guacamole dip for the main dish i suggest the blackened chicken fajitas and for dessert try the coconutalmond flan the flan is actually served in a half coconut shell which me and my 8 yrs old nephew picked ate and enjoyed, based in the fraser residence shouning lu a small but perfectly formed intimate restaurant with great views and excellent food this is not your usual tacos and refried beans this food is lovingly prepared and tastes wonderful during an eight day stay at the hotel i ate here three times recommend, my husband and i went here for happy hour perhaps with too high of hopes because we live near by and the view on the terrace is enjoyable

with the exception of two types of cocktails and a few beers more on this later happy hour consists of bogo 5pm 7pm
we started with one white one red sangria and chips salsa

i do not recommend the cs as it was basically just hot sauce and a personal size bowl of tortilla chips

the sangria came out in an ordinary wine glass with very small bits of orange in it and a lot of ice i had it in mind not to complain because we had already questioned the chips at 28<u+00a5> and i really just wanted to unwind after work but after 34 sips of wine i found the rest of my drink was just ice and water see pics so i complained and the problem was instantly rectified leaving me to believe that they must often take chances when making drinks hedging their bets that the customer will just accept it at 58<u+00a5> a glass that is not okay i want to show up after work and enjoy my drink not hand hold the bartender to make it properly
i will say that the replacement drink and second drink we asked for no ice were much more enjoyable and tasty

appetizers seem reasonably priced but after experiencing the chips i second guess the value entrees seem way overpriced and there was no one else around us eating for me to guage portion or quality

overall disappointed  i had hoped this could be an after work spot since it is dab in the middle of my home and office, located in the fraser residence shanghai mayita serves up tasty mexican meals with a little twist pork belly tacos were a savory delight featuring a citrus salsa the guacamole was fresh and the chipotle salsa had just enough kick chicken fajita plate was tasty served with warm tortillas on the side on a nice clear day you can sit outside on the patio and enjoy views of the pudong area its a bit pricey but certainly worth a visit great service and from the look of the crowd during the dinner hour when we were there a popular spot for western tourists and locals alike, there was some confusion on arrival as the waiter insisted that their promotional lunch was actually their usual business lunch where you can choose a taco burrito or enchilada with a soft drink juice tea or coffee for 88 rmb

i went with the two taco combo and the blackened fish and pork belly tacos were very tasty though i did find the portions to be small in fact including the tortilla chips salsa and refried beans with rice i left the restaurant still feeling a little peckish the portions seem geared towards the ladies or those who prefer a very light lunch my wife had the roasted cilantro chicken enchilada which she said was just okay

service was good and the meal took only 35 minutes the ventilation needs improving though as our clothes smelled of the cooking after the meal located at the previous fat olive eatery you have a good view of the surrounding neigbourhood and can sit on the verandah if the weather is good, wonderful atmosphere on the upper floor of the fraser suites hotel in shanghai i typically dont like to go to hotel restaurants they will always be a bit more expensive but this one was highly recommended and close to our home in peoples park sister restaurant maya in the french concession is a popular mexican upscale place but didnt go often since high price mexican isnt always what we were looking for id have to say mayita is the same but as long as you are prepared to pay a little more its a great choice
we were seated without a reservation although it was the tail end of chinese new year so since the place is small id recommend it service was very good for shanghai however most staff were not chinese or studied outside china so that would explain it but they worked hard to try to meet our needs menu variety is very good but dont expect a huge plate of tacos beans and rice like we do in the states dishes are more modest but well presented fresh and delicious if youre a vegetarian they have some choices like the quinoa and spinach empanada i had really delicious others opted for the taco combo 3 soft shell tacos of different variety filling drinks were good margaritas are a big high more for the premium tequila wine was reasonable for a restaurant like this highly recommend a try if youre in the area, i ate at this restaurant on my last trip to shanghai in december the restaurant is well located and in the city centre the restaurant has a good range of vegetarian options

its tex mex but the quesadillas were pretty good as was the soft tacos one of the better mexican restaurants i have been to in shanghai its a bit pricier then the rest of the mexican restaurants around, about 2 years ago i went with four other people to their sister maya restaurant i gave the maya a bad review which the maya 100 deserved  this is a new restaurant for the chain opened at the fraser residence hotel food was good not really mexican calmex or texmex it is an invented mexican style however it was fresh and tasty for myself and the two guests with me service this time was good it was not crowded when i went to maya about 2 years ago it was one of the worse service and food i ever had and i reported it i am glad that mayita was a good experience and when i return in a few months to shanghai i will go here again, very nice place with terrace and nice view authentic food at reasonable prices for shanghai lunch at rmb 88 excellent qualityprice relation, st visitreally looking forward to going back next monthambience and atmosphere very goodfood was delicious and very very reasonably priced
staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble
ooohhh and the chilli was one of the bestthankyou, similar food to parent restaurant maya very good awesome outdoor seating the only thing they were missing was the duck quesadillas though, the same people that brought maya restaurant and its great mexican food to shanghai have done it again we live in shanghai went for brunch and had 1 beef taco and 2 chicken tacos 3 tacos on a plate + chicken enchiladas exceptional these were smaller sized than expected so we ordered more after we finished the margaritas are very good the location a bit hard to find at first in an apartment building frazer residence once you get to restaurant it is quite niceon a good weather day choose to sit outside on patio fabulous in october we were told that fat olive greek restaurant used to be in this location went out of business hoping the mexican cuisine does much betterwe will be back, mayita is a good place for a quiet dinner in the middle of the week visited on a tuesday night and the place was about 70 full which gives some privacy food is good and especially like the ceviche cycling soup as well as the slow cooked pork and prawn fajitas

the service staff is also very professional and courteous they are of a high standard in meeting to your needs as well as checking if they can help in any other way","bar",0.98599369480638
19,"i really enjoyed their pan fried dumplings succulent and full of juicesi preferred the pork or yangs while my friend favored the shrimp you cant go wrong with dumplings here, this place is really good we had the whole variety of dumplings and the beef and dumpling soup good prices and really good food no wonders this place is so highly recommended, i know of people who doesnt eat seafood because of how it smellstaste i dont really know how to explain it exactly but if you know what i mean hello there the dumplings were very oily as well does not look appetizing does not taste good either actually felt a little nauseous after, simple authentic street style cheap  awesome  very good experience they even do the fillings and cooking in front of you go , dumplings were so nice  and also soup but the place was a bit dirty well i can understand it it was cheap and worth , very good dumplings will definitely come back it was quite cheap too i recommend taking a set of six with three different flavors, well what can i say about fried dumplings i love them and here you can find the right ones cooked at the moment theyre absolutely great try to believe, we came here to try their much coveted shengjianbao we ended up getting an order of each of their pork shrimp and vegetable each order comes with 4 buns

you place the order at the counter first bring your slip to the chefs in the fishbowl and then let them know if you want it for there or to go

the pork and shrimp ones were great the surprising hidden jewels for us were their vegetable buns that can out piping hot ultra thin skin and full of juice and veggies theyre almost like larger fried soup dumplings

we ended up hitting it up every day for breakfast for the next 3 days, i admit that reviews can be very personal and subjective and i am not a dumpling expert but over the last couple of days i have compared jia jia tang opposite this place din tai fung super brand mall and here and this one wins in my book please let me explain
if you like your dumplings posh din tai fung is hard to beat if you like them steamed cheap and cheerful go to jia jia tang but bring something to clean the table with you and expect the only dumplings to not be sold out to be the expensive crab ones but if you like your dumplings in your face up your sleeve all over the table with an atmosphere to boot come here this place is bonkers and i absolutely love it
i ate early evening and got a table straight away but i can see why some people struggle  downstairs is very tight i had one portion of pork dumplings and one of prawn couldnt see any beer on the menu the dumplings are definitely fried and initially seem dry compared to the steamed variety offered by the other two places above but they are big with a sesame coating on one variety at least and it is when you bite into them that you really do notice the difference they literally explode delicious hot  be warned sticky tasty ohsolovely juice all over the place  on the plate over the table over my hands even up my nose on one occasion and that was when i was prepared for it too absolutely brilliant crunchy base hard exterior and erupting liquid interior i preferred the more expensive prawn ones the most but was unable to order any more as i was stuffed and covered in juice  all for less than <u+00a3>4
atmosphere was noisy  shouting and chaotic  providing a great sense of backdrop to the chaotic meal i was enjoying
i needed two attempts at washing my hands  they were still sticky after the first soap and water process upstairs
it will take longer to wipe the grin off my face though cant wait to return, tried all 3 types of dumplings  we liked the pork ones the most a lot of soup in the dumpling and yet the skin was not overly thick and fried to a nice crisp arrived about 1030 to 11 in the morning and there was no crowd  come to this brunch coz its opposite jia jia tang bao and u can try both at the same time , went at 9pm after a massage and the dumplings were still piping hot and fresh was relatively empty which was a bonus loved the pork and the vegetable ones wasnt crazy about the prawn soup was not great but dumplings made up for it no english was spoken but the menu has english and pictures, you come here for the dumplings the soup is decent too the decor is not meant for those to linger there is often a lineup and it is often hard to find seating
you pick up your dumplings from the window where you can watch the cooks prepare this amazing meal and perhaps avoid seeing how much oil they use
the dumplings all 4 varieties are crispy and bursting with goodness and the price is incredible as well you must visit this popular chain at least once when in shanghai, this is an extremely popular fried dumplings joint on one of the most welltrodden touristfriendly food streets in the city its a big chain too so you know what to expect the dumplings are extremely juicy i actually managed to scald the inside of my nose when the juice of one badboy spurted out at an awkward angle which was a novel experience to say the least so watch out the prawn version is best no doubt about it to a british chinese takeaway veteran i can liken it to the best prawn ball you ever had 18 rmb <u+00a3>170 for 4 beauties
the way it works is you have to get your food and then get seated which at this time of year is a dogeatdog strategic game and then ever after that your meal is suspiciously eyed by people without seats mentally urging you to get on with it so they can have yours its not exactly helpful when youre trying to relax and us brits do like our personal space
if youre ok with this sort of pressure to eat fast then its 5 stars if not then a definite 4, it is not among my favorite places here in sh but is good for a quick lunch they do not speak english and the service is not really helpful but you can menage somehow the dumplings are good also if i prefer the steamed type
the choise is limited on what they have available at that moment but generally there is something vegetarian and something with meat
if you are around you can stop and try, right across from jia jia this is the fried dumpling with soup tasty but a little heavier and oily than the normal xlb expected wasnt the best sheng jian bao i have had but a good pit stop after jia jia, a restaurant business that you can see many stores over shanghai

the interior environment is trendy that is different as the traditional restaurant

fried dumplings  different from xia long bao still very juicy in the dumplings and better to be careful when eat because it is too hot however personally i like steamed dumplings more as fried dumplings are too oily for me, shengjian bao are the next gen soup dumplings somehow fried but loaded with soup the traditional dumplings are delicious but the shrimp dumplings are out of this world accompany the dumplings with soup several noodle options and a very spicy hot  sour soup queue in front of the register order from the menu there is an english version pay and then take your receipt to the front window where youll be asked if you want your dumplings to eat there or to go if you are eating in know that there is a second floor which has lots of seating if you order anything other than dumplings youll get a numbered stand which youll bring to your table and the waiters will bring the rest of the food to you, there are many different styles of dumplings you can try but if youre looking for soup dumplings with a bit thicker of dough than din tai fung and a crispy bottom you cant beat yangs i dont think ill ever be able to eat dumplings in the us ever again and even better its only 8 rmb for 4 dumplings and theyre big warning though the soup inside is very hot, check out my reviewsive reviewed over 90 hotels and i think this is the first restaurant thats how good yangs is omg so wonderful got the 4 pork dumplings and wonton soup either one would have been good as a meal but both were recommended so i wanted to try them i think they were only 8 rmb eachsome crazy low amount that made this experience even more astounding and located in the heart of shanghaiwonderful i didnt read other reviews if people dont mention it you order at the counter line goes up to order point from outside once you order theres a menu you can point to if you dont speak chinese   you get a table tent with a number i put that on the table then went to the outside window to pick up my dumplings or some order very similar the point is you have to go get the dumplings at the outdoor window once you order and pay if you dont know that going in you might get confused dont be bashful asking someone else if you can share their table its common definitely go these were so amazing i really am not sure ill eat dumplings againdont want to ruin the memory , short walk from peoples square metro station huge  crowded interchange

small store with limited seats along the way on the same street are many bigger restaurants with touts outside seeking tourist dollars which should be avoided

simple nice meal and kind on the wallet especially the shrimps fillings if youre a seafood lover

noodles are also available, we stayed at le royal meriden and the concierge recommended this place we had the the six dumpling set each 2 of each of the prawn spinach and meat xiao long boa for 16 rmb super cheap lucky we arrived early around 5pm as queues were forming and tables were limited excellent xiao long boa soup filled dumpling prawn was my favourite but all awesome, panfried bun<u+751f><u+714e><u+5305> is a famous food in shanghai so this time i chose this restaurant to try the panfried bun at that time i ordered a dish of panfried bun there are six buns and the bun include pork and sesame when i try one full of soup was flowing out it was scalding my tongue so you must be careful to eat the panfried bun in addition i ordered an oil tofu qianzhangbao vermicelli i really surprised on this it was very taste the material are oil tofu vermicelli qianzhangbaomeat wrapped in yuba and special soup the taste was very light shanghai has a lot of heavy food like the panfried bun eat more will be too greasy but the vermicelli was special it was suitable for cantonese taste at least i love this food very much and the environment was normal but many people go to try the food so i want to suggest you when you want to go to yang�s fried dumpling you may choose monday to friday because there will be many people on holiday it can save time to go to other places, i stay at the jw marriott just so i can come here and across the street to jia jia tong bao for breakfast

the prices are starting to creep up a bit but their dumplings are so damn goodmy breakfast consists of eight regular pork dumplings and a bowl of their incredible hot and sour noodle soup the total cost $345

love this place, this place is an excellent authentic shanghai dumpling place and you dont need to go anywhere else the bottom of dumpling is fried to crispy the inside is juicy and tasty meat and wrapping is the just right proportion will be back again, they were real shanghai friend dumplings the place is a dive which makes it all the more authentic skip the soup  it was flat but do stop by for a real treat, we only had the ordinary pork yangs dumplings they were completely delicious and cheap possibly the most delicious thing we had in china there is a menu in english you can point to you take your receipt to the window opposite the till where the chef is doing his thing and they will sort you out with your dumplings we also ordered drinks the first time but never figured out how to get them not sure it mattered, all i can say is its a tasty place to go ive been a repeat customer each variety is worth trying soups ok as well, every guide and traveler has recommended these dumplings and im here to add to the momentum service is super fast  soupy items are delivered to your table and the dumplings are picked up at the window near the cashier these are really cheap eats, the dumplings here are little balls of heaven short walk from our hotel marriott city center on an awesome dining street with everything imaginable being cooked up yangs is in the middle of it all and for us it was even better than the reviews made them sound had the pork and the crayfish but excellent and the browned bottom of the dumpling is the money bite also had the wonton soup which is very good despite long lines each of the three times we went we never had to wait more than 5 minutes from arrival through paying to getting your dumplings they have multiple levels of dining rooms so if the group floor looks packed just walk to the back and head upstairs this place is great, after three weeks in china we did not rate the food and then we had the famous yangs dumplings in shanghai these rescued the food reputation of china utterly delicious and cheap  you get to order a variety and see them being cooked as you wait at the kiosktype window before taking them to the restaurant area upstairs
i am not a dumpling person  who can get excited about a blob of boiled dough but just go to yangs and you will be bowled over with these delectable things with a variety of fillings a small unpretentious upstairs restaurant not far form exit 8 of people square it was pouring with rain and we battled to find it  so glad we persevered  fantastic  do not miss this oh and find out how to eat them or the delicious sauce will spurt all over you, my friend insisted that i needed to try yangs if i wanted to state that id been to shanghai i had the shrimp dumplings the meat dumplings and then the next day the pork rib soup let me tell you guysthese are some of the best flavours i have ever tasted the dumplings were stellar but the soup is rock star worthy, my partner amd i loved the dumplings from this place we tried about four different places however these ones were by far our favourite and being only a pound in english money there are fantastic value definitely worth a visit, very close to the radisson hotel where i stayed and it was recommended by a friend the shop was pretty small and with not a lot of seats i suppose many bought take out as the environment was not the most comfortable for a sit down meal i bought some fried dumplings and took them back to the hotel for a quick meal and atlas the dumplings were crispy on the outside and the pork filling was really juicy it must taste even better if i had it at the store when it came off the frying pan will strongly recommend that you try it at the store for the best result will not mind to go again next time i am in shanghai, recommended by a friend that that this is a musttry shop in shanghai and it didn�t disappoint us
the fried dumpling was really good quite big portion and with a very reasonable price, this is a big chain now but still serve great fried dumplings just a note about ordering head inside and pay then take your ticket to the kitchen to get dumplings seating is a bit tight so most people get it take away

tip  head here first and grab 8 dumplings to go and then line up at jia jia tang baohuanghe road where the line is very long

also  do not trust the tripadvisor gps the location is wrong search using huanghe road and you will find it, eventually found the restaurant with help from some friendly locals but it was worth the search as the dumplings are delicious address is correct but map location on tripadvisor isnt so plan on another app before setting out, i went there just to have a quick dinner with a friend the dumplings were nice but nothing special the environment was just a typical chinese chain i dont think is a place to go for a date or something special only for fast meals, yang<u+00b4>s friend dumplings is a chain of chinese fast food spots you can find them through shanghai their dumplings are soft on the top crispy on the bottom and juicy inside on your first visit i recomend to take 6 for 16rmb it contains two of each meat veggie and lobster, our son who was studying in shanghai china took us to yangs we went back a second time in our brief 4 day visit to shanghai soup dumpling crisp on the bottom soft on top with sesame seeds he taught us how to eat them pick up with chopsticks put in spoon gingerly bite a little vent hole from which to suck some soup use caution because it will be hotthey are made to order do not waste the soup he admonished then eat the filling and yummy dumpling casing perfect too bad this gem isnt in boston, we came over after eating jia jia tang bao which was just opposite

we tried the original vers rmb 8 for 4 as well as the new lobster version rmb16 for 4 tasted awesome but a little oily but its still so awesome that we ate it again before leaving shanghai , if youre after a quick cheap and tasty meal this is the place to go they open very early in the morning so ideal to grab on the run the dumplings are delicious and served hot with a savoury filling and crispy base not the healthiest option but thats not why you would come here, here is an authentic nontouristy place to get sheng jian bao�fried soup dumplings these are different from the xiao long bao although the pork filling is similar if you have had xiao long bao make sure to try these too the filing is quite tasty and the dough around it is nicely crisp they are made fresh when you order, very oilysuper oily
i tried a better shengjianbao in a small restaurant in hangzhou before

its very cheap for me

first you look at the menu at the counter  chinese and english with pictures easy to understand what are you order  and told to cashier heshe will calculate the price you must pay first

second you get receipt from cashier and bring it to cooker next counter he look it if you order fried dumpling he will give you at once and if you order noodle and wonton  he will give you a sign number

third you find the table and place a sign number about 35 minutes a waitress will bring you a big bowl of noodle or wanton soup to you

enjoy, just off nanjing road small tabkes eat in or take away menu in english fast and hot  ready any time, we took out a couple of boxes meat dumplings and spicy lobster dumplings the menus are in english limited there isnt much seating so we did take out when we ordered we were given a receipt that you need to take to the take out counter but the man didnt tell us anything ordered in mandarin anyway we got them and took back to hotel be careful when eating there is soup inside so you need to bite off a corner or the top and catch the soup or it will run down your shirt i liked the texture  soft on the top and crispy on the bottom good eats, amazing dumplings i cant get enough if you dont speak chinese and are worried about ordering its really easy you go to the register to pick what you want and to pay they have a menu with english translations in the counter you then take your receipt and pick up your dumplings at the window along the street let them cool down a bit before you take a bite because the stuff inside is really hot","sport bar",0.556182093939009
190,"i ate dinner here and selected the smoked chicken pizza  which was freshly cooked and tasty

the service was polite the menu was straightforward pizzas and the surroundings are very simple

i have no complaint with the food  but to score a 5 this would need to be outstanding

great place to be for italian expats , restaurant maybe looks so simple and not so attractive but believe me this is the best pizza i ever tried
the owners are an italian couple super friendly and nice
not only pizza is delicious they have some other italian dishes that also are worth to try
is not as expensive as other places and you can have a very nice and charming dinner as we had, hungry  quick bite  very good pizza  nice italian guy  very tasty  reasonable  what else you need  really good  cheers, this pizzeria is owned and run by a charming couple from venice it may be a little tricky to find even though its on the bund you have to go down a few steps behind the bus stop  im very glad pizza vera was introduced to me by a chef of one of the top fine dining restaurants in shanghai
finally a pizzeria that serves great pizzas in shanghai my favorites are vera etna and buffalo mozzarella the crust is crispy and light the toppings are tasty and delightfully composed
they also have an interesting selection of imported beers and wines","Indian cuisine",0.999730066878967
192,"this is the second time visiting this restaurant first visit food was great but didnt come out together 2 of us had finished our mains before the others had even got theirsand starters appeared at same time as mainthis can be the norm in china weve been toldso we were prepared this second visit however everything was on time this timefood was lovely good portion sizesdeserts lovely we didnt book but got s table for 6 easily, we were craving pizza stumbled across this staff speaks very good english pizza is thin crust we were pleasantly surprised how good it was prices are very reasonable they also serve pasta, excellent thin crust pizzas at reasonable prices good service made me visit thrice in 3 days tried 3 different pizzas as i am big thin crust pizza fan photo of pizza is trifolata at cny 79, my wife and i went here to have dinner we ordered pizza and pasta both were delicious we were shocked and impressed that the waiters here can speak very good english, i went there for dinner twice the food is pretty good all fresh and made in an open kitchen just inside the restaurant first time service was was excellent second time a bit slow even with less people around check for their specials discounted pizza trails and free flow beer, super convenient if you are at the portman ritz carlton this restaurant serves great pasta and pizza at really decent prices
i had the rigatoniexcellent my partner had the pizza americanosuper thin crust and tasty
highly recommended its not fancyits just delicious, shanghai isnt probably the best place to find a good pizza but this will be your best chance probably not as good as the uk version of pizza express but a welcome change from the noodle based dishes we enjoyed elsewhere, fantastic place to go in shanghai good pasta good pizza  good beer  nice place nice viewnear to a fantastic mallneed to go, dont expect much the classic pizza are really tinyand really expensive staff dont know how to deal with client disappointment, to be honest china is not a city you would find good pizza anyway
if you are really after pizza then this is a fairly decent option
service is on par with restaurants of similar quality  again not a city where hospitality service is anything to rave about, this place was very convenient and fast service the pizzas were reasonably priced but the drinks cost almost as much as the pizzas lots of ex pats eating there, they have a good deal for 299 rmb 1starter 2main 1 dessert 2glass of wine or any other drink perfect for two persons the staff were fast and okey the place is nice, at first i had no intention of going in here but i am glad we did
everyday they have a special offer that includes 1 starter unless you choose the soup of the day then you get 2 2 main dishes not only pizzas 1 dessert and 2 drinks including the house wines excluding the beers for 299 rmb
some dishes cost a bit extra but the menu card shows that pretty clear

the food quality was really good and the taste of everything was great i love the thin crust of the pizza it was more than enough food for me and my boyfriend they even packed the left over pizza for take away

the place looks well taken care off and the staff is super friendly

i definitely recommend pizzaexpress, if you have a pang for a pizza or pasta this restaurant is great after days of eating chinese food we welcomed a well cooked pizza from here, it was a busy day so the waiter missed one of our orders but as soon as we asked about what had happened he would offer to retake our order and as an apology to us we were offered a free drink

friendly staff good english compared to other places in china and of course delicious highquality food

definitely recommend it, it was great to find a well known pizza place in shanghai the pizza was great just think the service could have been a little speedier at the start, this is a place to relax or having a pizza when shopping downtown at shanghai centre recommend to sit outside, i come here quite often with my husband or family when they visit food is good but a little pricy they have a good selection of pizzas a nice hangout place for the weekend i say staff are not really friendly and dont really speak english though portions are big and the dessert selection is nice too, i like thin base pizza so this is the right one for me i like their two people combo serves with a starter a salad a main course a dessert and two soft drinks only 289rmb the smoke salmon is my favourite starter served with bread sticks and the breads are freshly baked i like the peiking duck pizza its usually cannot be found in other italian restaurant so really worth to try the soft drink if you choose ice tea can be refilled unlimitedly service is average overall it is an enjoyable place to go, we took the menu for two and everything was really delicious
pizza was really good thin crust very good tomato sauce and mozzarella
the tiramisu was really good as well home made
highly recommended, pizza and garlic bread are tasty the dough balls and nutella are a nice dessert the service was good even by shanghai standards it is a bit expensive, at pizzaexpress shanghai center i had a quite good pizza a nice thin crust choice between thin or thick crust and a good taste a little bit more cheese on it would make it excellent good service, it was our first evening in shanghai and after an over night flight it was great to find somewhere to eat close to our hotel the service was good and the pizza excellent, super fast tasty and authentic great service less than a 2 minute walk in the portman center from the a ritz carlton lots of other locations in town highly recommend if youve tired of the great shanghai food, we stopped here for takeout while staying at the portman ritz carlton the manager on duty was extremely friendly and helpful the place was almost full and there was an apparently strong delivery business too it took about 15 minutes to get our order we got the toscana pizza we took it right back to our room and ate it the crust was very very thin which we liked the sauce and cheese were good quality as was the sausage there could have been more sausage the only reason for four stars and not five is that the pizza was cold by the time we got to our room which was only about five minutes away might be best to eat it there if you go but we liked it a lot and will go back for sure, so i want to start by saying i never actually ate here unfortunately i was really looking forward to it after a long long day at work im traveling on business alone and decided not to go out with coworkers this time i was staying at the ritz carlton and wanted something good and somewhat fast and im a huge fan of italian style pizza its one of my all time favorites in fact im half drooling now between holding back the tears and stomach growls

so i walked in and wasnt sure if i needed to seat myself or wait to be seated as there was a host desk at the door so i stood there for a few minutes without so much as an acknowledgement so i passed the time with looking through the menu i went through the entire takeout menu a few times and then the dessert menu and then on to the done in menu needless to say i have them a chance to at least say please grab a table or ill be right with you no dice

i decided to give them the benefit of the doubt as i only saw 12 servers at a time and figured they were understaffed it wasnt until a couple walked in about 10 minutes after me that i realized they really didnt want my business they greeted this couple within 1 minute and actually looked past me to address them i was standing in front of them for crying out loud they took them right in and sat them down i even tried to say table for one but was cut off

ive had bad service but this nearly takes the cake terrible terrible service at best, the pizza is really good it is the best people could have in shanghai the service is ok the atmosphere is okay more importantly the pizza is really good worth a go~~ went there many times for authentic food definitely revisit, the pizza tastes like a real italian pizza and i know what i say having worked in italy for some time the service is appropriate even for western expectations on a very good level
overall a very nice experience in shanghai to find very good western food that is not just similar but very authentic, im italian and i live here in shanghai i was looking for a real italian pizzaand this is the right place its near jingan subway station the food is good and really italian its a bit expensive compared to chinese standard but really worth it, nice choice of italian food and pizzas they ask if u want thin or thick dough which is excellent since i do not like thick one took pizza with mozzarella and prosciutto they made quite good one

they have drought hoegaarden bear top choice freind had chicken salad and tomato soup soup first came cold but they immediately heated it and apologized

quick service

for top grade  the ambient is quite fast snack type so that is what is lacking

prices are on the expensive side, neat restaurant buzzing with people friendly service
pizzas are huge though hardly any choice for vegetarians but still better than other pizzerias salads are nice too great for a casual quick bite, ok pizza but nice quick service excellent for a quick bite if staying at portland ritz carlton  30 seconds away, ive visited pizza express last night and ordered spaghetti and meatballs i decided to take it back to my room at the portman take out service was very good and the people took care of me right away the food was excellent and it had a pretty good taste to it as well i would return again for this restaurant, always spend at least one dinner here with my design team good lasagna and accceptable pinot grigio

something for everyone

clean and efficient, i went to the restaurant in the hongyi mall

i was seated in the corner at a nice table i asked for a substitution on the special but the refused to accommodate i can understand this

the garlic bread was fresh but bland the pizza was really good

when my meal was served i requested a glass of water it never arrived nor did the bill i was completely ignored for half an hour i finally got up and paid

the lack of service ruined the experience for me, i had dinner there on a sunday evening after a day of shopping on nanjing xi lu i ordered a glass of wine 55rmb and a pizza with panceta gorgonzola and artichoke 98rmb it was delicious and i had leftovers which were packed up for me in a very nice box inside a reusable bag

the place was very clean and elegant and the staff spoke english the menu was in chinese and english i was impressed by the great service and the staffs eagerness to make my visit a pleasant one

i wasnt planning on getting dessert but i ended up ordering the dough balls with nutella 48rmb i should have followed the advice that jason my server gave me and forgone that for the ice cream and espresso the dough balls were dry and not warm like i had hoped jason was very nice and offered me a cappuccino on the house to go with my dessert

now that i am living in shanghai i will definitely return great service good food nice atmosphere, pizza marzano has very good pizza and pasta dishes the service was great and the price was right youll eat here if your staying at the portman for more than a week or maybe less highly recommend it to everyone that loves pizza, ive had better pizza for half the price at bertuccis boston washington dc and thats saying much because this is supposed to be gourmet pizza i ordered pizzas to go and specifically told them that i was coming at a certain hour which i did come right on the minute the pizza was obviously sitting there for over a half hour and was cold and disgusting moreover the flavor even after we heated it up was unimpressive im not going back, great pizza  cheese is good for shanghai pizza and it actually tastes like a high end pizza from the us one of my favorites desserts are good too marg pizza roman style is a big hit with me, i am italian and go often to shanghai
the appetizers are very good as well the pizza in particular if you like the pizza romans style very thin instead of the naples pizza pizza marzano is the place where you should go, on my visit to shanghai i stayed at the portman ritz carlton

my colleague and i were in a rush to get to another meeting and we decided to have a late lunch around 1500 at the pizza marzano outlet within the portman complex to avoid travel time

the restaurant was fairly empty at that hour and there were a lot of staff circling around not particularly engaged in specific activity

we ordered a rosemary flat bread as a starter my colleague ordered a spaghetti aglio olio and i went in for a pepperoni pizza

the rosemary flat bread came out fairly quickly it was very aromatic and very tasty

after a while my colleagues spaghetti dish came out as we were getting late i encouraged him to get started he informed me that the dish tasted fresh and was fairly good

i waited a few minutes for my pizza to make its appearance and then asked the waiter when i could expect it

i then saw some frenzied activity in the kitchen which usually signals a mess up

sure enough the waiter then came out and informed me they had forgotten to make the pizza

since we had to get to a meeting we declined to wait for them to start on the order just paid our bill and left

i personally would not go back, pizza in shanghaiyea just do it great change to the wonderful local food superb pizza great wine choice and super service good value and free wifi, next to the portman ritz hotel a small restaurant with italian flavor  friendly staff and short waiting time you can order thin or thick pizza both are good even parma ham was quite good
you can order even italian style starters and pastas
free wifi connection
pizza and coke 140 rmb, the restaurant is welllocated close to the ritzcarlton the staff is very friendly and the english level is really good but the food quality is very bad the lasagne was disgusting the tomato sauce was acid my two friends werent satisfied as well wont come back, i went to pizza marzano based on an internet search the margherita pizza was fantastic the atmosphere of the restaurant was wonderful the service is top notch im from new york city originally and i can assure you that this food will transport you to rome or new york or wherever your favorite pizza place is, we visited this restaurant from a recommendation and it was very good nice thin pizzas just as in italy youll pay around 90k a pizza they also have pasta and delicious desserts service is good and english menu + english speaking staff would definitely recommend this place if your in shanghai and craving for some italian food, the best pizza in shanghai when you have enough of chinese food this is the place to go

1 expensive  should be ~1015 lower price perhaps the expat effect, the pizza and salads are fantastic my salad had homemade mozzarella beets pinenuts pumpkin etc the pizzas at my table all had rave reviews the salmon and dill the beijing duck and the four seasons you cant go wrong the service too is spot on, its obvious that this chain is modelled on pizza express right down to some of the menu choices however this is no bad thing and we had a very good meal here and we were both impressed with the pizzas
we ate early circa 6pm but by the time we left at 730 people were waiting for tables service was quick there was a good choice of starters pizza pasta and salads we had a parma pizza and a carbonara pizza both with plenty of fresh tasty toppings and they were cooked perfectly with a cocktail and a glass of wine it came to just over 300yuan expensive for chinese standards but about average for western food
would recommend to anyone looking for a good pizza in shanghai","Italian cuisine",0.999759538794663
193,"i was taken to this place by our business partner very nice food good quality and a lot of varieties if you are in shanghai i highly recommend you visit this place, delicious dishes perfect peking duck liked the grilled diced tenderloin the teppanyaki pork neck a must dont forget to order the layers of crispy cookies with creme and fresh fruits the sea cucumber with chicken and ginger special only the staff is strange all the dishes are brought too fast the like to serve desert when you are halfway your main if you dont hurry up they just present the bill all very unprofessional respectless and impolite
so be careful eating from 800 pm onwards at 10 pm they close and they do everything to have the restaurant empty by then they switch on the main lights 5 minutes before 10
so the food wonderful the staff a nightmare thats why only 3 out of 5, located in jin an kerry center pretty convenient for a nice meal after a stroll window shopping along nanjing road w or after visiting the nearby jinan temple  always advisable to make a reservation unless you wont mind waiting for your tables restaurant is pretty big and takes up a floor in the center  with a common dining area and many private dining rooms amazing food is good service is good ambience is nice and can be a bit noisy specialty is the duck and dessert  fruit with bread  seems like their desserts are all good actually had a simple meal  tofu pork  meat  servings large hence go easy unless you have a large appetite or starved the day for this  there are 2 jade gardens outlets in shanghai and make a visit to this outlet, the food  service was very good and i have try lot of their specialty since we have 8 of us the hairy crab is special this time of year only available in the winter time from the lake, took two visiting friends here on two separate occasions so they could experience great chinese food not expensive but one of the best restaurant experiences in shanghai everything is traditional i think im australian so correct me if im wrong and the wait staff and lovely and helpful even though we were the only white people both times which is hard to come by in chinese restaurants here, my wife and i ordered roasted duck and beef brisket  both excellent remarkable sevice  duck carved at our table with great skilla memorable experience prices a bit steep but absolutely worth it we spent three weeks in shanghai and i think this was our favorite meal, this is one of my most favored chinese restaurants in shanghai high ceiling classic decor and half a minute walk from my hotel  grand millenium very convenience particularly after a long day of work quiet tonight but can be very noisy sometimes since we had small appetite a walnut pumpkin salad two smoked eggs the signature steam dumpling <u+5c0f><u+7b3c><u+5305> and wonton were more than enough to satisfy the tummy i have indirect friends working in this group and they confirmed this company is very principled in using high quality and safe food ingredients so no worry no hurry when you eat enjoy the food and your chat, had dinner with a large group while in shanghai for work because we were in a group the menu was selected for us we had some of the restaurants signature dishes the food was very well prepared and presented ceremoniously i wouldve liked a little more spice with my dinner but my colleagues assured me that traditional hong kong fare is not spicy the restaurant itself was clean and well kept the waiters did not speak or understand english but hey  were in shanghai so no fault there overall it was a great experience and i would recommend to others if in the area, i had the pleasure going to this restaurant with a friend who is living in shanghai
we had a huge variaty of different delicious plates ordered i really enjoyed this evening you should make a reservation early try to not on the same day, very nice very comfortable restaurant easy for those without a chinese language to order with confidence but still seemingly authentic the handpulled noodles were amazing as were the excellent sweet dim sum especially the red bean paste buns <u+00a3>20 bought a very nice meal for two including pudding would happily go again and explore more of the menu, we got pork in sauce some steamed veggies a rice thing and 4 steamed bunsand two waters was 260 kuai maybe this is average for shanghai but it felt like a lot of money for how little food it was and the quality the view would have been nice if they had sat us by it at first we were sat by the noisy room where they were dumping dishes with no view then we were moved to a room in the back of the main dining room the water was like 10 rmb per 6 oz i saw a bunch of people get this fruit and bread desert that looked good they brought us the wrong food at first then we ordered 2 plain white rices for 9 rmb each and never received them on the plus side the bathroom is nice, we asked our resident colleague for the name of a good restaurant  he suggested this one and we were not dissapointed the food was tasty and the service was good  although the waiters did not speak english but we managed to negotiate the menu, this restaurant chain is wellknown in shanghai for its nice environment  food quality the choice is not so wild but every dish we tried is satisfactory some of young staff need more training as they didnt respond to our request promptly and easily forgot what we ordered, heard about jade garden for a long time but heard that theres always a long line for dimsum lunch went there in november for an early dinner 530pm and got an table easily sad thing is that they dont serve dimsum at night but the whole meal was nice their bbq meat was good and dessert quite creative was excellent happy to be back one night for dinner and heard that its still not easy to get a lunch reservation seems like you have to book 2 months ahead for a table for lunch good service, what a wonderful culinary experience we were a large group 23 and received a warm welcome for lunch food was extraordinary  tasty +++ authentic experience, i am definitely coming back to this place the food and the service are great eventhough the food is a bit pricey what can you say it�s in jingan district but it is worth the money if you have chance this place is worth a try i love the siewmai and the crispy skin young pork is my favourite i believe many of the waiters or so called �fuwuyuan are from hongkong they can speak cantonese, if you are staying in shanghai and looking for a really good hong kong food i would strongly recommend this restaurant service and food are good, it is difficult to fault this restaurant yan an xi road branch the food is really good and service too, when i arrived there were 30 people in front of me queuing for a place since we arrived at 115pm the wait was just 20 minutes as the crowd was leaving the place i rate this place as the best dim sum restaurant in shanghai , this place has such raving reviews from the local community that i had been dying to go for a while now the result was somewhat disappointing but still worth a visit under the right circumstance tips at the bottom

first the cons i umst say the locals are crazy trend chasers whose taste levels i honestlly cannot phantom

1 i�ve heard that usually the line in the morning could be up to 2 hours this is definitely not worth anything over a 30 minute wait

2 the most ordered item is the 101 napoleon which absoutely sucks the cream is made with horrible ingredients it took me one bite for my taste bugs to sense it

3 i�m not big fan of rooms with no windows and most of its rooms do not have windows

now the pros the food is actually very good and not just for this price

1 the twodeck dim sum set is good quality as well as the honeyglazed pork overall i�d say it�s a 7 out of 10 compared to hakkasan�s dim sum which i put at 8 out of 10

2 for two people 450 rmb is wayyyyy more than enough that�s about half of what you�d spend at hakkasan for brunch very good value

3 the environment is actually not bad clean and highend looking if you can manage to get a window seat i imagine it�d be a really good experience but i don�t think there are a lot of those

tip
if you want to visit but don�t want to wait the long line come late in the afternoon the restaurant stops serving at 3pm and last time they let customers in is 245pm if you arrive after 2pm the wait should be no more than 20 minutes  at least that was the case for me this past sunday

also i have heard that you can make reservations but that it has to be months in advance if you�re not in a rush though could do that and remember to ask for window seats if possible i really think it would help the dining experience so so much, despite language barriers we managed to have a very nice dinner with pork and duck asparagus and bamboo sprouts and dumplings the pork was particularly delicious the duck good but lots of bones this did not seem to be a restaurant that served rice for my husband this means something for me not it could be that there was a failure to communicate our waiter was very attentive though it was interesting pointing out what we wanted there was actually some lovely dinner music with a piano and violist it was sort of old american favorites but still nice i would recommend this restaurant try to learn a few food chinese words though, jade garden is one of those great chinese restaurants which are not overpriced offer great quality food and very good service their menu is very varied i strongly advise the xiaolunbao pork dumplings with liquid inside them they are definitely one of the best i have had in china
recommended place to eat, this is one of the best cantonese southern cuisine restaurants in shanghai there are few must try dishes like bbq babe pork dim sum dumplings the napoleon cake every table will have one always packed so you need to book at least few days in advance great for business and family gathering a bit pricy but worth your money, ive been here several times the food is wonderful service is prompt and layout is ample this is very good cantonese food but be prepared to pay a bit for it also make a reservation i would guess you could wait over an hour if you dont i am consistently amazed at the amount of people waiting when we go there if you dont have a reservation i would not even attempt it, looking at the glowing reviews posted for its sister restaurant at peoples square i am left wondering if this jade garden in the jing an kerry centre is actually operated by the same hong kong company

since opening its doors this place has become a much sought after venue by the local community and if you want to get a reservation here you have to book well and truly in advance apparently  or you do what we did this last weekend going early in the morning and liningup to get on to the wait list for lunch the 2 hour 20 minute wait wasnt too bad i suppose but was it going to be worthwhile passing time to this extent to get a table in this place simply putno it was definitely not worth the wait

we ordered a few dim sum dishes off the special dim sum menu and a whole duck off the a la carte menu  there was no option or opportunity to order a halfduck most  but not all  the dim sum dishes were good and we got the impression that the beautifullytaken photographs used in marketing the dishes in the a la carte menu were not necessarily accurate on arrival to tables

the most disappointing element to our lunch here at jade garden was the duck i wrote recently about the truly excellent duck to be enjoyed at xindalu at hyatt on the bund though there were some service issues there but here at jade garden the duck wasnt truly crispy and when the station waiter carved it on a sideboard it was oozing with liquid fat and more concerning was that under the skin were still huge amounts of fat clinging to the skin though the waiter tried to carve these off added to this the sizes of the pieces of skin carved were simply too big making it difficult to assemble the contents of your pancake and even more difficult to eat may be the demand for this restaurant and consequently for the duck means that the preparation and cooking processes needed for really good duck are being totally compromised we were not the only table leaving quantities of skin on the plate either

jade garden pricing is probably at the highend as cantonese restaurants go in shanghai the service here is undertaken by waitstaff who are clearly too busy to raise even a smile so be prepared for perpetual long and unenthusiastic faces during your meal despite the stylish uniforms that have been implemented the waitstaff do not seem to know how to carry it off and nobody from the management is clearly caring  probably so long as the money is rolling in the decor of the place is in a pleasant understated contemporary style and tables of two are fortunately placed by the windows in the various sections of the dining room areas

despite all this we will most likely come again but we will know what not to order next time my suggestion for those wanting excellent cantonese cuisine stay at the peoples square branch of jade gardendont venture over here","steakhouse",0.999781604266876
195,"my wife and i went here for a date and we were not sure what to expect so you have to pick one of the 3 menus 400 500 or 600 rmb and then the chef will prepare the plates which are presented beautifully and most of them are delicious we were seated upstairs which made the experience more unique and private our waiter a spanish raised guy with chinese parents was really good at explaining to us the different plates and wine options totally recommend if you are up for some fun and refined dining, we ordered the 10 course surprise menu the service was outstanding but the food was the superstar i photographed every course magic presentation brilliant taste just breathtaking do you think i liked it you want to believe it, we have the set menu at the lowest price with 3 appetizers and 2 main courses portion not big but each dish surprised us with nice presentation and delicious food like it a lot the dessert is award winning, new restaurant on the shanghai scene and very different from what has been seen the menu proposes many small dishes ~10 full of different tastes sabor despite the number of dishes you dont find yourself overwhelmed great experience full of flavors i will definitely go there again, we walking back from the bund and looking for a venue for an afternoon drink as a longshot we noticed a very classy looking restaurant with some people inside its not common it seema that the highend end venues stay open between lunch and dinner sittings so it was a good find
we were welcomed with a very warm smile from a lovely spanish accent sat us down and asked if wanted to eat or just drink we were only interested in a drink which were promptly served while sitting there enjoying our drink were given 2 small items from the taating menu on the house they were devine so i looked it up online and dound it way down the list which seemed a little odd we were too interested now not to come back and dine so we did
they offer 3 sizes of tasting menus so we opted for 10 courses very reaable priced and generouse size portions
the influence of the menu is a little unusual but it works

i rate this place as great value for quality of the food and setting

we noticed diego wondering around the restaurant and visited a couple of tables so if there was one dissapointment it was that he didnt stop at our table this isnt a nagative just an observation

i would defintley go back, i should say at the outset that i was at a special dinner so i cannot vouch for a dinner off the menu the chef here has links back to a michelinstarred establishment in madrid so no surprise the food was very creative fusion food often fails because frankly the tastes dont often come together and even clash at times but here they really get it right some of the dishes had light thai influences like lemon grass and pandan leafso you really get an explosion of tastes the ceviche here is done in a tomato soup stock unique and very interesting try the single oyster in an almond milk cream or beef undercooked then smoked in special smoking boxes just go an try the food this may not appeal to everyone but you will certainly get an amazing taste experience the sommelier a charming lady is very knowledgeable on both wine and food the serving staff here all local are very well trained unusual in shanghai, business dinner with a partner and i would say the restaurant atmosphere is elegant chic with good music but not disturbing volume so that you can quietly talk to the guests the menu is very simple as it is a selection of 9 10 or 11 course no idea what will come as the menu of the day would be inspired from the morning fresh market visit of the chef accordingly it would be difficult to pairing a wine and this is a lack of the proposal in my opinion talking about the food it is a fusion cuisine not all the courses are outstanding but overall my experience i would say its been more than satisfactory good job chef guerrero, visited this restaurant for dinner and had a really great time exploring many creations of delicious food disguised in unexpected forms will definitely revisit, came here on a date with my husband interior is fine location near the bund we really enjoyed the good food and i can recommend this place here are the points that would make this an even better place to me the menu is divided in three different prices and offers no details on the courses ask the waiter for that but they can also be wrong each table has to order the same menu there is no wine pairing no amusebouche at the beginning or petits fours at the end really good food but it somehow lacks a bit of charme for sure i will try it again in a few weeks, went with family and friends to celebrate a birthday so we were 6 persons we had a table on the balcony area which was ok but the service was a little disappointing as known there is a set menu and you just decide on the number of courses but we were simply asked which menu we would take without explanation or requests we had two vegetarians in the group and one person who did not eat raw fish so can guess what arrived we did bring it to the waiters attention and that point arrangements were made to offer some alternatives overall the food was nicely presented and there are interesting combinations and flavours an ok experience overall surprisingly the place was not busy for a saturday night which may be explained by its location in not such a great street behind the bund given the choice of restaurants nearby, a large spacious restaurant there was no menu one just chooses how many course you want we went with the 11 course menu or rmb500 and were delighted throughout
the one bite starters were the pick of the menu and had everyone talking about the flavors they experienced they varied from oysters packed on smoking sea weed to a fois gras mousse between crispy wafers reminiscent of peking duck
each course was introduced by our waiter and the service was well paced
a great night out and great value, everybody should try it
it is not only about eating it is about experiencing a new worldgo in and rely on them
tasty and fascinating, where to begin our host ordered so much food all of which was beautifully presented and delicious beautiful decor great ambience cant wait to dine there again when back in shanghai","dumpling restaurant",0.999845592793884
196,"relaxed restaurant with french owner and staff speaking french placed in the heart of shanghai you will maybe need you smart phone map to find the place as it is placed in an alley but when found you are up for a treat burgers and stakes that seems high quality great for an end of a busy week we will be back with friends, this place is generally good quality dishes good creative menu nice environment with very ample indoor covered outdoor and total outdoor seating

the good is that generally during the weekend they put out kids play things an air castle for bouncing and playing while the parents eat good place

service still needs some common sense the senior people who have been here a long time are great the average staff who for example answered the phone tonight are not up to proper service standards for example i asked if the kids play things would be out tonight since i was planning to go to dinner with friends and we wanted to make sure there was suitable things for kids to do so we can let them play while we eat the person who answered the phone said yes and when we arrived only 2 hours later nothing for kids was there the senior staff offered to put it all back out and set it up the problem is the person on the phone should ask more detailed questions if they planed to take it down he should have either told us or not taken it down knowing we were coming in i even noted on my reservation what we wanted for kids and it was not there

the menu still is decent despite losing their original french chef, a must to try in shanghai just the best burgers of the city but not only they got also some crazy delicious rib eye
the owner martin is just awesome and will warmly welcome in his restaurant, i stopped here on a sunday for lunch i started with a mojito it was not only tasty but good sized and actually packed a punch unlike many of the cocktails at the ever growing population of specialty cocktail bars in shanghai i started with an appetizer of 24 month iberico ham the taste was quite good for a relatively young ham i would only comment that i prefer thinner slices the home made pickles served with the ham were excellent my burger showed up a bit too quickly as i had not finished my appetizer probably a good thing as the burger was huge along with fries i quickly realized my eyes were bigger than my stomach i had too much food the burger is very very good i would say the patty has a bit too much black pepper to be an absolute top of the top burger though the bun is special as it is home made and tasty toppings are delicious and generous the service was friendly but not especially attentive i would believe during a busy period service could struggle this was an extremely rich and filling meal i certainly did not need dinner as this meal kept me full until bedtime this would be my first choice for a burger in shanghai, a nice quiet place big terrace wonderful team  a very friendly boss the meat is really good very few places in shanghai can serve so good meat wines are also nice prices are quite affordable , went there for dinner the owner france guy made some recommendations to us the wine and also steak were excellent good service and fair prices
next time we will come back for sure, it has been about 6 months since my last visit to this nice little restaurant and i immediately regrettet not being here more often
first of all the service on that night was outstanding there was no reason to complain at allstaff was very friendly and always there when you needed something
what makes this gem so unique is that it is not your typical burger place but more of a wine bar that serves burgers and the wine really is good
now coming to the most importatnt thing the food in our group of 4 we ordered the american dream the italian job and the vegan tofu burger and they were all awesome the meat is done perfectly and the bread is not your standard hamburger bun but freshly baked it is just great and i could recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger in shanghai
will definitely come back, been there several times and i have to say that the beef ribs are very reasonably priced and the burgers are also very good highly recommended, been there couple of times and always had great dinners here the owner martin is very helpful in the wine selection and the staff is well trained and friendly dishes are superbs burgers steaks but the best part is the cotes de boeuf ribs at a very affordable price for a city as shanghai i recommend the gratin as side dish
the only thing they could improve is dessert but anyway most of the time you are so full that it doesnt matter solid happy hours too, i live in shanghai and found wine must a few months ago i have visited many times food is good and the staff are friendly and helpful i would highly recommend this restaurant for anything from drinks to business dinners, we have been here for the burger and the wine we expected high quality and this is what we got the taste of the burger was good however the size way to small for a grown up the small size of the burger therefore makes it expensive because you actually need two to be satisfied
the wine selection is nice they have a couple of good wine matching the food they offer

to sum it up good burger of small size for a high price and really good wine, on any trip your get a craving for home well must grill is the place to go for a great burger fries and brew started out as a wine bar then graduated to comfort food must offers a great selection of wine if beer isnt for preferred libation we visited on wednesay and seats filled up inside as well as the patio we picked thi day because its buy one get one free note this doesnt include there signature omg burger angus beef foie gras wine and mushrooms, had the italian job burger with fries and a glass of white
burger was perfectly done and very tasty and tasted fresh fries were nice as well
nice winecellary ambience wine menu also looks great will definately go there again, steaks are good service good tried the burger was good too wine list is great and place is very cute a solid little fun steakhouse without pretense note many people complain they cannot make any cocktail besides gin tonic and they only have mostly belgium beer, the first time we went to this place we had a fantastic experience our steaks were perfectly prepared the sauces were delicious and the chocolate fondant desert was freshly prepared we went back on their twoforone burger night and the place was packed the burgers were average the service was slow and the fondant was a stale muffin with a little chocolate in the middle id avoid the place if its crowded, friendly place with large terrace nice staff and delicious burgers  dont miss this place to shanghai, its not for no reason that my friends and i go to must grill almost every week
the terrace is very nice and can accommodate big groups of friends and we can easily celebrate private parties such as birthdays it is a bit hidden from the street which in the end is a great thing to enjoy a sunny lunch or a festive dinner it is ideal for parents with kids as the courtyard is safe no cars around and the restaurant offers some great toys for kids to play especially during the weekend with a bounce castle
about the food i would definitely recommend to try the burgers first simply big juicy tasty they have a large selection of burgers including one vegan option 
for wine lovers i am sure you will find what you�re looking for otherwise you could ask andy their manager to give you some recommendation� he is a delight
last every tuesday you can enjoy a buy one get one burger it�s time to go with friends and try it out enjoy, the menu selection isnt huge but the burgers were exceptional mine was bee with a piece of bacon some pulled pork cole slaw and cheese it was outstanding perfectly cooked to order


we brought kids they had a little play area with a movie playing outdoor seating was nice but kinda in a parking lot, i have had most of the burgers here as well as lamb chops and steaks they have other nice dishes as well for the lighter eaters thin light french pizza fish and veggie options

the american dream burger is about as awesome as they come a large burger patty topped with bacon and pulled pork yes pulled pork on a burger its not only a great idea it tastes awesome they use a great large crystal salt on the grilled veggies which adds a great crunch

the restaurant has both inside seating semienclosed outside seating and full outside seating weekends they have brunch and space for kids with toys and a big blow up kids castle to play in, this is a nice bistro serves in particular good burgers with a reasonable price if you come on tue theres buy one get one for free i loved my signature burger which served with onion jam on top a great bottle of wine from bordeaux costed me 280 rmb only overall servers are very friendly and the place was full all the time
well done, we tried the beef rib for 2 people wich was excellent and very generous was the best french fries i had in a long time perfect with bbq sauce i couldnt enjoy the nice terrace because it was raining but i had a good time in the veranda","vegetarian restaurant",0.999815239258562
197,"fine fusion food at its best lovely terrace in the trees its a go to address among expats betty the owner knows her stuff and does it well warm welcoming with great service basmats gorgeous huge portraits greet you as you enter dont miss the excellent ginger mojitos textured shoga salad tuna tartar ceviche, very good brunch at ginger by the park with nice weather we were sitting at the terrace very cosy and chill
we took 1 brunch set for 148rmb which comes with a platter of starters the tomato pesto rice bites with parmesan and the sambar vegetable curry pappadum were specially tasty the latter a bit spicy and as a main course i chose ochatsuke rice with red snapper dashi broth wakame and genmai cha it literally tastes like the sea a good combination with tender pieces of snapper in a very tasty broth
besides the brunch set we tried the orange soup very recommended with a subtle touch of ginger is a great option and the pad thai which was also very good
on a sweet note the white miso chocolate mousse is very good but the portion is small
i will certainly be back to try more dishes, ive had two meals at ginger on this visit to shanghai the food is great  the menu has many tempting choices but i loved the various lettuce wraps the chicken one is very spicy but delicious and the salads are huge and healthy the orange soup s wonderful the service however is spotty today it was slow and our waiterwaitress was super grouchy didnt explain dishes well never smiled and needed prompting to bring even a glass of water a friendlier fellow helped with dessert but this place needs some smiles it was crowded but not overly  certainly not enough to warrant the grouchiness its in a terrific residential area and full of expats  many different languages were spoken and is so attractive its worth a visit for any time of day or meal it would be five star if they were friendlier, food was fantastic as was the service definitely worth a visit whilst in shanghai i had their mentaiko spaghettini and ricotta pancake  both really nice make sure to book, i really did not like this place at all it was dreadful the food was average and the service really slow  i was not impressed we went here for brunch after hearing about it from a few people we arrived and it took 30 minutes to get someone to serve us then they kept forgetting what we ordered and brought several wrong drinks and dishes  the staff were friendly enough but really really slow the food quality was also not that good which was disappointing since i had heard good things about it the only positive is that it has a good terrace and is later out pretty nice i cannot recommend this to you as i am not a fan, this is somewhat of a unique concept in shanghai
they do their own thing

their rooftop is perfect for brunch with sparkling wine late summer, we went here for dinner with friends and ordered some of the starters to share all of the dishes were great soft shell crab tempura a simple but delicious tofu with salt and sesame ceviche tunammm
we want back for brunch on the roof terrace and had a delicious shakshuka and ricotta pancakes really recommended for some delicious high standard food and a cozy atmosphere, we came there for prosecco having something to celebrate dinner was eaten at another place very friendly atmosphere with good service, theres the ginger mojitos virgin or not theres the little elevated terrace in the trees and theres the multitextured delicious all time favorite shoga salad  and plenty of other tasty dishes to share or not the shakshouka the ceviche the tuna bits its small and cozy and warm one of the rare restaurants to have plenty of charm and be perfect for any meal breakfast lunch or dinner, amazing south east asian food in a fusion style cozy place nice service singaporean laksa was fantastic, ginger py the park offers a variety of fusion dishes in summer the rooftop is very popular  especially at the weekend for their brunch menu expect healthy food and freshly squeezed juices, we decided to try this place as it had good reviews and the web page looked good the restaurant interior looks great its set in 3 floors with an small out door terrace which could sit around 20 people the staff was very friendly and attentive prices range from 100300rmb depending on course a vegetarian pasta fro 100rmb and a wagu burger for 270rmb
as a previous reviewer i had the chicken passion fruit curry which must had been precooked earlier in the day and just reheated now the chicken was not very tasty it had that day old texture and taste the rice was dry and had the same reheated taste i<u+00b4>m not used to sending food out so this time when i probably should have i didnt think about it until we were leaving and someone asked how the food was when we actually let them know our concerns at this time which was too late i am aware of that nothing can be done to improve it however they did not seem to understand the concern either
if this restaurant was nearby and i was an expat living in the area i might give the place another chance to confirm our issues or probably enjoy a good meal if not precooked, had dinner with a colleague not here for the 1st time was always a pleasure to be  ginger service is fast and superfriendly jenny is hilarious and a superbe host  food was delicious had a chickenpassionfruit curry which hit the spot fierey tender and succulent will be back , so cute quaint and tasteful place looks tony but then you head upstairs to their diningroom and although its not big there are a number of tables for dining i peeked out onto their lovely terrace bit it was a bit muggy from impending rain so we sat indoors

cocktails were delicious food was tasty not fantastic but good ambience is wonderful for playing catchup with friends

service was great

want to come back for brunch, the place popped up on tripadvisor search the restaurant on first floor appeared more like a private terrace party very cozy amidst the natural ambience of tall trees in the back was surprised to see sufficient vegetarian options
grinding my own sesame seeds on tofu was new but the taste was excellent one could send that the ingredients were natural and fresh
loved the place, the service was good and attentive  rather uncommon in shanghai the food also was quite good i had the chicken tajine it was quite good but there was basically one chicken leg in the tajine and it was served with a small bowl of couscous it was not what i would expect from a tajine the appetizers were good and we had the prawn rolls and the dips overall the food was good, looking for good creative food in a soothing setting look no further than ginger by the park  a culinary oasis in the hustle and bustle of shanghai we love this place for brunch so we keep coming back try the laksa or the shashuka but i think you will be pleased with any choice, ginger is the sort of place you really hope you can enjoy it is tucked away in the french concession quirky floor plan nice terraces and promising menu for food and drinks my experience is our group of 8 navigated the little staircase sat down reviewed menu got confused hearing about the specials were told we had to move were told the specials did not apply to our group were served a starter on a chipped plate busboy broke a glass almost on top of me and meals were mediocre service was charming and slow next time i will wait until spring and just have a drink on the terrace suggest you do the same, yo can go there with a great expectation you will no regret it the menu is rather short but very well executed, i had lunch and brunch at ginger last week and they were each terrific i especially recommend the orange soup and the salads one with peanutchicken shreds the other w some sort of fish for brunch we really liked the middle eastern baked eggs sounded odd but was delicious served in a cute little cast iron pan the carrot noodles w cardamom were a wonderful way to get vitamin a and the children liked them too the drinks look wonderful but we abstained lots of fun service isnt terribly fast but it is friendly, we popped by ginger without any expectations it turned out to be a great evening their terrace where you felt like you sat in the tree was lovely we had some small dishes very good asian crossover i recommend to share the desserts as they turned out to be big enough for two persons this was our best evening in shanghai, nice place interesting mix of food great ambiance but 45 rmb for a smallish however nicely presented but not even particularly good cappuccino really that is almost 7 �
i like the place a lot but keep getting annoyed about value for money for some of the dishes and will now officially stop going there as those steep prices for a can of coke or this recent coffee example especially with lunch are just not ok for me however lovely the location, we live close by and have been there there times its a very cozy place great ambiance an great asian food the chrysanthemum tea is so tasty and the food is excellent great place for families with kids and dogs are allowed on the patio if you make a reservation afterwards take a stroll in the little park and watch the locals exercising and dancing a nice experience, this is a cool gem it exudes imaginations much thoughts and hearts must had gone into this restaurant to be what it is food was refreshingly different they called it world cuisine with asian touch it was a clever blend of chinese se asian western and japanese however it was serious cooking and amusingly well made the alcoholic and nonalcoholic drink lists was equally interesting to compliment the food located next to a park its sanctuary like ambient reminded me of lijiang  liberating timeless and homely ideal for that special date friends gathering or just spend a quiet afternoon with a good book my review may not do justice to this lovely gem go discover it yourself, i am staying at radison blu plaza xing guo hotel this week and i was wondering where i can find a dinner place nearby surprisingly when i walked along the road i found this restaurant its very nice decor asian style restaurant and when i went upstairs the decor was amazingly cool i selected ginger tea with honey  the best that ive had and especially good when it was a bit cold last night
i ordered the vietnamese pho and another surprise  the beef was sliced nicely and let me put the beef inside the hot soup and pho noodles myself
i watched next table  ordered the nice soup and sushi another table ordered some appetizer combo and curry looked so yummy next time i should come again with more friends so that i can try more dishes when i left i saw some nice packed candylike sweets and i was told that its the mandarin orange skin specially made and as giveaway so sweet~ thank you, we spend a very nice evening at ginger must be nice when a bit warmer and one could enjoy the terrace food was good and service very attentive will certainly come back, i have been going to ginger for about 6 months now almost monthly and other than a sometimes slow service nothing unusual in shanghai i have always been very impressed with the food variety and quality the value for money is decent but this is not a cheap eatery ginger caters a lot to local expat community and upmarket local residents and it is out of the way of the tourist traps so you get good english language menus and several members of staff to help you order if you dont speak chinese
my only disappointment is the lack of variety of beers the brunch menu could do with some improvement as could the coffee tea selection is great, i have been to ginger by the park a couple of times and i am still undecided about it the setting is great but the quality of the food isnt very consistent and the prices are high for what you get all in all not very memorable, i live not far from this place and pretty often go there for brunchlunch its located in the middle of french concession of course by the park there are two entrances one from the front another one is from the park they have a nice brunch menu around 6 dishes they often change the menu but dishes like shakshuka and pancakes always stay honestly i wish they had more options
the only thing that dissaponted me is that they dont have any smoothies without yogurt
rather than that everything was pretty nice its a great place to bring your friends or family for a nice brunch or lunch
also they sell amazing fig chutney 58 rmb ginger jam 58 rmb and ginger cookies 18rmb on the 1st floor, nicely located in the french concession area with a 2nd floor outdoor seating ginger offers very tasty thaifusion food my favorite dish is athai flavored salmon pasta  salad, nice people great food all alone and yet made many friend this is a great place to to once you are finished with chinese food from local places and want to experiment, ginger at the park is a great place to go for lunch with friends or for dinner with the 2 of you or some more people of course
the food is very tasty and surprising the crab cakes are great
there is an outdoor terrace on the first floor not very big but very cosy and surrounded by trees to really give you a park feeling if the weather is too cold inside is very cosy too, from the outside the restaurant looks small but they have used the space well and have even created an outside seating area which is lovely especially at night with the candle lit tables
menu is varied and all food is very well presented and very tasty with prices being good value
we will return if we go back to shanghai, i am surprised by the great reviews people are leaving for this establishment

we arrived at the restaurant and at first we thought it has closed down the front facade on one side is chained up and shuttered behind the glass front then we realized there is another side to the place and we climbed up the narrow stairs it is at best an average looking place

the foods we got were truly low grade what they call the red jewel beetroot appetizer was the most unappetizing mushy possibly out of the can thin layer of something with kids level decoration of yoghurt on top of it i was embarrassed

they brought out the beef pho and i thought what the pho what is this it looked bad and it tasted bad noodle portion was average beef portion was great if you are an 18 month old kid and the taste was undeniably poor by any standard if vietnam finds out they are selling that dish under the name of pho war will break out and they will fight with last man standing fever

the spiced lamb meatballs was a disappointment ground meat of poor taste sitting on tahini which no one ate

asian style crap cakes are called asian style crab cakes on their menu the detox vegetable soup was bad and our guests did not eat it apparently you need to be high on drugs to order that detox soup

the shoga salad was their best offering mentaiko spaghettini had an ok taste but it was full of msg the supplier puts high doses of msg in the codfish roe this is not the restaurants doing my wife ordered the phat thai and she found the food to be of poor quality she did not finish it she complained of the taste our guest ordered the smoked norwegian salmon confit i asked how was her food and she replied it is ok though the portion was small she left some of it and combined with her reply of it is ok i knew that dish did not impress

their mango sago desert was very tasty and very  small the chocolate cake was strong

and of their service i must say they are fast way too fast before we were able to finish our appetizer the main course arrived and they start to clear the appetizer i was happy to see that red jewel away from me but my guests had only just begun to enjoy their appetizers and salad

i think this is where the fault lies there is no real identity to this bistro except that it is by a park the chef cannot be churning out great vietnamese food and thai food and indian food and seafood and deserts and burger and so onthey will do better if they can learn to do one cuisine well

i spent over one thousand rmb and bought myself a whole lot of embarrassment

on the way out the waitress refused my amex card and says visa only i nearly fainted i did not have a visa card and not enough rmb in my pocket i did not want to go to my wife and ask for money so i decided to double check sorry why do you not accept mastercard she answers oh mastercard is ok crazy girl why do you then say visa only

i generously give this restaurant a two star rating because their location is in a nice setting not awesome and the food was just eatable not great by any measure otherwise theyd be down to the minimum rating, this was the first time that i went to that part of the french concessions and it was delightful the restaurant is located in a very quiet area and surrounded by old buildings and trees we sat outside on the first floor terrace enjoying our afternoon there its a bit a shame that they didnt serve afternoon tea set during holiday but the cake and lemon tart we finally chose with mango smoothies were really tasty and refreshing a very relaxing moment

staff was very nice in helping me to bring my sons stroller to the first floor restaurant is located 10 min walk from jiaotong university metro station so easily accessible we will probably be back again when the weather permits outdoor sitting, although the restaurant is located quite in the centre of shanghai it is in a quote location sitting there in the evening under huge plate trees platanus and facing a byside park trees i had a feeling that i am sitting in a forest  a feeling not to be beaten in shanghai
food was absolutely delicious tasty nice served first class selection of wines was also great
it is a kind of boutique bar  bistro if you are ready to stay in nice place but not the cheapest it is definately worth to spend an evening here will surely be back, at rmb148 with no tax or service charge i had a very full  satisfying meal i eat a lot

the weekend brunch set consists of 1 appetizers with 5 minis 2 main 3 dessert especially loved the crispy rice appetizers and the choc cake dessert mains of course i chose the black rice

it sounds expensive when you look at the price and after trying it with the quality i was glad i gave myself a treat, my husband and i moved to shanghai a month ago and were referred to ginger for their delicious ginger mojitos and great food ginger did not disappoint in fact we have been there twice now the beef curry is delish as is the pho  spring rolls when you walk in the smell of ginger gives you a sense of relaxation and seating upstairs is great there is no doubt we will be back many times in the future, we have visited ginger several times and love their menu and their drinks in particular their ginger mojitos last week we were very disappointed with the service and the attitude of the new manageress whilst the service is often a little slow our last visit was unacceptable my friends salmon dish was raw and frozen in the middle when she complained she was told this was the way it was meant to be and it was too bad if she didnt like it she sent the dish back and ordered another one which took 20 minutes to arrive when the bill came she was charged the full price when she complained the new manageress told her that she had already apologised and that should be enough luckily another member of staff came and took the item off the bill it was extremely disappointing service and it is unlikely we will return to ginger anytime soon, small bistros such as this are not hard to find but its when they remember you and they start to anticipate what youre likely to have that they begin to grow on you yes ok i did complain on my first visit that the mojito was too small at the price not only did they take that away and get me a bigger one but the next time they remembered me and my mojito
the ownermanager can be seen around the place all the time and shes trying lots of different things on the cuisine front so recently the beef curry has featured  it must be the best in town
the entrance to this place is deceptivego in and head upstairs the verandah looking out on the park is absolutely unique and worth just stopping by for a drink, ginger by the park is one of the most welcoming places i have ever seen you immediately feel like home food drinks decor music all is perfectly set up and with the view and several levels all slightly differently everyone finds a cozy corner to relax and enjoy
the crowd is mixed from all over the world and everyone seems to enjoy the perfect place after a hectic day in shanghai to end the day
this my top of the list in this city, was there for dinner with colleagues the place has both indoor and outdoor settings very good service food was great we requested recommendations from the bartender definitely worth a try, very charming bistro next to the radisson hotel in the french concession great view from the second floor on the adjacent park nice terrace very nice interiors food is mostly south asian with a touch of modernity and executed perfectly a special mention for the ricota pancakes the waguy burger and the fresh juices, a really comfortable place in the french concession great for a lunch and a bottle of vino they have a patio but the weather was not quite nice enough to experience it, ginger by the park is one of my favorite lunch place nice terrace by summer and warm and cosy inside overlooking the park on cold and rainy days
my absolute favorite drink is the lemongrass tea cold or hot and my favorite dishes are malay beef curry or chicken tajine with mezze mix to start and great lemon tart at the end
love it, we went to ginger for its convenience we were flying back to the states later that day and wanted a good brunch to hold us for hours most places dont open until 11 or 12 but ginger could take us at 10am allowing us enough time to make our flight the three of us split several brunch items after ordering ginger tea you must eggs with mushrooms i can still taste the shrooms ricotta pancakes that were light as a feather and savory at the same time and a tasty corn fritter the other egg dish was less memorable but the ginger takeaways candied ginger and ginger jam are well worth making room in your suitcase for or at least we did, we went to ginger for a late meal after the acrobatics show because of the late hour the service was a little rushed but the food we had was all very delicious i had the vegetarian detox soup which was very tasty  seems to be mostly spinach but was ver green in any case my wife had the pumpkin croquettes to start and my daughters the falafel all reported satisfaction

i had the vegetarian curry for dinner another detox that was superb mostly cauliflower and broccoli  and the gravy was delicious i meant to have black or brown rice but forgot and was not asked  wife had the corn fritter appetizer as a main and daughters the chicken which was all very delicious the dessert of the brownie and the carrot cake were sensational  decadent but not huge portions

it is clear that the chef here cares very much about the cuisine the menu has a wide variety of dishes to suit any palette  so enjoy, ginger by the park is our favorite weekend lunch place most times oftener year we enjoy sitting at the nice terrace on cold and rainy days we enjoy the warm and cosy part of the restaurant
i dont remember the dish name but my absolute favorite dish is a minced meat dish where you wrap the meat in lettuce leafs this dish is a must when visiting this restaurant, finally had dinner here last night it was a quiet sunday and we pretty much managed to have the restaurant to ourselves its a pity that we couldnt do al fresco seating since shanghai is heading into winter very nice patio by the park which will be really nice on a warm day we had the homemade tofu laksa black fried rice and homemade ginger ale for rmb 330 the homeade tofu tasted blendi guess this is how healthy food tastes like the laksa had the kick and the friend rice was average service was good only thing i didnt like was the fact we were seated too closely to the restrooms its the design of the second floor as some of the seatings are rather near the restroom, went there for lunch with my wife great placejust a bit out of prime location if you will get your breath out by climbing stairs dont go  the terrace in good given the air quality and weather is ok
food quality is good they do not accept american express or discovery cards well only visa i think
the staff are friendly the south east asian dishes are pretty god there laksa etc the ginger tea is great as well

198,"bottega serves pretty good clay oven pizzas for the area i dropped in for a takeaway and the waitstaff were quite helpful providing me with a menu and suggesting fan favorites i ordered the spicy pie with sausage the pizza was not too crispy yet not too softjust right and quite flavorful i would definitely return if i want a decent pizza, we sat outside and drank wine with a couple of starters those being bruschetta with smoked salmon and a mozzarella sampler plate the location was great for enjoying a beautiful shanghai spring day talking and peoplewatching the red wine was very nice nero davalo as was the food with only the cheese possibly needing a bit of additional flavor along with the friendly service we will definitely stop here again when in the xintiandi area, kind of pricy for what you get but it was a nice spot for a break we had a couple good pizzas and drinks  wound up at 335 rmb so expensive lunch but its a pricey area, one of the best pizza in shanghai the pizza is almost perfect little bit less oil and was perfect fresh mozzarellastaff friendly
i nice place in xintiandi, had a very bad experience for the food  quantity of spinach salad very poor its not fresh at all and we have order bruschetta and bread is fried and too oily had a very bad experience, bottega makes excellent mozzarella and other related cheeses like trette and straciatella if you are lucky enough to be there on a nice day sitting outside is a treat crowd watching other visitors to xintiandi

if it isnt nice outside the clean simple decor of the restaurant is totally satisfying to have a great afternoon meal, amazing dishes around mozzarella and various types of italian cheeses the pancettamushroom bruschetta is a must try 
thank you to geoffrey for the nice service and good time , very good and quick service france friend geoffrey very helpful to choose with a perfect recommendations  just explaining your expectations and preferences mozzarella plate with different kinds are excellent breads are hot and vines are tasty definitely recommend with a good price level, great casual restaurant superb location in the hearth f xintiandi and one of the best pizza in town a little bit more of cheese on it and it would be perfect
the burrata is amazing a must try
enjoy, we were walking in the area on our first night in shanghai and saw this restaurant the menu somewhat reminded us of milan so we went in

good staff helped us decide what to order

we selected a cheese plate  burrata etc but the real highlight was a pizza bianco  a white pizza with mozzarella gorgonzola hazelnuts pear and more wash it down with a moretti beer  worked well for me, a frenchman by the name of geoffrey welcomed and made us feel at home the menu is simple italian cuisine centered around homemade mozzarella stracciatella bocconcini burrata and pizza we choose pasta and a stracciatella and a green salad as an entree you cant get better pasta even in italy service was friendly, in the famous renovated or rebuilt better said very fashioned neighbourhood of xintiandi in the french concession you will have the choice among tenth of bars small food services and more classy restaurants
bottega is a not pretentious pizzeria and italian pasta restaurant i choose a classic napolitana pizza really very very good in quality as in quantity just with sparkling water lunch obliged but with a excelent espresso
very gentle staff quick service smiles and good food  at a relatively good price less than 30 us dolars knowing the very trendy place it is not so bad and i would advise you to taste, super friendly staff and the pizzas are gorgeous you do not get them better in italy they need to put sambucca on their list though, a pizza isnt just a pizza until youve had one at bottega  delicious crust and sauce and a good wine list and cocktail list to boot pastas are also fab great spot for peoplewatching in xintiandi and a good value overall service was quite good for such a busy spot in xintiandi, they have free wifi which is great for tourists wandering around xintiandi initially we stumbled upon this place because we saw there were a good mix of locals and westerners sitting there must be good food and we were right everything we ordered on the menu was made fresh and we were certainly very happy to have good quality italian food, just dropped in for a light lucy pleasantly surprised with the quality of food loved it
toilets are clean and the service is great, nice restaurant in xintiandi
pizza is good even if not the best and selection of flavors is good
normal service, bottega does serve pizza and has a mozzarella bar but we stopped by for drinks all of their cocktails where great and the atmosphere was nice be aware this is a more expensive restaurant but its not too bad if you compare it to similar foreign establishments, the spicy 7 pizza is definitely spicy especially if you get a mouthful of the red chinese chili pepper slices bidden amongst the other yummy ingredients the beer they have on draught to firefight the spiciness was chimay gold which combined with the neapolitan thin crust oven fired pizza

a little on the pricier side for pizza but youre helping subsidize the prime xintiandi location if its a sunny day and you can grab an outside table then it will be close to worth it, the pizzas are very very small compared with the price
the drinks are overpriced
worst of the worst they dont open the water bottle in front of you and they ask you to trust them that this is really bottled water when they give you the bill you are in china dont trust them, authentic and tasty well presented excellent bruschetta delicious caprese salad light and tasty pizza service was fast but perhaps due to lack of confidence in language a bit silent would go again for the food, the mozzarella and the bruschetta was really good i did enjoy the pizza as well the service in it self wasnt super but with in the good avarage i will definitely go back, i was there for a few dinner and found the place very nice a lot a other italian around but not serving this quality service was ok but need to improve especially with the competition around a place to try, we felt like we were inconveniencing the staff three of them were standing in the doorway chatting and called them over after about 10 mins when the guy took our order we apologised for disturbing him

the pizza had more dough than a cake factory we were looking for the ingredients amongst the dough we thought it was just us and looked around at the other tables and others seem to have this dough problem others had left lumps of dough on their plates

we would have liked to have given feedback to the chef but really didnt feel that we were able to do so so overall a terrible evening out and a bloated stomach full of dough, was in xintiandi for business and wanted to have a quick dinner before heading back to the hotel chose for bottega as it was mostly empty for a reason i guess pasta was overseasoned expensive but small portion service very distant had to call several times to get waiters doing their job cutlery comes with the dish and a wrinkled napkin very cheap no water no bread guess i chose the worse restaurant in xintiandi which also happened to be the only empty one  i should have known better , of course the restaurant is in a very busy and touristic neighbourhood but theres a reason for the popularity its a nice and beautiful scenery there and theres a great choice of cuisines and restaurants we were in the mood for italian food very pleased with our decision great starters over all good food, several time i been in this place better say weekly and this is the single italian place where im coming back with very pleasure
good service and good food burrata home made cold cuts cheese pizza and my favorite wine marco felluga
i will be back again and again , not bad but nothing to write home about certainly a safe choice in a foreign land

signature mozzarella was a bit on the tough side but accompanying pesto geeks tomatoes were nice had to ask for bread though it was on the menu as included with cheese it was stale

bolognese pasta was good cooked just right sauce not bad

dinner with 2 glasses of wine plus coffee was <u+00a5>400 a bit steep, right in the middle of xintiandi this bright mozzarella restaurant looks very good
pizza is good and also mozzarella
owner is friendly and also service is ok
food is made of high quality raw materials and you can taste it
overal a bit overpriced, weve eaten here two times now and had very good meals both times each time weve come with 6+ people and ordered cheese for an appetizer drinks and pizzas and a few people ordered pasta dishes and spent between 250 to 300 cny per person this is fairly standard in xintiandi and at similar caliber restaurants throughout the city the service was good especially by shanghai standards and considering our large group
the stracciatella burrata and regular mozzarella were all delicious and we all enjoyed trying and comparing the different varieties the burrata comes out like a bun it has a thin skin and is filled with creamy cheese in the middle we loved it we like the cheeses with the balsamic vinegar and the pesto they are also great on the foccacia
the pizzas have an ample amount of cheese the pizza with salame was a big hit with the guys in our group the margherita was also delicious be aware that if you are ordering multiple pizzas they wont all come out at once but over a span of maybe 15 minutes for 6 pizzas on our last trip
overall great mozzarellas and pizza but be prepared to spend some money, for me this is a kind of restaurant for neither lunch or dinner but something in between at least if you are a westerner and used to larger portion
ah the portions� small and insufficient by european italian maybe enough for chinese the whole experience is rather overpriced so i think the owner should really look at this and don�t assume that we are all affluent chinese with pockets full of cash as reference for a light bite we are talking some 350 rmb per person all together
on the upper the quality of the food is very good and the mozzarellas are homeproduced by the italian owner�s husband with his own cows i recommend the �bufala� over the simpler normal mozzarella
i like the concept and what they have on offer and appreciate the effort in offering something with original taste i will give 4stars with this in consideration
still�portions are very small, you cant have very high expectation when it comes to food in shanghai china but this place which is relatively new has very good pizza i had just the margaritta pizza and it was quite good fresh mozzarella and great crust the caprese salad was also very fresh and tasty definitely recommend the place however it is in a touristy area, this was just across the street from the langham hotel in a complex of restaurants and a few shops i needed a little pizza break after two weeks in asia it wasnt bad for a brick oven pizza maybe a little soft crust wise but it was cooked enough to brown and melt the cheese this is china not italy or new york so manage your expectations accordingly they don�t take amex, wow a friend told me about this new restaurant and said it was excellent she was definitely correct a friend ordered the margherita pizza and i ordered the rigatoni with basil dish outstanding for both meals the taste of the food is phenomenal when my husband returns from a business trip this is one of the first places we will go out tohighly recommend, this restaurant is in xintiandi area you can dine alfresco and enjoy looking at the people outside food itself would not be bad but what really pissed you off is the extremely bad service the waiters that are not cleaning the table and if you call them they do not care we wait for more than 30 minutes to get two pizza price level is crazy for what you get 4 slices of san daniele ham for 58 rmb there are way better italian restaurant in shanghai, walked in with no expectations and walked out with no memories
mozzarella is good but crazy expensive 3 thin slices of san daniele at 128 rmb you pay 28 rmb for 3 burnt pieces of focaccia in a place like this they should serve it as default","Jazz bar",0.614884950791193

2,"i visited this restaurant last friday and my world about this place is perfect  super friendly service since even before entering the restaurant  i placed us in the best table  was with the pear tower beside me  the attendant steven speck perfect enghlis and treated us wonderfully  the sparkling wine was on ideal temperature  our perfect entries lobster bisque for me and mozzarella burrata  the wonderful main dish  toscana pasta and ossobuco with parmesan risotto  my mention with the mix of divine desserts my favorite tiramisu definitely the best restaurant in shanghai  would return every day , the views from this restaurant are amazing i just had soup and salad which for the price really was just ok members of my dinner party tried other dishes and absolutely raved about the quality and taste steak, i visited this restaurant 4 months ago for celebration of my husbands bday all staffs were very kind and educated they knew exactly what the customer wants food was great and view was amazing eventhough the price is relatively higher than other restaurants in shanghai it was valuable ill visit scena again in next trip to shanghai

special thanks to sky who served us, i dont usually write restaurant reviews but ive had such a positive experience at scena italian that i just feel like sharing

first of all the view is to die for we were there for dinner early march and its still way to cold to sit out in the rooftop restaurant here we were able to enjoy our dinner with the unobstructed view of oriental pearl tower safe from the weather element it felt nothing short of magical

secondly the food was very tasty and serving quite generous there were loads of truffles in our mushroom soup and the prosciutto with melon was gigantic as an appetizer the main course pasta  ravioli was also good but the desserts are even better beautifully presented as well

last but not the least the service was impeccable we were there with my 4 year old boy who was absolutely exhausted from a whole day of sightseeing our server betty was beyond attentive gave him lots of table activities to occupy him and went so far as putting two chairs together and made a little makeshift bed for him to snooze in leaving us to enjoy the evening which would have otherwise been cut short for this im very very grateful i can honestly say that the service i received here has been nothing but exceptional for anyone visiting shanghai i thoroughly recommend this place thanks to betty for a wonderful evening well always remember, centrally located and close to all the leading premium mall and financial business centre very close to all the tourist attraction of pudong area at a walkable distance, i was with my friend to have dinner in scena
the restaurant is decorated decantly with a taste of elegance with nice view over huangpu river and oriental tower the restaurant is wellpositioned to have the best view in shanghai however the most surprising is the widerange food they porovide  and the food are both delicious and welldisplayed the seafood soap and spaghetti are of both tasty and high quality by far the best itilian food i tried in shanghai

besides the restaurant manager molly are of extremely helpful and professional showing her eagerness to make us feel good  by introducing the best food offered by scena we felt that molly do have good knowledge in introducing every small details of the restaurant and the food she is very helpful by far the most impressive staff we met in ritz carlton were very lucky to be there for dinner

besides weve been in aura for good drinking as well

for sure its a nice dinner and thanks to molly and her team

best regards 
joe, quiet atmosphere spectacular view manager was very polite ad came to check on us waiters did a great job got a complementary birthday cake food was on point, i didnt book for scena but was accommodated on a quiet sunday evening

the menu is filled with delicious choices priced fairly for the quality youre getting

service was second to none prompt and respectful

i was a little annoyeddisappointed by the random 15 surcharge that was added to my bill at the end of the night  it wasnt a public holidayspecial circumstancecorkage i didnt fight it because it wasnt too substantial for a solo diner but be warned it may be hefty if you splurge

the view is phenomenal  i avoided the 2 hour wait for the oriental pearl tower and to be honest i think i got a calmer better experience  particularly given the pollution can hinder the views most nights, i booked a table for 2 on 26th feb 2017 it was my girlfriends birthday so i decided to try this restaurant as a birthday treat i rang through a couple days in advance for the booking requesting a window table the lady i spoke to was very nice and asked some very thoughtful questions which was a good sign of the service we were to receive

on the day we arrived and was greeted by a receptionist who took us to our table we had a great view of the pearl tower and our table area felt like a private room the staff were all very polite and our waitress provided some recommendations on the menu we decided to go for the set family set menu which was supposed to be for 2ppl but we struggled to finish it but was great to be able to sample many different dishes the cod and the desserts was the highlights at the end of our meal the waitress brought out a ice cream pastry dessert with a candle and happy birthday message this was totally unexpected but was a very classy touch to end a great evening

i would recommend this restaurant for the great view and service we have had better italian food elsewhere but it was still of a good quality this is the only reason why i did not give 5 stars, this italian restaurant has one spectacular positivethe view from its 52nd floor location the food was good but not worthy of a fivestar rating our server took the orders for appetizers and then basically disappeared we actually had to have another staff person find her she came back with apologies which was mitigated by the nice dinner conversation i think she must have put a rush on our order as the entrees arrived in no time she came back and offered dessert to us which was a nice gesture however i did not go with the expectation of free dessertsi wanted a fivestar meal served with fivestar service in a fivestar setting thats what i think a fivestar rating means once the desserts were finished we once again had an issue with our absent server we once again had to have someone find her she apologized about a large party but thats not really a valid enough reason for poorlack of service each diner should be afforded the same great service the bill was certainly reflective of a highend dining establishment unfortunately the food and service did not match, if you love a meal with a view try this one you cant beat the view on the pearl tower good italian food as well with nice fresh ingredients i had the pleasure to stay at the hotel and also enjoy scena for a generous breakfast very good for diner during summer start with a drink on the top floor bar and watch the sunset on the city, my husband and i had an amazing evening at the restaurant scena the view is spectacular which helps create the very special ambiance delightful is hardly the best word to describe the food it was more than delicious the staff could not have been more attentive and friendly we felt like we were the only ones in the waiting room to top it off we met the most adorable restaurant manager micro he took the time to get to know us make recommendations and even let us in on a special dessert drink he took us up to see their lovely bar on the rooftop and accompanied us to the exit what a perfect evening, had a set 4 course meal food was avarge appart from the main dish which was a lovely perfectly cooked cod the breathtaking view plus child friendly place pluss the excellent service saved the night would expect a lot more food wise especially taking into account the high price level, great food and super view i really like the place
i will say i think you pay a fair price for the food it is a bit pricy for what it is but really good a pasta is around 200250rmb but its okay cause you do get a really fantastic view if you have a window table
but i honestly think the drinks are way to overpriced and therefor i can only give it 4 out of 5 a 330ml bottle beer is 78rmb + 15 service charge all other restaurant you will get a draught 500ml for around ~60rmb +15 service charge
so this is the only minus i would say else a really nice restaurant great service i special thanks to betty she was our waiter that night great girl lovey smile and very good attitude

so overall 4 out of 5 with the price of drinks i cant give it 5 stars, superb service every person i came in contact with had my comfort and satisfaction as their highest priority i really cannot adequately compliment their exceptional service it was really beyond what i have had at any restaurant it seems very genuine and sincere johnny in particular made sure i had an amazing experience here i also really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant my favorite meal in shanghai was their black cod with mediterranean sauce the views are the best of any restaurant i have seen in the world i ate here twice and tonight my last night in shanghai i might go again, just finished a solo dinner at scena as my wife fell ill with a fever today arrived when dinner opened 530 and was seated at a table with a view to die for then my server betty arrived and couldnt be nicer while the food choices are on the overpriced side my alacarte pasta dish was nearly 30 usd the service and extras made it worth it betty brought me a glass of champagne a nice cured meat appetizer and then a lovely ice cream desert all compliments of the restaurant the breads and rolls were also fresh and good so while this isnt a bargain meal taking into consideration the ambience service views and extras i was happy to pay $48 including builtin gratuity this after all the topranked ritz carlton and scena is a signature restaurant on the 52nd floor i wasnt even staying at the hotel and loved my visit world class in every way, scena is and can only be understood as a ritzcarlton restaurant the incredible service reputation that the hotel brand carries over to scena here is what happened when my girlfriend and i went

we had no reservation for jin xuan on the 53rd floor the hostess at jin xuan took our names and recommended we try scena on the 52nd with no reservation they asked our names and sat us at a table with a view of pearl tower on the bund

we had a wonderful conversation with the gentleman who served us who ended up being the manager when my girlfriend complimented the chef he brought the chef out to meet us he did this a second time unexpectedly at the end of our meal

they complimented us with free glasses of champagne and at the end of our meal spiced wine at the end of the meal they had also removed $200 worth of food from our $300 bill when i asked the waitress why she replied that they just enjoyed having us and wanted to wish a safe journey home to the us we had not complained about anything nor suggested we wanted anything comped

we had six separate courses and dined for 2h30mins beginning with cured meats appetizers soup pasta grill entrees and dessert along with free dinner breads throughout the meal each course was excellently prepared flavorful and beautiful to look at individual portions are small but by the end of a full set meal you are more than satisfied with how fed you are i have eaten at numerous fine restarsunts and even still this food was comparably exceptional

the atmosphere is wonderful it has a unique view of the bund that cannot be challenged except by the other three restaurants in the same ritzcarlton hotel the artdeco style is quintessentially ritz and you feel both calm and fascinated while sitting in the restaurant your eyes wander from the chefs to the city to the grand piano and wine displays it has everything

you must go to this restaurant and do it right plan to stay for a long time and eat an entire set, stopped here for an afternoon supper loved the pasta authentic al dente way attentive service and nice atmosphere the restaurant seemed very cozy and comfortable good experience , this is the place for great variety of foods and a good time the prices are pretty ok for shanghai you do get amazing views and a great staff, exelent service exelent food exelent champagne and exelent view this is a perfect hotell and with lots of nice and cozy restaurants so i think this will be our choise also next time in shanghai, the restaurant sits high above the skyline and the view is magical the food was ok but overpriced too touristy for my taste we were disappointed, excellent service at this fine restaurant you will find couples enjoying a romantic evening over seeing the great view of the band from a very high view point yet the place is also good for business dinners

i tried the truffle menu with 4 courses and its a really good deal considering dining in a 5 star hotel restaurant

will definitely revisit again in the future, our first evening in the city we decided to treat ourselves to a wonderful meal in a premier setting on the fiftysecond floor not only had we superlative food but also thrilling views of the sparkling city lights

we opted for the truffle menu with the recommended accompanying wines with each of the courses including dessert the truffle waitress arrived with the precious fare and slivered about a gram around the dish all were delicious

the decor was pleasing rich colour tones and unobtrusive we considered the staff great very amiable and helpful

it was a most pleasant and relaxing time, this is the great italian restaurant in shanghai and i had the great dinner over there when i made reservation i did request the birthday cake to be provided during the dinner they are very kind to provide free cake to me as well as the whole night they provided excellent service
i ordered the set meal for two cost me cny 1900 including tax and its worth to pay for that
the portion is at right size and taste is good especially the steak is so yummy , very nice and reasonable priced business set menu for a high end restaurant
dont hesitate to ask for favorites directly to the chef
you can take your business partners with confidence
dont expect a cheap deal for dinner though, the service is very good as the staff is very friendly and approachable the food is very delicious and it is the best meal i had during my trip the table they had reserved for me has great view, although a little expensive the views are so worth it there are tables outside on the terrace as well as in the bar restaurant itself our meal was very nicely prepared and presented and the choice of drinks was first class, amazing view and an amazing buffet of appetizers and desserts to accompany main dishes to order my pumpkin risotto with white fish was excellent, we drove our way to to scena to have dinner at this top rated restaurant well i could say and my friends mostly agree service was friendly and food was ok but we had similar and sometimes even better italian food in town at more reasonable rates so we left the place a bit underwhelmed, this is my first time went to shanghai with my husband on business trip and we stayed at ritz carlton we got a free breakfast at scena located on 52nd floor so you can imagine the amazing view to pearl tower the river and across to bund in the morning the staffs are very catering to our needs they remember my routine and bring them to my table this is really five star with concierge service for examples i like decaf coffee pancake the best pancake ive ever had with banana sauce longan fruits so they served me with these yummy food everyday they also let me take left over food to my room with a nice container and paper bag its just like you buy these food from store
breakfast contents are pretty complete they have everything its like brunch my favorite food is pork jelly made from lean meat i can say lean meat because i dont get headache
one of the staff her name is parissa she is a very nice girl hard worker always smile trying to serve me and other guests the best she also gave me souvenirs a neck pillow from ritz carlton
over all i love all ritz carlton ive been in other ritz carlton such as in san francisco and half moon bay and my favorite is the one in pudong the room is big luxurious new with a bath tub shower and again fantastic scenery to the city
i will certainly come back again here and tell my friends about ritz so every one can enjoy their awesome hospitality, stopped at scena for lunch and found they were serving sunday brunch what a treat the buffet was very nicely appointed and featured many outstanding choices delicious desserts the service was very good and the chef daniele personally came to our table when the staff learned it was our 12th anniversary what a nice man so helpful with other dining suggestions in shanghai overall a great experience, in visiting this restaurant you should be aware that you are paying for the best view of shanghai at night and that you will receive impeccable service is that worth $200person you decide the food was remarkably mediocre my companion and i had the chefs tasting menu starters were goodspecialunusual pasta was only ok steak was fatty and nearly impossible to cut fish was cooked perfectly but flavorless sides were lukewarm and not good at all dessert sampler was great we went to the rcs rooftop bar flair ahead of dinner and in retrospect i would have just gone there and had appetizers and drinks and enjoyed the same view, i have been there two time for dinner we always get a very private and cozy corner no people around you you feel like you have your own room

from ordering wine to food we always get good recommendation  timing between starter to main courses was reasonable around 10 minutes after the starter, this restaurant sums it all great view and great food as well as great service
having that magnificent view was a plus, i recently was in shanghai on a business trip and was fortunate to be able to eat breakfast at scena every morning they have a wide variety of food to choose from chinese and western choices are available but what really made my morning wonderful was the staff there each morning i was greeted very warmly and brought to the best seat available usually by the window to enjoy to view of the pearl tower and surrounding area ada was there most days to welcome me to the restaurant with a terrific smile and would check on me to make sure that i was not missing anything her colleague with a similar name oda would also check that i had the orange juice that i would want every morning and help to clear my used plates promptly tracy would make the waffles and pancakes almost every morning and would make fresh ones if i was a little late everyone at scena was very friendly and helpful it was a pleasure to go to breakfast there every morning to see and talk with ada oda and tracy as well as the rest of the staff though i have not learned everyones name yet i look forward to my next visit to scena and their welcoming smiles and greatly appreciate that they remember me and address me by name, what a let down  we booked scena for my friends promotion celebration due to its fantastic reviews i have been many fine dining restaurants in different cities in the world and though the bill was one of the highest i paid in shanghai unfortunately scena did not meet with our high expectations  even the pizza we had was less than ordinary the ingredients were not at high quality which one should expect especially at a no 1 restaurant with full of good reviews at ritz the starters were just ok the temperature of the steak came wrong though we stated it as medium rare both in english and chinese while ordering, dont get me wrong the staff and the service were wonderful but we couldnt wait to get to a mcdonalds clearly the chef does not know how to cook american food we tried a number of things angus ribeye risotto salad cheese spread etc and nothing was even remotely good the bill was $257 and we felt like we got robbed excellent view excellent service horrendous food food was bland improperly cooked small portioned overpriced and flat out bad, the view in this place is just simply breathtaking its not cheap but well worth it the food is excellent and their special all inclusive menu is very good and reasonably priced, i cannot say enough good things about the service at scena truly topnotch from the daisy the hostess to who greeted us to johnny the manager to betty our server and summer the bartender in the adjoining jazz bar the service was warm friendly accomodating and genuine the food was delicious but it was the service that made for a lovely evening the wine list is extensive and very impressive i would highly recommend the lobster bisque but be forewarned that this is not your typical cream based bisque the seafood linguini was excellent and my friend who had the steak who considers himself a steak connoisseur said it was and excellent cut of meat and one of the most flavorful steak hes ever had you must save room for dessert as the tiramisu is an experience unto itself a large sphere of what looks like marble appears at the table and it literally melts to expose coffee ice cream and the tiramisu as the server pours hot chocolate sauce over it while fun to watch its even better to eat my friend and i wanted to enjoy the view of the city while in town and have a memorable meal and scena was the perfect choice, i decided to invite my friends for memorable dinner follows by lounge atmosphere to chill out and to be able to hear each other that will automatically says lets go to scena and flair as they have it all right up there so we went out there last week we had amazing time however we all believed that the atmosphere food quality and service touch played it all

their service flow very consistence and sharp specially when it comes to timing and eye for details food played also big role as honestly speaking was the time that you dont want your dish to finish because it is so good but not only taste but also the presentation clean cut

music was just perfect that you dont feel it as goes well with the atmosphere and the restaurant dna

lighting was super classy and well balanced that gives you relaxing luxury feel

the view is wow but honestly speaking to team there takes over the view as they do better wow facts for you starting from the table top followed by the beautiful breadbasket clean cut starters well presented hot main courses and the unforgettable dessert

great place for friends and family get together also great place to impress someone

best personal regards, regular business breakfast haunt for me the menu and buffet are topquality and varied  however the staff is outstanding cannot say enough about how professional and friendly everyone is in this resto

dining room is odd some of the tables are too tight or jumbled together

it is busy and hectic but one can engage w dining colleagues and be heard above the din

have dined there for dinner once or twice over the years  its fine in a pinch however there are other options in the ritz carlton or elsewhere in the neighbourhood

reliable and dependable for breakfast, excellent food service view and taste we had delicious lobster bisque risotto and the best tiramisu not the regular tiramisu but the best, after a week of local chinese dining we were craving western food  last night we ate at m on the bund which was also incredible and tonight it was time for scena scena took the lead by far may have been one of the best meals ive had in a long time we went all out
the lobster bisque was to die for
the basil risotto was light fresh and yet full of tasty indulgence
the cod had a very refined wonderful taste although not a choice i would go for again only because the risotto was much more incredible
my dad had the pigeon and also found it delicious
overall the presentation of the food in addition the wonderful service english speakers at last created a beautiful ambiance with the exceptional shanghai view
then the desserts came out i wouldnt recommend the almond curd the tiramisu is a must trust me experience it yourself
oh and of course the double espresso spot on, definitely one of best restaurants in shanghai food and service were impeccable besides this you have one of most stunishing views of pearl tower on 52 floor on ritz carlton hotel expensive but worth it, i have been dining in scena restaurant few times over my 2 years of living in shanghai and beside the beautiful view from a huge ceiling window nice design of the open kitchen and the impeccable ritz carlton luxury service offer the most important key of success for this restaurant its their people
starting from the chef de cuisine  restaurant manager which i am pretty sure they are italian judging from their unique italian style charm to the waitress staff and all the chefscooks behind the busy kitchen area the food and service were always precised balanced accurated and unique
please keep up the momentum and i am sure that the number 1 ranking will lasting for a long time
bravo to all, we had a wonderful lunch here with delicious food and nice ambience we feel cozy and relax in the restaurant thanks to kathy and leona for their help and services they make the ritzcarlton become the ritzcarlton, amazing view food also is great tried the lobster pizza was really nice the staff are really helpful and very professional, my husband and i were seated by the window where you get a perfect view of the skyline

the menu is based around italian dishes i ordered the lobster pasta and my husband ordered the truffle promotion

the lobster was so so delicious and i loved the way they ask how you would like your pasta cooked even though i believe all pasta should be al dente i wouldve liked more of a larger portion of pasta but you usually end up with smaller portions in fancy restaurants

my husband got 4 different dishes one of his dishes the pasta meal took a good 30 minutes to come which was annoying pasta doesnt take long to cook at all he also asked for his lamb to be cooked medium rare but it came rare and extremely bloody this is not how a restaurant should operate especially when things are specified

a normal still water costs a crazy amount around 110yuan just for average tasting waster also expect a service charge to be added at the end of your bill too

waitresses were very polite and tried to help as much as possible

i think if the pasta didnt arrive late the lamb was cooked to the desired taste the portion of food was larger and the price of water was reasonably priced then this restaurant would get an excellent rating, scena is simply the best italian restaurant in shanghai

ive been to scena many times in years for lunch or dinner with friends
the past two years i reckon restaurant getting a lot busier definitely picking up good business

each time i always amazed with the food
never got enough
open kitchen is on display for all you are bound to see chef daniele at the pass ensuring every dish that passes meets his high quality standard
chef daniele is determined to wow each diners

lunch is definitely very good value you can have a three course meal at 228 rmb
the price will pay off for taste and quality it is something you will remember and come back for

scena got 3 ultimate reasons to go for heavenly taste food stunning view and good service
what else

simply said scena is not a place that you would go just once, this restaurant has the best views in the city the service was wonderful the food is very good but not the best italian ive had the price was the main drawback you are paying for the views and the great service","dumpling restaurant",0.811176072119532
20,"my hotel is just around the corner so ive been here twice already a mixed plate of 6 delicious dumplings for 16yuan more food than i could eat the lovely chinese group that i shared a table with told me to drink the soup inside first and then eat the dumpling they have an english language menu which makes it easy to order i also ordered beef curry soup on my first visit which was just broth and thinly sliced beef tasty but not as satisfying as the dumplings, we ate in this restaurant twice in a day i would recommend only the fried dumplings in that my order of preference is pork 8rmb shrimp 16rmb and shepherds purse which is pork and greens minced 8rmb i tried pork wanton soup and that was quite bad hardly any filling in the wantons and soup was bland be careful while eating the fried dumplings its filled with hot soup must visit once for sure, clean nuce good service staff
food are delicious i order fishball soup seven up and yang dumpling it costs only cny 21, ive been to this location many times on my last visit i sat and waited what felt like 20 minutes for my dumpling soup the food here is cheap and very tasty and has all the charm of mcdonalds highly recommended for the shrimp dumplings, this dumplings can be found in many places in shanghai but be sure you try in one of this many outlets its fast and delicious to eat the dumplings need a special way so the soup can be enjoyed fully after several attempts youll master the art to eat the dumplings very affordable and popular among local customers, great quick lunch at yangs following a stroll down the bund went for the pork and the prawn dumplings and a pork wonton soup to share between two more than enough dumplings were very tasty with a lovely broth inside and soup was piping hot and flavoursome ridiculously cheap  would highly recommend, and also of broth theyre not easy to eat but theyre so good youll feel highly motivated at this holeinthewall festival of dumplings grab a pile of napkins and throw caution to the wind, i travel to shanghai regularly and never miss a chance to visit on of the many yangs branches or get take away love these dumplings cant decide which is my favourite, if you come to shanghai be sure you dont miss out on sheng jian bao <u+751f><u+714e><u+5305> take my advice make a hole to drink the soup out of the dumplings before taking a bite out of it otherwise you might end up making a big fat mess like i did my first time, popped in for some dumplings  its okay  they are friend vs steamed  i think i prefer the steamed but nice trying the fried to experience and know the difference  small place  walk in order  take a number and sit  very busy w locals which is a good sign , while soup dumplings might be the best shanghai has to offer the fried ones are also well worth a taste they are sharper in their taste and perhaps easier to appreciate

here you need to be observant since they call out your dishes when they are ready and you need to try to remember what your dishes where called acting a bit confused did conjure up some helpfulness in the staff though, loved every bite of it struggled to find it in the first place as its hidden on the second or third floor of a mall  but it was worth it, english speaking staff and english menu were helpful we ordered three different kinds of dumplings it was super cheap and fast great lunch and we brought the leftovers to those who werent able to join us i was surprisingly happy with the vegetable dumplings pork and shrimp were also both tasty, this became the go to breakfast place it served three types of fried dumplings pork  shepherds purse and prawn  the pork ones were our favourite 8 rmb for 4 place is easy to find about 100 m from nanjing road  on the north west side of where nanjing road becomes pedestrianised  simple routine  get english menu from the counter at the front of the store pay then take your till receipt to the counter behind you to the guy who is making the dumplings then go and sit at your table  no waiter service for taking orders  if you order a noodle dish or soup that will be bought to you make sure you pick up a spoon to hold under your dumpling  they are full of soup and hot  you do not want to spill waste the soup  nor will you be able to stuff one whole into your mouth , <u+5c0f><u+694a><u+714e><u+5305>they got many branches around shanghai the quality are pretty similar i used google map to locate the nearest shop the bun base is fried to crispy  very juicy its good for a quick break  snack after the shopping  sightseeing its rather cheap 8 yuan for 4 meat  vegetable bun the shrimp one is slightly expensive value for money

they also have noodle  soup good to try, according to tradition the correct way to eat these dumplings is to poke a small hole in it and suck out the soup before eating the rest of the dumpling however i prefer to stick the whole thing in my mouth and chomp into it carefully as the scalding hot soup is released in a flavour explosion inside your mouth you have to suck in air while holding your head at the correct angle and balancing the dumpling on the inside of your teeth to prevent too much soup from escaping at once and burning your face off it is an incomparable experience of delicousness and survival at once

i have eaten nothing that compares to these every day i ride the subway three stops for lunch have a quick lunch and come back to work the inside of my mouth is a little burnt now but ill be back tomorrow again the rice noodle soup with beef is also delicous if youre not sweating by the time you finish this meal youve done something wrong price for 4 dumplings is 8rmb = about $115 us, one of our main goals while in shanghai was to eat as many xiao long baos we tried so many places including the more well known jia jia right across the street and fuchun xiaolong near the jinan temple and yangs was the best its different than the more traditional dumplings of jia jia in that the skin is thicker and its pan fried we went back almost every day my 1 year old could down 4 dumplings herself must go if you cant read chinese there is english on the pictures along the wall behind the cashier and they have a menu with english its super cheap an order runs about $430 us and comes with 4 dumplings the bottom was fried just right and the soup was slightly thicker than jia jia so it slathered the filling just right with just enough pop, the lady at the cashiers desk handed us an english menu without even asking easy peasy lemon squeezy hands down some of the best dumplings we have tried and the price is right too, these dumplings are sensational try the shrimp but beware if you bite into one without poking it first with your chopstick you will be squirted with hot oil very inexpensive and very filling one order will fill you up, yangs fried dumplings is found in several locations fast food joints with small crowded tables you order and pay upfront collect your food and find a place to sit there is no atmosphere to speak of you just eat and go
we tried the ones at ningbo rd and lujiazui three kinds of dumplingspork shrimp and chives+porkall very good the wonton soup was about average the tasty food makes up for the lack of ambiance, my best lover local shanghainess food is xiaoyang shengjian it is very nice every time i go to shanghai will looking for xiaoyang shen jian every where with wutun soup, fried dumpling is ca pu tuo chinese for not bad
broth noodle taste bad service so so tiny place must share table with other people
no toilet eat n leave visit only u r in neighborhood dont waste time to go there to eat, yangs fried dumplings offer a good option for international visitors to shanghai who want to eat some of the local foods we tried all three but especially loved the veggie dumplings and will be going back for more its a good and very cheap meal the dumplings are filled with hot brine though so be sure to eat them with care, gret cheap dumplings that are found everywhere throughout shanghai ive never had anything like these and i eat alot of dumplings, near nanjing roadarrived around 730 pm last customer 8 dumpling for 32 rmb and 10 for soup a little confused because staff cannot read english and, the fried dumplings are amazing we tried all 3 flavours all very very good
staff doesnt speak any english but the have an english menu, dumplings are perfect i had also a curry noodles soup which was ok but the dumpling are perfect so forget everything else and go for the dumpling, this dumpling restaurant is a great example of classic chinese cooking they serve mostly dumplings here and that is what they are best at the other dishes i was not so keen the dumplings however are superb the super cheap dumplings are truly delicious and leave you full with a smile on your face they are a cheap as 8 rmb 80 pence for 4 dumplings these dumplings are not the usual small ones but large and full of meat or prawn id recommend the 6 pack as you 2 of each type and they truly are heavenly about 1416 rmb 140160 gbp amazingly tasty and cheap the restaurant was clean and did its purpose no glamour but simple you buy and take your receipt to the service window they were quick and adequate, ive read about this place while researching and its included in my to try list before going my cousin specifically texted me to try out this fast food as they have tried it when they went and its a winner for them we usually tried out a place weve read about once then move on to the next one what happened was we had it for breakfast everyday thats how good it was even now i want to go back just to be able to taste the dumplings again, my colleague and i came to shanghai and decided that yangs was on our musttry list we came by on our first night in town but they were sold out and closing for the night the next night we showed up earlier and ordered the sixdumpling sampler plate for 16 yuan roughly $250 usd being in shanghai we had already eaten some excellent xiaolongbao soup dumplings but these are entirely at another level each dumpling has a uniquely spiced flavor and a crispy lightly fried bottom

if you are out on the town and looking for shanghaistyle local food that is delicious and affordable go enjoy yangs fried dumplings, with locations spread all over the city youd be hard pressed not to pass one at least once during your visit to shanghai and visit it you must their consistency amongst all their restaurants is impressive this was our go to place for a quick breakfast every morning fried dumplings and noodle soups were much more appealing to us then the free hotel breakfast also visiting early meant we avoided the crowds the fried dumplings are near perfect fried crispy on one side left doughy on the other and filled with savory soup and pork on the inside theyre quite large and served in orders of 4 one order per person is more than enough we also always ordered pork noodle soup noodles cooked to their proper doneness in a flavorful broth fried pork chops a shanghai specialty also found its way onto our plate most days extra crispy outside and delightfully moist and tender inside picture menus make it easy to order the place is kept clean and service was friendly, highly recommended for anyone who wants to have some local food yet is maybe worried about the foreign ordering process just join the line pick something off the menu to the cashier pay the money join the other line and watch the dumplings being made grab a seat at a table you may have to share have a go at eating the giant hot dumplings with chopsticks

i got 6 mixed dumplings for 16rmb and they were great definitely a bit different to dumplings i have had before but very very yummy

got chatting to some taiwan tourists and had a great experience good option for solo travellers, the dumpling tastes so yummy its a bit different than other dumplings in taiwan its crunchy on the outside but so tasty insides please be careful with every bite it is very juicy, i rarely have time to venture out of my hotel after a day of meetings but i love dumplings  yangs is spotlessly clean the staff are friendly and the menu is in english i ordered the meat and the seafood  the seafood was exceptional the meat was about too ambiguous for me to enjoy eat like a local for pennies not pounds  its great fun, i ordered 5 different dumpling dish from the english menu very good and hot take a small bite and suck the juice inside, this is a food chain that can be found all over shanghai this might be the reason why the quality of the food has dropped service not really friendly the dough was rather chewy, fried to crisps on the outside full of juiciness and meat on the inside they serve cheap and good fried dumplings bite a little and suck out the juices slowly  it is hot, order and pay thereafter collect or wait for your food to be served depending on what you ordered the dumplings are delicious and full of flavor each mouth is bursting with the well seasoned fillings, a fun busy place for great dumplings and wonton soup order your food and pay for it on the way inpick up your dumplings right opposite the cashier then go to a table to have other items delivered, this restaurant is fast and cheap they have three kinds of dumplings meat shrimp and veggie i got the combo plate which had two of each they also have soup and noodles but my advice is stick with the dumplings the interior is clean and the service is really quick great for a quick meal while on the go in shanghai, one of the highlights of my trip are these crisp soupy flavorful dumplings theyre so good they have other items such as noodles and soup noodles theyre ok id rather not waste my stomach room on those itemsand just eat their dumplings, if you are a little hungry for lunchtime you will not be disappointed after you have been here for only 16 yuan 23� about you can have the six dumplings i put the picture of 2 vegetables 2 meat  beef or pork dont know most probably beef  2 shrimp  very good little place but people finish their meal not too slowly try it, we tried the mixed dumpling plate which consists of 6 dumplings and 3 different types they were all good service was friendly and helpful and the waitress spoke english, not far from nanjing east road metro you can see the people making and cooking the dumplings right in front of you

i ordered the 3 different flavour fried dumplings which were 18 rmb to take out you can also eat inside if you wish to you get 2 with pork fillings 2 with vegetable fillings and 2 with prawn fillings

take a small bite of it because there is some soup inside and you dont want to get it everywhere delicious cheap and filling, yangs dumplings is a small chain with about three places in shanghai and its great delicious prawn dumplings friend on their base to seal in the prawn and delicious stock inside and topped with sesame seeds also ordered the pork wanton noodle soup which was equally delicious it was full of locals but i asked on entering whether they had an english menu and they did just put your order in at the entrance and pay and wait for it all to be delivered the simplest foods are the best in china and this is definitely worth a visit, first night in shanghai and first restaurant of the trip and it was really good it was suggested by the lonely planet and it was a good suggestion you see the dumpling cooked in front of the window and you can choose different selection one of the best was the vegetable tasty and delicious then you have pork and shrimps try them all, great fried dumpling at a very good price possible to eat in or take away close kind of early like rest of shanghai, ok its fast food you likely wont be greeted with huge smile and welcoming arms but you can get 10 dumplings and 2 sodas for under $5 us we got the regular set of 4 and another mixed set of 6 you can see them fry them through the window and we actually found the young lady at register funny and friendly when we did engage in quick conversation the dumplings are crispyslightly crunchy on one side be careful to poke a hole first, amazing dumplings just a few roads off the nanjing road perfectly fried and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside we tried the dumpling plate we got 6 big dumplings  two shrimp two pork and two vegetarian perfect for lunch, good dumplings and good moment for someone who is hungry a bit fat very cheap
i tried the yangs dumplings + a very nice fish ball soup less than 15 rmb for both
good but far from din tai fung","steakhouse",0.999785102910727
200,"the food was amazing as always with any din tai fung of course the xiao long bao are the best also the service and attention to our kids was perfect they even make little animals out of the dumpling dough, had lunch at dtf on friday with a group of work colleagues absolutely outstanding quality of dumplings and other local foods and service was excellent dtf was crowded but our wait was relatively short given the numbers hanging around waiting to get in they really do a good job in turning tables service is quick food is freshly made and you can watch them make the dumplings in the window would highly recommend dtf for anyone looking for good quick lunch without eating fast food or street food if you like dim sum this is a great place, this brand is quite famous so it is recommended if you want dumplings and do not know where to go i love xiaolongbao but if i want to eat my fill of it i would be looking at 23 large portions all to myself the most annoying part is the veggies that are all 4050rmb for boiled vegetables that being said the quality is very consistent in all their restaurants so you cant go wrong if this the kind of food you want at a certain moment in time, this is a good din tai fung but not the best if i go there again i would stay with dumplings and tea, you will be hard pressed to find a dumpling better than what you can find at din tai fung  regardless of the location tina our server was awesome very friendly and service minded the atmosphere at the restaurant is sleek and nondescriptive  the food besides tina is the star at this place, i am told that getting into din tai fung in the san francisco bay area is tough to do so we set our sights on this one and arrived when the doors opened at 1030 am we had a terrific meal and if it were not for the fact that i was on a mission to try as many restaurants in shanghai during my short five day stay as i could i would have returned several times the evening before i noticed scores of folks waiting for their number to be called for the pleasure of eating here i understand why

in my book it always starts with service and you will never find better personal service than at din tai fung in the kerry centre my server was shelley and we communicated the old fashioned way when language is a slight barrier we pointed and smiled a lot it was not long before we were sipping on beer that was colder than your exwife�s heart while waiting on our food shelley was excellent and we went out of our way to handwrite a restaurant service review before we departed i would highly recommend getting a seat in her section

i loved the hot and sour soup the fried fish and of course we had three different types of xiaolongbao normally restaurants fail to live up to the hype and particularly touted meals follow that is not the case here you many find xiaolongbao which is just as good but never better

i noticed an earlier reviewer comparing this restaurant as the mcdonalds of the dumpling world in my view you could never make a more ridiculous illinformed comparison i do not care how many restaurants they have when you serve food this good you should open as many restaurants as you can this is simply a clean wellpriced beautiful restaurant with absolutely topnotch service and superb food, its a chain restaurant in a snazzy shopping mall i went to try the xianlongbao supposedly the best in the city i did try them elsewhere and do not agree however this is a good clean standard restaurant of assured consistent quality a bit like mcdonalds of the dumpling world actually slightly more high end possibly like byron burger but overall i was satisfied and if i was desperate and hungry i would go here but if i ever go to shanghai again it do not believe i would eat here there are better places although i dont really like chains which is my disclaimer but as chains go its a good one, very clean and practical place for eating clean and good price restaurant went at least 3 times in two weeks, great simple cheap chinesetaiwanese food  quick informal dinner with friends colleagues super wonton spicy total cost per person with drinks 200euros 9 people  they close a little bit too early  they do not speak a very good english but they are very warm, had a business lunch meeting here and my local colleagues ordered a variety of dishes every dish was very good ive eaten local cuisine at multiple locations the past few days and this was by far the best, just loved the food a great dimsum meal with family nice atmosphere spacious the staff was extremely helpful and spoke english we had a few vegetarians in the group and they had many options on the menu for them definitely worth a visit if you are in puxi, ok bad news it is in a shiny fancy bit soulless mallgood news food was really fantastic and not very expensive dumplings are the best ive ever had service friendly and efficient try all the dumplings, din tai fung is worldwide taiwanese chain offering a broad selection of fresh delicious dumplings these treats are best eaten with a dipping sauce of soy sauce vinegar and t touch of ginger  all offered tableside the menu is full of photos and english descriptions to help out with ordering my favorites were the mushroom dumplings and garlic spinach with a refreshing bottle of san p also they take credit cards

enjoy, great chain restaurant always a dependable high standard well worth going to for casual lunch or dinner, if you want to taste dumplings do not hesitate to visit this taiwanese chain great food great service but not cheap a must , although this is a chain the dumplings here are definitely made fresh and to order on the premisses its on the 4th floor of a modern upmarket mall at the jingan end of nanjing road west its the only place where we had to wait for a table at lunch time but you get a numbered ticket and get called when your turn comes up we only waited about 15 mins as its a big dining area with quick turnover we had 5 each of 4 different types of dumplings the delicate sacks full of delicious soup which then reveals the filling definitely the best dim sum ive had with the possible exception of a wong in pimlico, it is ok after eating the one in taipei this is kind of a let down the vegetable buns are not properly mixed some of them barely had any vegetable also many of the side dishes are way too salty, i read in a magazine this were the best dumplings in shanghai but sadly are from taipei
i decided to give it a shot and woowwwww
best dumplings ever
there are a chicken with truffle that are simply amazing, being this restaurant close to my office i had lunch here an uncountable number of times service is excellent you are served quickly the staff remembers you and your tastes and is always trying to please you very clean excellent quality both for dumplings and starters or vegetables teas are good but i have given up to drink anything which is not bottle water in china
like many restaurants in china it is in a shopping mall which for europeans is a bit uncharming and cold better for lunch than for dinner you may have to cue during rush hours alternatively you can book","hot pot house",0.914495265505563
201,"exceptional food  dumpling dim sum etc every thing is perfect and relatively affordable kids loved it as well and begged us to return to this place the next day, my favourite restaurant in shanghai its a must everything i go a wide selection of dumplings filled with delicious stuff my favourites pork and crab mixed and chestnutred bean cream for dessert tasty but light food  delicious  nice service clean environment very very recommended, i love this restaurant from the first time i go there they have from outside an open window where you can see the preparation of the dumplings a bit expensive but good quality food i recommend this one to a lot of friends and they like it too so its time for you to test it, both my child and i love this restaurant dumplings are delicious and noodles too desert with rice pearls and coconut milk is a must every time we go usually we share three different kind of dumplings then noodles for my child the ones with soy sauce for me the spicy peanuts one then desert

two things that we dont like are bad acoustic so it gets loud there is usually a queue so better go early

still it has great views over the river to the bund, good xiao long baos the black truffle boas are a must and the steamed rice cake stuffed with red bean paste dessert is to die for, this restaurant was on my lists but i bumped into it accidentally on the grand gateway 66 mall 5th floor near xujiahui metro station
excellent soup noodles and dumplings choices instructed by the friendly staff

great food for lunch, when you go to dtf it is always for same reason get honest xialongbao for a western service and a western price  xialongbao are very cheap and average popular food which chinese eat at end of each meal when still hungry  sale price is usually 12 rmb for 10 instead of 60 rmb in dtf
this being told it remain a good food experience for an affordable price even if it is outrageous for what it is, i arrived to this restaurant with a note written in chinese that said severe life threatening allergy to fish i ordered chicken and pork dumpling and a side of green vegetables i explained to the waitress that the kitchen should be careful i took 2 bites and had my throat closing on me i ended up in the hospital emergency room after 2 epipen injections and had one of my worst reactions
i would not recommend this restaurant because of cross contamination, i find it difficult to find good quality dumplings in shanghai this is a casual dining option which is tasty and easy to order for english speakers, im definitely not a huge fan of dumplings but i have to admit that the ones from this restaurant are among the best ive ever tried and especially their pork signature ones the chicken bouillon was also incredible however the starters were disappointing good and reactive service all in all good experience, i like to stop in once on every trip  and i have never been disappointed  great dumplings  i love the crab dumplings  and the location on world shopping center i think is the best  great location  great service and the food is excellent  this is a must stop when in shanghai , the best soup dumplings in the world have tried different locations in shanghaithey are all consistently great highly recommend, we ate at this restaurant thinking it was the same place we had eaten on a previous trip but discovered that although it is in the same mall and same floor the restaurant we had actually eaten at was crystal jade we thought the food and service was good it is hard to compare the dumplings because we ate at crystal jade several years ago but the ambiance at crystal jade is far superior but i think you pay for that ambiance we had pork and chicken xiaolongbao soup dumlings which were very good as well as green beans as a side also very good i would like to return to both restaurants in the future to compare dumplings and prices, have frequented this chain in shanghai all the dishes to include soups dumplings and fried rice are always good notices that there are usually several expats dining when i come that usually the give away that the food is good

it is not a visual atmosphere but it is more of a casual location good food and service, din tai fung is always popular with visitors but even some of us local expats have a regular need for those great dumplings in the grand gateway shopping centre the dishes served are consistent with all their sister restaurants in shanghai taste great very fresh perhaps a down side is the grand gateway venue doesnt have much atmosphere window seats are certainly best so try requesting them bookings are not possible after 1200 midday at this place they are that popular on the plus side its a large restaurant so the wait time has normally been less than 10 minutes at least the few times weve been on a weekend go for the dishes not the atmosphere fortunately service has always been excellent, i went to this restaurant 5 or 6 times since i was staying at a nearby hotel
it sits at the top floor of a luxury shopping mall grand gateway
for sure the best and most tasty dumplings and xiaolongbao i have tasted in shanghai but also the most expensive

service fast and good although all waiters except 1 struggled with english, a friend and i were determined to try a din tai fung while in shanghai and found this one near the yu garden we were happy that we came here because we passed by the market in yu garden and got some really good bargains for souvenirsand had fun bargaining in general

the exterior of this din tai fung was not spectacularwe almost thought it had closed down because it wasnt well decorated and was in a building that looked abandoned

but once we got up to the restaurant we got really excited the service was superbeverybody greeted you and all the waiters and waitresses were very polite and smiling all the time i know its sad that this kind of service is considered excellent nowadays when greeting customers and being polite to them is actually so basic

the dumplings as expected did not disappoint but the dessert i hadthe taro sago was lukewarm and i didnt feel too well afterwards that was a huge disappointment given the fact that this place is supposed to be the best chinese restaurant globally according to the awards displayed in the restaurant

din tai fung is greatbut i wouldnt say its necessarily the best chinese restaurant according to cnn in the world or maybe im just not the biggest fan of dumplings its not like i had never had good dumplings before anyway, the food is excellent and the service as usual very accurate and fast but the location is not quite up to the normal standards of their chain the outside was in construction and inside it was not cooled enough and the design was to simple all of this is not aligned to the cost of the food, ive lived in china for three years and sampled many different types of
xiaolongbao soup dumplings from small street restaurants to upscale ones and i have to say din tai fung has some of the best the quality of xiaolongbao depends on the thinness of the skin the amount of meat and the volume of soup din tai fung consistently maintains a good balance of the three with every order so whether youre new to china or have been here awhile you cant go wrong with din tai fungits a great culinary experience that you dont want to miss, my husband frequents this restaurant every time he visits shanghai and theres a good reason
we ordered 3 selections to share the pork pillows the crab pillows and the shrimp shaomei
all were mouthwatering and delicious the pillows are small dumplings with a filling and a bit of soup in the bottom
we shared a bottle of wine and smiled all the way back to our hotel a perfect last meal in shanghai
highest recommendation, i have been a fan of this place but downtown  changed hotels this trip and this location is walking distance  very convenient  clean  good service and open all day 

i sampled the different dumplings and all were very good  also had the wontons and that was good also 

good place to eat when in town , a taiwanese chain with a deserved reputation for excellent dumplings youll love the food whether youre local or expat or tourist

i went with a local crowd and they loved it  but the company was paying bottom line is it is pricey but very westerrn friendly while being authentic chinese

now it is a restaurant that in an upscale shopping mall i loathe eating in windowless boxes other love it your choice, ive eaten at the din tai fung in bellevue and it was very good id never eaten at one of the many in china or taiwan this one is excellent the dumplings are first rate and they did a great job with the vegetables  crisp  tender with the right amount of spice and heat strongly recommend for westerners who like true chinese food

of course if you dont want to travel to eat at one you can get it at many of their properties at other locations in the world, din tai fung restaurants are in lots of places in shanghai and are consistently excellent the food is great especially the dumplings and the menu has pictures and english translation to make ordering easy they even give you a guide to eating xiao long bao dumplings  a lot of locals feel its overpriced but for an expat its a guarantee of quality cleanliness and great service so its worth the extra money, we had another great meal here recently the restaurant is pretty and chic the service good and unobtrusive the food marvellous the dumplings are the reason to come they are absolutely delicious but portions can be small for greedy eaters like me order a lot of food i will be back soon, a good restaurant to bring westerners who are not too adventurous when it comes to food good quality food with really a lot of flavours and very goo service
been there twice in a 10 day stay when i was a bit tired of fish heads jellyfish and fish noodles
i definitely recommend, i love simple pork and the one with truffles are excellent
service gentle and efficient
eve one should taste once to know how good are fresh made dim sum
it is the value to wait a table
i love simple pork and the one with truffles are excellent
service gentle and efficient
eve one should taste once to know how good are fresh made dim sum
it is the value to wait a table, ive been hearing din tai fung as the best place to try xiao long bao but i think all the hype brought high expectations wasnt really a wow for me but their food is okay i must praise their servers though they are very professional the most professional i have seen in china i ate during lunch with friends so you must understand the place was jampacked but the servers attended to every table and kept their customers satisfied if youre going for lunch be sure to be there before 12 to get seats

pork xlb is okay
spicy wontons are good
fried rice is also good, i have been trying the tripadvisor favorites these last days din tai fung is by far my favorite

the steamed dumplings are a dream and the ox soup was delicious","Sichuan cuisine",0.901459759990092
203,"this is what china is all about food this time its sichuan style hot pot with unbelievable service must try the numbingly spicy hot broth once you stop feeling anything in your mouth go for the tomato broth truly amazing get there early or else you wait in line, after sightseeing and shopping at tianzifang we hopped on a cab to the nearby haidilao for late lunch

the restaurant is located on the 4th floor of the jinrulan plaza and it is massive like other hailidao joints it offers various types of soup basse from nonspicy mild to superhot chongqing mala and you can choose single or up to four types of soup

the raw ingredients are very fresh and theres quite a variety of them to choose from while dining in the patrons can get free manipedi done playing board games and the kids can play at the playground

this is the first time we dined in a steamboat restaurant that offers complimentary services such as manicurepedicure shoe shining board game with freeflow snack inhouse playground and foot massage theres practically something for everybody whats not to love


tip
1 the live performance of pulling kungfu noodles is the specialty of haidilao its highly entertaining and the noodles are delicious, i must say it was a bit intimidating at first not knowing what to do with the whole process but it is worth learning you are seated at a table with a deep well in front of you in which you can select two types of broths we selected a mild and a very spicy which in our opinion was not unpalatable but the again we grow ghost peppers at home a server pours each broth into each side and turns on the gas and they each get boiling hot

then you are given a menu which does have english and you select a meat and several vegetables and usually a tofu side you also select a noodle which they bring in the end while these are being prepared you are taken to a little salad bar to get a little salad and your dipping sauces

by the time you get back to your table all of your sides are there and you basically drop some of your sides into the broth of your choice and then fish them out when they are done and eat them with your dipping sauces the meat sinks so there is a special spoon to cook the meat in so the meat does not sink now we did not know any of this so the server was very patient with us in teaching us every step of the way at the end a very entertaining man came out and hand stretched out noodles buy making lassos out of them literally which in the end were hand cut and placed into the broth to finish the dinner out

it was a wonderful experience which wound up costing us about 25$ for the two of us we absolutely loved it i hope this review helps take some of the anxiety away from some of you who have not gone out of fear of the unknown 

by the time you get back, very popular hotpot restaurant be prepared to queue during meal times no reservation for good reason ingredients are fresh and reasonably priced be aware that this is a popular and successful chain their soup base is prepacked and while tasty it contains a little too much oil and msg for my taste, ive been to hai di lao hotpot in shenzhen im two separate occasions and this hotpot restaurant chain surely will not disappoint it was my girlfriends first time to have dinner here and she had a great time

we were greeted by extremely helpful staff with smiling faces they were always extending extra services to make each guest experience a unique one when they found out that we are not from town they even brought us extra cups of snacks for us to enjoy tiny touches such as these are what i look for in every haidilao visit

i will continue to be a loyal customer to the best hotpot restaurant chain ever, this hotpot chain has one of the best services in town all the staff are friendly and smiley not a given thing in the restaurants scene here food is fresh and reasonably priced personally love the mushroom soup base and also love that dishes not sure if its for all comes in full size and half size which gives flexibilityvariety and reduce wastage however be prepared to wait given its popularity and good hospitality expect to wait for an hour and up but not to worry the staff will hand you snacksdrinks and even board games to keep you occupied while waiting and lastly they do delivery as well so you can place order and enjoy hotpot in the comfort in your own home guess locals already know this, how can i describ the service very excellent u can fell every waiter or waitress there are very positive and friendly they always watch what you need and help you even when you go to the wash room there will be a waitress serve for you","Chinese cuisine",0.53671021821374
204,"nice environment especially the outdoor restaurant quite full better reserve table in advance food is average dont expect its very authentic but for business is not bad if your clients are foreigners, the garden was just lovely with the tall bamboo trees around and the red lights on you might even think you are in south east asia except that the night was pleasant and exceedingly hot like se asia at this time of the year food was delicious, there is an incredible lack in the menu the essential thai dessert sticky rice with mango appart from that place is nice and you can even have your diner in a garden dont forget to take your mosquitos repellent spray with you, the qualityprice rate is just unbeatable dishes from 40 to 120 rmb on a wide range of fruit salads crab and veggies aperitizers and meatbased mains normally the spicy sauces are served apart so it<u+00b4>s up to each one i have a delicate stomach and it<u+00b4>s not easy to find a thai place not affecting diggestion at night

make sure you make a reservation indicating to sit in the courtyard and order wine by bottle to not spend so much always drinks arising bills in sh it is perfect either for quiet couple dinners families groups of friends or even business quite good food for the prize charged and the atmospehere is one of the nicest in town recommend 100, i love this restaurant of the french concession it is more known as coconut paradise i have been here many times and both indoor and in the garden the environment is very pleasant if you sit in the garden in the summer mosquitos can be an issue bring the repellent along they have it but didnt work food quality is mediumgood wine choice could be better we had s pretty low quality prosecco for cny 260 what i think it should be improved is the service they often forget some plates they did twice in less than a yearand it took them 20 minutes for doing a receipt nobody left except us communication in english is ok but it could be better, if we want to have a good thai dinner my wife and me always visit this restaurant the food is really good upper class thai style the restaurant is also really nice decorated so its a good place to spent some hours together there are a lot of foreigners there also it seems that the most are no tourists and have the same experience like we paying the bill you have to close your eyes because its not the cheapest place but also not to expensive the service was very good sometimes we go there also with foreign company guests, food is ok and portions are big however taste wise i dont think that is amazing
music was also loud for a tuesday
very nice atmosphere, the tyg soup is good and acceptable the rest  no relation with thaillande highly localized food for thai food lovers  walk away the service  we asked drink without ice it came with  we asked papaya salad which was announced sold out asking to choose another meal while a waiter served it to us  we asked large soupe and got small one  the list would be long service and food with no relation to the price, beautiful ambiance good food friendly staff it is a renovated frenchstyle villa with spacious enclosed garden it is one of shanghais most popular thai eateries candle lit interior decorated with buddhist artifacts make for an atmospheric setting, i have been here many times already and always had a great experience besides the amazing dishes seafood salad grilled chicken wrapped in leafs the place is really worth a visit itself located inside a old colonial villa near jinan temple this is a unique experience wooden furnitures wooden floor cute garden outside  really beautiful

keep in mind that you definitely have to wait longer if you havent reserved even during the week so make sure to book in advance, also called coconut paradise the restaurant is easy to find 1 block south and 1 block east of jiang an temple its a bit dark inside with red lamps and ambient lighting that provide a very relaxing and comfy environment the food was outstanding and the devise was too the prices are inline with shanghais midrange restaurant scene though i feel nearly all such places are too expensive 50 rmb for most appetizers 60200 rmb for most dinners  40 rmb for fruit drinks beer and wine varies as well, best restaurant in shanghai its a thai restaurant named coconut paradise food is great delicious big plate so tasty i ate grilled beef i can tell you special and wok rice noodle with vegetable never eated noodles so special we find that place in our last day in shanghai otherwise we will com there every evening not easy in shanghai to find good restaurant usually food is bad the location is romantic in a garden so nice its made with red tableclots and red lamps i like the place so much also the service was finei will come back and i will suggest to friends to go there, this one is on my private list number one among all thai restaurants in shanghai point
some years ago the chain restaurant simply thai in the hongmei road was as alternative also competitive but their level went down a bit so yexiang tiantian  or coconut paradise is nowadays number one in shanghai form the atmosphere and service as well as from their extraordinary fine food we love it
only two small disadvantages take care of mosquitos in summer and moreover it is quite crowded like many top places in shanghai so booking in advance normally is needed
but as a compensation you will get outstanding food, coconut paradise is one of the best places to sit outside when weather allows you have to take precautions for the musquitos but besides that i love to sit here as the garden is quiet food is good and staff friendly only disadvantage is they often serve the rice very later after you have had all the dishes so you have to explain several times you want your rice served together with the dishes, this places serves very good thai food and the location  especially sitting outside  is very nice, i love thai food especially in thailand  this place has a good selection of best thai dishes and you cant be wrong with any choice you make i was there many times with friends and we tasted everything one thing that i would always have is fried rice with pineapple and seafood its on the sweet side and it goes very well with spicy green curry as spicy as it can be the place has very romantic ambiance the garden is like oasis in a big city the only difference between thai in thailand and thai in shanghai is the price  its not cheap that is the only reason why we dont go to coconut paradise 3 times a week , pretty romantic garden where to eat i went few times with friends cozy place great food and great french wine i have had unforgettable dinners there even because the location is pretty good considering you are in the french concessionand you have a great beer bar right next to it where to head up after dinner , very nice thai restaurant in shanghai the place is amazing food excellent and staff is friendly excellent place for dinner with friends colleagues or belovers i recommend it and ill go back there, coconut paradise is set on a busy street in the fc but it has clever landscaping that cuts out all the chaos outside the food was delicious a large menu but lost heaven same ownersis still my favourite, i visited coconut paradise with friends in early may we sat outside in a lovely garden setting the menu was varied and the service attentive the atmosphere was remarkably thai for a restaurant on a very ordinary road in shanghai the food was good and pricing was good value a real pleasure, the service and attention could not be better the dishes are truly thai cuisine with its spicy but without exaggeration the waiter attentive and knowledgeable about all the dishes so their recommendation was a success, good food extremely friendly staff quality is very authentic space is abit tight not your fine dining choice more for group gathering or a romantic night out very popular so be sure to make a reservation, the magic of this place is the location and ambience it is located just off a moderately busy street but seems worlds away there is a large outdoor dining area that feels like a lush thai jungle the restaurant itself is an older home type building and the 45 tables on the balcony overlooking the courtyard is fantastic you forget that you are in shanghai except for the occasional horn honk from a passing car the food is good and there is good variety on the menu the prices are a little high but as expected in a restaurant that caters to travelers in the french concession area definitely worth a visit if in the area and it is an easy walk from the hotels and shops on west nanjing rd, as a fan of thai food this place did not disappoint outside is particularly nice at this time of year with a nicely laid out patio area will likely be back, i been already many times in this restaurant the first time wasnt really great experience in fact i didnt eat because issue with reservation table and i left
but i thought to not penalize this restaurant only because the hostess and some supervisor doesnt know how to work well
i been again after a week after send an email to the manager and make sure that it was a normal mistake and never will happen again
the food is amazing the manager tony is a good manager fortunately after 12 time i been there the hostess start to recognise me and not let me wait anymore for get a table
i will continue to be back till the treatment is the same, i am really disappointed with this restaurant i was told its the best thai restaurant in shanghai but turn out to be the worst food we ordered green chicken curry and the taste is so diluted the pandan chicken is tasteless the salted fish vegetable is the worst the fish is really bad the most important sudh is the thai rice and i can tell you its the worst rice in i ever tasted in my life not to mentioned the service nobody is experience and only know to standing around without doing anything the conclusion is if you have a choice please try other thai restaurant even the manager is not around, ive visited many thai restaurants around the world and including in thailand coconut paradise ranks very high on my list for authentic thai cooking
i had the pineapple chicken curry which was simply delicious my friends all enjoyed their food and the service was excellent all the staff were very friendly and helpful
the prices were quite reasonable and the ambience was very relaxed and comfortable
ill be visiting this restaurant again, we have been here few times the food is consistently very goodspicy with healthy thai herbscocktails are fine with decent price service is fine without big scratchesnon intrusiverecommend, i have been there once and the garden is beautiful if i can give you an advice go there during warm night food is good and not that expensive, our company ate there with a large party in the outside dining area to the right when you walk in it was very cold as it didnt appear to be heated however the thai food was very tasty including the many curries and fish would definitely return but eat inside, i was there the first time and i like the atmosphere the food we had was all spicy rich and hot as it should be try the cocktails alongside with the food and youre in heaven , while the surroundings are really nice older building well restorated garden to dine outside in spring or autumn the food is averagely good but nothing fantastic they do all the staples of thai restaurants in china and like in many cases with tastes a bit on the sugary  heavy sides without much subtlety so you can go for green curry pad thai tom kha gai pak pong fai deng or other curries you can expect to be satisfied but not overjoyed at what you get the wine list is correct but over priced as often with new world bottles of dubious quality one shiraz australian was quite good though and went down quite well with spicier dishes if you can try also lost heaven from the same owner sichuan  burmese cuisine with more originality than their thai endeavor, we visited coconut paradise based on tripadvisor ratings and comments and also because i walked by it on my site seeing walks
the venue is beautifully decorated love the garden
the food is good we had different starters and main courses
the curry was a bit disappointing it was too runny
be careful when you pay with credit card a western credit card they charge you a crazy exchange rate something like 10 difference to market rate, classic shanghai restaurant in the same vein as lost heaven great atmosphere decent but certainly not great thai food nice garden as well for good weather make sure to reserve the old building as opposed to the newer annex, the place looks great and it is also famous the staff is friendly but can be trained a bit better the food did not come at the same time which is terrible when you have dinner together the spicy minced chicken is great however the rest is just ok, took my husband to dinner last night for his birthday not our first time and never lets us down with their incredible bursts of flavor with each dish never can order just a few dishes so try several as they make great lunches the next day, this restaurant is definitely one of the best thai food i have ever experienced
you have a large choice  fish rice meat spicy not spicy etc you also have nice cocktail along your food

waiter and waitress are welcoming toilets are clean

the only thing is maybe the price which is a bit too high for shanghai but i recommend it for everyone who spend few days in this lovely city v, went there with a friend of mine after she suggested it but only based on experiences from friends of friends so basically no expectations luckily we booked a table because on a friday night it is almost impossible to get one by luck although it looked very touristy many locals still go there
the food was great everything we ordered was delicious and also the cocktails they serve are ok good restaurant to start a clubbing night  
the service was also nice although he managed to step like 3 times on my foot   but no worries everything was good one last tip at the end it was a bit pricey for asian cousine in shanghai enjoy, iwas entertaining some foreign guests and wanted to let them have a taste of chinese wine we ask the waitress and she quoted an exhorbitant corkage pricemore expensive than the winewe ask to talk to the manager who was even more rude and told us that if we do not like it they do not need our business we were a group of 15 and if it were not because of my guests we would have left immediately anyway it will be last time we go there, this thai land mark in shanghai have too many customers to keep his authentic original touch
we shanghai people never go there only when foreigners visit we book this place
food average bot not special environement still fascinating, the place has nice atmosphere and good service i ordered the coconut prawns and what a mistake first the portions are very some for the high prices at this place you just get 3 prawns with this dish and my three were over cooked and the shells stuck to the fish they were very hard to peel very messy dish the other people i was with had better experience than me with their food
lastly a lot of dinners smoke in the outdoor garden area no fun while you are trying to eat, visited this restaurant for the first time and was very happy to find such a good thai restaurant in shanghai after being here for more than 2 years its quite pricy and portions are small but the food is excellent service staff is also very courteous and attentive i will come back again, i think its the best thai restaurant in shanghai but not as good as those we tried in thailand its a beautiful place with authentic decorations but with same price you could get even better food in thailand, the food was great though it was definitely a chinese twist on thai food great service and excellent ambiance would definitely come back again, part of lost heaven group it is one of the best thai in shanghai
located in the beautiful french concession
atmosphere it is very nice food and service very good also price is very good
it is recomended to reserve
dont miss it, this restaurant and lost heaven are the two best thai restaurants in the french concession area make it a point to go here  its a lite less pricy than lost heaven reservation recommended, this place seems always busy expect that you will be directed to the bar because your table that you reserved is not ready yet maybe they do it extra to con an extra drink out of you
the garden area is nice to sit in the summer we sat inside because it had rained earlier
food was ok some dishes seemed lacking something salt or spiciness
you pay here more for the atmosphere and for the food i think, we enjoyed excellent thai food at coconut paradise restaurant in shanghai fumin lu the ambiance is excellent in an old mansion candlelight and a pleasant personal setting service is very good the bar is one of the best we have seen in shanghai restaurants

we ordered a number of traditional thai dishes for dinner including tom yam soup curry and pad thai the food was good and reasonably priced we enjoyed a quiet romantic evening

reservations are recommended or there will be a wait however the bar is a good place for quiet conversation it is easy to get a taxi after dinner, stayed in shanghai recently and went to the restaurant in fumin road very busy and had to wait in the small but cosy bar but worth the wait as the food was excellent sit inside or out the ambience was lovely and service good really enjoyed the evening and friends went there the following day and confirmed my thoughts as a great choice, the restaurant is really a nice place you can sit outside and inside it is a cosy athmosphere

the food is really poor
tomyam soup tastes like water the fish cakes had a strong taste like old fish red curry chicken was poor and so on
dont go there

205,"i have been at corso como s restaurant with a friend for an easy dinner the environment is quite nice sophisticated and calm
the food menu offers limited choices and we had vitello tonnato and fois grad as appetizers fois gras was not bad but it was supposed to come with seasonal vegetables and it came just with 3 small slices of caramelized apple the desserts very nice in presentation but the taste was average the spritz was very watered just for these few dishes 1 spritz 1 appetizer 1 dessert per person and the bill was unreasonably expensive it is definitely not one of my recommended places, i have been in this restaurant with some of my colleagues and their partners for a christmas celebration the chef corrado prepared a typical italian christmas dinner with excellent quality and super wines  nothing to add more than this perfect, went to 10 corso como a few times for their friday evening special which was a surprisingly good value walking into the stunning building and going up to the bar was an experience of its kind wonderful staff member and welcoming host strongly recommended for friday happy hour the dinning room looks enticing and will try next time, rarely do you find good italian food in east asia but this one counts i had the set menu for lunch and chose salad and gnocchi my friend had the vegetarian lasagna which looked a little dismal but she said it was tasty so i cant say anything against it the carrot and ginger soup got good reviews too dessert was a chocolate bavarese that was quite tasty rich but not too sweet, beautiful collection but chinas luxury tax means few things i can afford cocktails in the bar are nice and if youre lucky enough you can score a table with a view of the temple, 10 corso como is the place to be if you are a thirsty hungry fashion guy looking for fun wonderful food and accurate cocktails daniele roberta and corrado will make it possible, been there for a biz dinner with friends from different countries we let the chef corrado choose for us the menu that we really enjoy it special mention to the starters, i have been to this restaurant alone and i truly enjoyed the food i had a tiramisu with onions bottarga and shrimps which was interesting but the best was the risotto with mussels and popcorn of tomato water in nitrogen it was delicious and innovative must visit in shanghai, if you happen to pass in the district of jingan in shanghai i suggest you take a look at the building  10 corso como  in addition to the shop you will find original art gallery  bar and italian restaurant a the top floor the bar supports the famous italian aperitif ritual and on friday night as well as the beautiful view of the illuminated temple you can enjoy fine delicacies the restaurant as well as to have a original atmosphere and to be attended by people in fashion is signed by an extravagant italian star chef i suggest you to taste the artistic dishes because corrado the chef is able to create choreography worthy to be eaten true kitchen artfully, nice to escape up on fifth level of very trendy restaurant  we truly enjoyed the architecture and decor of this place had a wonderful meal with nice wine and exceptional service  pasta was probably the best we have ever had obviously freshly made need escape from chinese  you will find it here, situated in central jingan district at 5th floor with partial view on the jingan temple this modern italian restaurant deserves excellent italian modern cuisine by master chef corrado michelazzo and a rich wine list by sommelier roberta mo

chef corrado is an amazing modern style italian chef and your wife is very kind with all guest

great food and great experience every time i visit , lovely dining experience at 10 corso como in shanghai a place i cannot miss whenever visiting the city trendy place for business lunch in day time and chic place for fine dining in night time authentic italian and european dishes fresh ingredients ordered by chef day to day if youre picky about the food the setting and even the wash room this may be the next interesting place you should go for a try

nice chef and i always love his dishes not to miss the traditional italian dessert panna cotta the truly authentic panna cotta that you can find in asia in particular, having heard so much about this restaurant and reading what other reviewers wrote we were looking forward to the meal unfortunately the hype did not match our expectations

the meal began well with the deep fried calamari being the best item on the menu  it was crunchy and yet not oily the risotto with one smoked langoustine was nice too  well flavoured and al dente the way i like it the langoustine was also grilled nicely though i would have liked one more

the mains were veal tenderloin and this was also prepared well but unremarkable for dessert we selected the white chocolate pineapple canelloni and the mini galaxy it was unusual to use the pineapple as the canelloni and while the dish was nice it was rather difficult to cut through the pineapple in the end we left it alone and just scooped out the white chocolate the mini galaxy was prepared at the table but we felt it was not well presented they used an acrylic base and plate and there was a small crack on the eating surface the waitress layered streaks of different sauces ranging from raspberry to chocolate as well as vanilla and cocoa rice puffs before pouring some nitrogen into the base it felt contrived the taste was okay but not memorable

do note that they do not serve water here you can get imported bottled water or try their cocktails we had the americano and the caipirinha fire both of which were unremarkable other than the strong taste of ginger and chilli in the latter

i will return to try the fried calamari again as it is certainly worth a visit

am reposting this as ta lost 25 of my recent reviews and did not publish them, carla sozannis and kris ruhs thoughtful touch is present throughout this building i have not eaten there yet but have had drinks in the bar several times very chill great service and interesting mix of people the sunsets are beautiful looking east as the light reflects on the puli and west nanjing lu lights up, what a wonderful place right in the heart of downtown shanghai the restaurant is on the 5 th floor of a multi purpose building the ground floor is this really cool book shop with a coffee shop the decor in the restaurant is pure italy round tables with leather couches and chairs the service is super fine very unassuming but personal and warm the menu is dominated by seafood  so restrictive if that is not what you are looking for i had seared tuna as a starter served with dry ice at your table it was delicious for main course i took the mushroom and asparagus risotto cooked to perfection with coffee we were served with a selection of small cookies and chocolates a delightful way to finish

this is a restaurant for special occasions or to take colleagues and clients it has a very mature and sophisticated feel to it, i havent tried the restaurant yet but their lounge on the 5th floor has a special on fridays from 630pm to 9pm for aperitivo italiano  with 98 rmb you get a drink and a tasteful spread of italian appetizers along with great atmosphere stylish people and stunning views on jing an temple this one is truly when milan meets asia experience the whole store is a visual bliss itself a true testament of the superb italian style, chef corrado is an amazing modern style italian chef that likes to push the boundaries of modern italian cuisine people that criticise his style really dont understand what he is trying to achieve

206,"there is a great place to be with friends for a happy hour  they have a selection of drinks with discount and offer they steak sandwich for free during the happy hour really delicious , not cheap but you get what you pay for
the steak was lush side dishes were huge couldnt eat it all creme brulee, the family likes the juicy and thick beef stake the rest of dishes are also well prepared happy hour offers great combination of finger food plus drinks of choice at great price, we are a family of 4 young children and opted for the bar snacks we had fully expected to be seated in a row at the bar on stools and that would have been novelty in itself but we were pleasantly ushered to a dining area within the bar screened off section it was delightful a quick as a wink the tables were rearranged to accommodate our family and we commenced the order with an array of the barsnacks which are a happy hour special between 57pm mon fri we ordered 5 dishes from this selection and all of us were very adequately full the food was cooked precisely to our requests and staff were always onhand to offer a polite and friendly assistance
it is a great place and you get the sense that they know their meat i didnt see the availability of and nor was i offered any sauces or other condiments chili pepper mustard wostershire salt etc but am sure that they would have them had i requested our snacktype order didnt need any but it might have at least been offered
while the food nay be considered pricy i think that you would be pleased with the quality no matter what you ordered there are some reasonably priced dishes among the standard priced fare and the salads looked tempting we will be back again, they have a great happy hour but the food in their restaurant is excellent
great night out to enjoy a steak and a martini
very expensive but worth it for that special night out, first of all its expensive

thats no surprise mortons are expensive in the united states

aside from that the food was delicious the service was great we were there on a lunch on a nonbusy day it allowed us to relax and really enjoy our time there was a bit of a language challenge not even barrier but that did not disturb our experience one bit

i would recommend this place, had dinner at mortons steakhouse mall connected to the ritzcarlton hotel prices were very reasonable  foodservice was great, the food are good but the service and price not same  and also the day when i was here inside the restaurant was very cold , i used to frequent mortons in hong kong this time being in shanghai i wanted to try their local branch and found the same great quality excellent service breathtaking location and the meatis the best in town most people would say its expensive it is but worth a single rmb, i made this visit a year ago and have not been back since i was encouraged to do this review by a reminder email otherwise i would not have made the effort the environment is first class the view and the decor inside from memory at least was great the service was functional but not inspiring the food did not warrant a review again from memory the steak was not the best i had eaten i am not kind in this review because it was expensive i have visited a lawrys prime rib steak house these are equally expensive but service and food were worth it for me

if you want a good nicely priced steak in shanghai try abbey road, had a lovely christmas dinner the restaurant had a special set menu but still diners could order a la carte this is our 5th visit to mortons shanghai at ifc we were seated facing the pear tower and the hangpu river excellent choice of steak and seafood the sea bass was my favorite with fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp cocktail nice wine list, excellent meat cooked to perfection very good service with good spoken english shanghai standards exceeded if you know what i mean
shanghai standard however the cleanness of the restaurant and toilettes this was below our expectations especially if you consider the price of this culinary experience
if you live in shanghai then you might be willing to compromise  as usual  with cleanness and enjoy the outstanding food coming from a clean kitchen as far as you could see, we have had christmas eve dinner at mortons on dez 24 that was obvoiusly a busy day therefore we happily accepted a set menu food was excellent as you would expect from a mortons steakhouse service however was really unprofessional the service personell obviously tried to serve dinner as quickly as possible even trying to bring the main course already although we were just in the middle of eating our starter this should not happen in any restaurant but even more at mortons with a set menu  rmb 888 per person this is a no no no may be we were just unlucky with our service and the food was as good as you would expect from them but the very bad service took away quite some of the exitement of having dinner there, had a quiet lunch here over the weekend and the steak and salad set was definitely worth the deal great quality and good service, after a few days on the china diet it was a nice change to end up a block from here and get some western food they are trying so hard to make you feel like home and to a great extent they do succeed cocktails were right if a bit smaller than in the states beer selection was familiar the menu was close to familiar with a few local additions mainly seafood service was enthusiastic if a bit uncoordinated still the meal overall was good and we really enjoyed sadly prices are also very familiar youre eating a very western meal in a very eastern place  dont expect any bargains, a very good dinner with colleagues  the restaurant is vey cozy and we had a private corner to ourselves good food especially the steak was fantastic, my twocourse lunch at morton�s � in a weak moment having been away from home for a few weeks and having enjoyed lots of regional quite wellprepared chinese cuisine was craving a steak and potatoes experience � was probably the worst overly expensive meal i�ve had in a decade

disgusting the ribeye was stringy laden with fat couldn�t the chefs have dealt with that in the kitchen before slapping it on a plate where it looked all grey and gross there was a big hunk of melted butter with waytoomuch garlic dumped on top the mashed potatoes were okay but dense as if laced with cream cheese and servers dumped additional butter and sour cream which at my fervent request was at least put on the side so i didn�t have to eat the sides my first course was a caesar salad that consisted of lettuce onto which a bottle of bottled salad dressing was dumped

the best thing about the meal was the onion bread it came out promptly well before i ever got anything to drink warm and with butter on the side

service was really amateurish there wasn�t one instance when i wanted something that i didn�t have to flag someone down � which when you�re spending $125 us per person for lunch is unacceptable it took 15 minutes alone � and several nudges � to get the wait staff to bring the bottled water we ordered two tries to get the check and get this morton�s adds an extra 10 percent on top for service few restaurants in china do that and i�ll say that it�s audacious because the level of service was so poor, mortons steakhouse is a place you never regret going to while it may be a bit pricey the quality of the food and service are worth the bill

meat burger or steak is a must although if there is something my 7 years old daughter craves for there it is lobster bisque salads are also really taste

my only regret is i am full by the times desserts are to be ordered so i usually do not try them, if you are looking for a great steak and good wine list in shanghai look no further mortons is your place  good international wine list is a little bit expensive but when paired with the right steak cant go wrong, amazing steak and great service since i was traveling alone i just sat in the bar area ive had their burger as well and is highly recommended a great steak is difficult to find in this part of the world but you wont be disappointed here, mortons in ifc is my go to spot for a good martini in shanghai
you would think that this is easy  tell you what it is not as easy in shanghai
1 some bars even high end spot does not know how to make vodka martini and i do speak chinese
2 some bars does not have rightfresh stuff to make it right
3 some bars just cheap on the liquor
after years and many visits mortons ifc remains the spot albeit the price went up and all but the quality remains

besides they opened a patio spot in the good day weather it is a nice spot, went to mortons on a walk by whim whilst touring the ifc in shanghai so glad we did my family and i were seated promptly with very little wait time for mom  dad we ordered the big porterhouse for 2 and cold seafood array includes lobster crab shrimp cocktails  yummy oysters on the shell for the kids there was a specialty chicken meal big enough for 2 that came with a really scrumptious sauce  large seasoned egg noodle side  veggies the food was truly superb and we ate every bit for dessert kids had sundaes the wife creme brulee  i had the key lime pie absolutely fantastic sure its a bit pricey at mortons but for the quality of the delicious food  great service it was totally worth it

now for the kicker i would like to extend my personal thanks  deep gratitude to mr bill lu captain and the assistant manger ms rita wu for not only their warm  friendly tableside manners checking on us periodically to make sure we were happy  well cared for but i was so flattered  astonished that bill took it upon himself to offer me  the family a courtesy ride back to the fairmont hotel across the river after we finished our meal he was so kind and very generous to do this as i believe it may be a service reserved for certain special vips who frequent their establishment so my family and i deeply appreciated this gesture as we had been on our feet most of the day before came there

my hat goes off with a deep bow to you personally bill   of course rita too you made our dinner experience the very best one we had during the week we stayed in shanghai in fact i dont recall ever receiving such unexpectedly awesome service anywhere in the world ive ever been before you guys are the best

you can be sure that whenever i visit shanghai in the future whether on business or pleasure i will be coming back each time to mortons to see you guys  enjoy the lovely atmosphere delicious food  friendly service that makes you feel like family

to all readers go here  enjoy yourselves you will not be disappointed

thank you bill  rita  thank you , excellent meat that comes with a very good service it is not cheap not remotely but the set menus are good and affordable if you are a carnivore in the streets of shanghai you should try this, a grand steakhouse the service is very welcoming and the decor is very cozy a great experience for foodies, we went there last weekend to try to erase the previous experience that was not so good anyway we totally failed the place was clean but the forks and knives completely dirty really nasty food residues on them we found finger prints all over the place in knives spoons glasses and dishes we asked to exchanged them then the food the lobster bisque is simply flavorless and the meat overcooked and burnt for a medium term it is clear that they dont know how to cook the meat we ordered 3 rib cuts and all of them were burnt the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what you can really get it doesnt really worth it not recommendable at all, ambience and view 
it is a huge restaurant in a premium mall shanghai ifc mall located beside ritz carlton hotel if you get seated further inside you get to see the oriental pearl tv tower through tall large windows the setting is suitable for both couples and families best to make reservations prior to get better seating by the windows and avoid disappointment

tip1 the best time is to go for dinner arrive around 5 plus to get seated and see the tower light up from 6 pm onwards see it change colors as you eat through your dinner this way you get to soak in the view of the oriental tv tower in the daylight as well as see it transition into the evening and see lights from the tower come alive

food  service 
the food i had is of high quality and taste but do beware prices match its level too ie high for just myself one person dining on just one soup a main and a glass of wine it already set me back by over rmb 800

renown as a steak house with an extensive range of beef cuts but alternate choices are available from seafood lamb chicken etc see menu pix attached

i was very satisfied with my selection for dinner which included 
 lobster bisque soup extremely delicious with intense flavor and not too salty
 lamb chop medium well done recommended comes with side dish of mint sauce
 glass of merlot
alongside the dinner they serve you nice large warm bread and butter for your serving of carbohydrates and keep you calm from hunger pangs while you wait for your orders to be cooked and served

tip2  if you are a carnivorous type of eater and enjoy beef take the opportunity to choose the cuts you like i�m sure the service staff can help give advice on your selection for a gratifying meal to your preferences

location  contact 
morton�s is located within shanghai ifc mall adjoined to ritz carlton pudong shanghai the shop  1516 on level 4 no8 century avenue
phone  86216075 8888, had lunch here by chance on a friday very worthwhile
a rib eye steak with a salad for starters the salad in itself could have been a main steak was not bad but i would have preferred a thicker cut but very worthwhile at rmb318
free fresh bread lovely service would recommend for lunch, i take huge issue that i just paid 17200 usd for a new york steak shrimp cocktail and a side dish and no drinks secondly when i checked the exchange rate it was 10 usd higher than what it should have been and a service charge of 15 usd  on top of that there is no landry rewards here still i have been coming here for 5 years now but why am i paying double in this restaurant and zero rewards  its gouging and outrageous double , went here earlier in the month dont eat beef so was a little sceptical  but then there was nothing else worth it in the mall saw its sign everyday walking to work while i was visiting shanghai

we entered from the back entrance and were seated within 30 seconds 2 of us

we ordered 1 salad 2 mains 3 glasses of wine and a dessert dont remember the bill but suffice to say agree with someof the other reviews  it was a bit pricey

i had the sea bass fillet if my memory serves me correct in any case it was fish it melted in my mouth outstanding

the service was impeccable with a smile

excellent service outstanding food but expensive  should have got a 4 but the service was just too good, i find the prices too high compared to other top restaurants in the area i dont know other mortons locations in the world to compare with the food is fine for a top restaurant the service is flawless the view toward the oriental pearl is eyecatching maybe if i had been a fan of steakhouses i would have liked this place more, well lets say the steak was good rib eye service was okay not great as you would expect from such a high class or high priced restaurant atmosphere was not really great view on the pearl tower was nice but overall the pricequality balance was not good i paid almost 150 euro for one steak a salade and two beers and some bread bit ridiculous anyway, we didnt plan to visit it but came across it in out walk through the mall the heart of palm salad was really nice the cesar salad was ok good service and nice atmosphere, we had a beautiful clear night in shanghai to enjoy the deck at mortons at ifc the bar was not busy at all and the restaurant was about 12 full on a sunday 6pm reservation the service from start to finish for our dinner was terrible it started with the mistake of two glasses of wine and not the bottle we ordered as well we waiting entirely too long to just get service then to get any water refills was a true effort as know one checked on our table we finally then received our entrees and my daughter who ordered a caesar salad and scallops was served much later than all of us then never got her salad we literally had to get up to get attention to finally get the salad as well we continually had to wave arms and flag down the service to get anything refilled the food as always at mortons is good but for a western restaurant that charges a very high dollar amount we were extremely disappointed in our meal for a special meal the service was unacceptable we will not be spending our money here again in shanghai, came here for dinner after a long day at work we found a nice atmosphere and large setting room is larger than the mortons in hk and quite similar size to the one in macau food was good and found a nice selection of wine good quality, the happy hour exists but the free steak sandwiches do not the drinks are all <u+00a5>45 but chocolate martini and apple martini are no longer on the happy hour drink menu
without the steak sandwiches its just not the same big disappointment and guess what it was nearly empty
come on morgans bring them back, morton�s is one of our favorites whether for business or personal dining the staff are very attentive and give excellent service the food is always great tasting the steaks are excellent one of our favorites is the grilled asparagus drizzled in balsamic vinaigrette the mondayfriday happy hour is always a great way to start the evening, great martini bar with streak sliders foe appetizers followed by wonderfully cooked usda steaks served by just fabulous people i come here every trip to hk shanghai pu dong does well despite no us beef toronto is almost as good as hk, every time i go to mortons i can find the usual good quality of food and service some people say its boring however sometimes during business appointments consistency is a key factor of success
to enjoy a nice steak perfectly done at your requested point can lead your dinner to an appropriate mood for concluding such a desire business

althoug its not a budget place from time to time i enjoy with my family the best steakhouse in asia, i never write a review logged in just to write this one worst service ever wine arrived late salad was horrible my wife and i shared a bonein ribeye and it was the worst steak ever it tasted like plastic and to finish the night i got food poisoned my first meal in shanghai i lived in usa for 17 years and been to many steak houses this was he worst one in my 37 years, we booked a private dining room for a business meeting and dinner the room overlooked the new area of shanghai and won me a lot of points with my customers everyone was posing for pictures with the view
we ordered appetisers from the bar menu and enjoyed hors doeuvres for an hour before sitting down to dinner 3 courses and several bottles of wine later everyone was complimenting me on one of the finest meals they ever had definitely the best place possible for an impressive business dinner, i visit mortons regularly for its great steaks extensive wine selection and above all quality service, one of the top three steak restaurants with a very good wine selection perfect location at the center of lu jia zui shanghai a little bit pricey though, wide wine selection with reasonable price the view is great and you could chill out in the terrace prime rib is good just need to pre order, outstanding quality of food  but watching the chinese eating only 35 on their plates and sending the rest to the kitchen for the waste before they take the next plate and so on  is a terrible nightmare
i cant see this any more  a dog usually has better education, always exceed my expectations this is a world class steak house a home away from home for americans, high quality steak and big portion good and very nice service the free bread is impressive good taste, the first time that i ate at mortons was before 10 years at hong kong from then when i am in hong kong always i have dinner there this time i tried the mortons in shanghai the food is very good like hong kong the service not bad but dont like hong kong, this review is based on their happy hour the mortini happy hour gives you different choices of cocktails wine or beer for 45 rmb with their unlimited filet mignon sandwhiches i ordered a cosmopolitan was defnitely disappointed on how sweet the drink was and had barely or no alcohol at all in addition their unlimited filet mignon was a complete gimmick i got there at 5pm and the sandwhiches was not served till 545pm there was no tower of sandwhiches there was just a tray of it since they only sent out 1 tray in an hour for their 57pm happy hour its mostly only 23 small 2 bite sandwhiches the sandwhich itself was unsatisfying the bread they used was hawaiiwan style bread which was a sweet bread the filet mignon meat look like burnt trimmings from their steak since all i tasted was really hard chewy bitter beef the sanwhich was so dry no flavor not really worth the happy hour deal is the sandwhich good for alcohol snacks not at all not even worth the calories on how teribble it tasted lastly the service here was weird there were 5 tables with guest during the happy hour and only one table had a good service this one waiter went over and beyond to treat the guest in this table to have a good time however he did not visit the other tables nor there was other waiters giving us this type of service so it was definitely weird overall the service here felt noneexistant

definitely would not go back to this place, just fantabulous
service outstanding food outstanding
first time for my chinese friend  he loved it thank you frederic, located in a quite eccentric shopping mall the food and the drinks are really up to the standard of any mortons of chicago franchise anywhere in the world we have been many times in business and family dinners and you can never go wrong with the service the ambiance the food i tried from the hamburger to any of the rib eyes and porterhouse and the flavor were formidable do not get too much on the appetizers so you can also enjoy their dessert line up","dumpling restaurant",0.999756362568745
207,"i enjoyed the hu nan food here i had a cold dish of cucumbers with garlic i also ordered black fungus with tofu sheet and an eggplant dish the service is top notch they have a small eta menu that is very good for being so small i had a very tasty green oolong tea, ive stayed here many times since it opened 2 12 years ago excellent service provided by all staff the restaurants are great ive eaten in the chinese  western rooms are very well done  comfortable located about 15 30 mins from the action in a cab, we asked our concierge for a recommendation for something spicy and chinese and he recommended this place great recommendation lots of interesting options on the menu including sea cucumber pig stomach etc etc but also plenty of tamer options for the less brave ie us we had a beautiful hot pumpkin based fish soup spicy bullfrog legs some sort of stir fried chicken with tons of chilli several beautifully presented little starters and it was all lovely not much english spoken but the menu had english so that wasnt a problem and very helpful adn friendly staff busy bustling place nicely fitted out, this is my goto place in shanghai whenever i dont know what to eat celebrate or just hook up with a friend over great food guyi is it 

guyi specializes in hunanstyle which is one of the eight great traditions of chinese cuisine known for its hot spicy flavors fresh aromas and deep colors  and believe me guyi delivers all of it, dinner with work mates including both nonvegetarian and vegetarian excellent options to satisfy culinary satisfaction for both we ordered a couple dishes that are typically served with meat preparation but requested vegetarian option staff was happy to accommodate, we went to the guyi outlet at jiu guang department store it was not as busy for dinner as we expected and we got a table for 5 without reservations

though we didnt go for the fiery ones the dishes we ordered were good enough to leave a deep impression on the food quality standouts were the garland chrysanthemum salad braised pork and yellow croaker soup with preserved vegetables

we waited quite a while for the dishes to come out and when one of the waiters found out he apologized and gave us a free appetizer that was a cool gesture

service was excellent food was excellent a mustgo if you are near jing an temple, service taste and food qualities rose with price for the last 10years its still one of the best hunan food restaurant in puxi and is highly recommended
booking is necessary, the food here appeared to decline a while back when i wrote my last review i went here recently and was pleasantly surprised it seems the taste is back and the prices are up the best hunan chinese ribs zi ran pai gu in town here are much more expensive than before and taste nice i would definitely recommend bringing people here its a great place, normally we will visit this restaurant at least once whenever we are in shanghai for business or leisure  i have visited two times during month of november 2015 and as usual serve us the great spicy and delicious hunan cuisine  i love the steam fish head here about to finish can ask waiter for noddle and mix with it  so good and tasty  other foods are great too and we also booked a private dinning room here, excellent hunanrestaurant with interesting interiordesign  rich choice on the menucard  very good service  reasonable prices  nice place to relax and enjoy my favourite recommendation spicy lambsticks with cunmin + 1 cold tigerbeer , are a lunch here and was pleased to find it busy and being most filled with noneuropeans the lack of english was an issue perhaps because of this as none of us spoke mandarin ordering was no problem due to pictures and guessing however for more specific things it was too difficult � so them telling us we had to move tables as they had a bigger party coming was a lot of confusion simply down to the communication aside from this the service was not quite as sharp as i would have liked � with me chasing some dishes and struggling to get water etc food was very good though with good heat and flavor throughout price understandably a bit higher than normal but mostly worth it, based upon the recommendation of the concierge at the puli hotel four of us dined at guyi our first night in shanghai we were not disappointed after some difficulty getting a server to our table and then ordering by pointing english was limited among the staff and mandarin was nonexistent at our table food started coming out in waves virtually everything was delicious visually attractive spicy complex subtle and satisfying the cumin crusted spareribs were total pork goodness there is also another guyi location in a shopping center about 12 mile from the original location to round out our experience we are heading there on our last night in shanghai for more details on the food itself read the blog by our travelling companion at wwwmyplateoryourstypepadcom, first night in shanghai and we scored with this one ribs bristling with cumin seeds vegetable wok pot flavorful and delicious excellent duck dish and chicken with bamboo shoots scallion pancakes to die for initial service was a little erratic  we were the only westerners there and presented a challenge as no one had much english and we had zero chinese  but once we managed to order the food came fast and hot excellent choice, i totally not agree that their food quality is getting downthis place is still the first chinese restaurant to invite your guest for a chinese treat best chinese spicy food and ribs from hunan, the rumors are true guyi has declined the decor the service the ambiance are still there but the food has grown bland and boring even the famous ribs are no longer pungent spicy or complex i think the restaurant has let the good chef go i would not recommend this place anymore, a shanghai native recommended this restaurant and we were not disappointed the place was packed on the night we visited but service did not suffer the staff did not speak much english but were eager to please and we were able to get by with some english and pictures on the menu food quality was excellent and a good value, we have been here last year as well and the quality of the food is still great nice restaurant typical local hunan food, some work colleagues and i were here for dinner about a week ago and we were very happy with the meal and service that we received

obviously the food was local and authentic and we enjoyed our dishes very much but i also noted that the service was good compared to a lot of restaurants in china where it can be lacking by western standards

i would recommend this restaurant for a socialbusiness dinner and i would return again, if you like spice you cant go wrong dishes are well done and nicely presented service for china standards is good i agree with many guests that the cumin ribs are outstanding but at times they have been a bit overdone the mapu dofu is outstanding if your guest is male then its a winner order ribs and chops i personally dont like the hot n sour soup as it had a lot of ducks blood not one of my favorites i will be going back to this restaurant many many times i have been about 20 times already but as i said i have lived in shanghai a long time, if you are looking for a chinese restaurant both favorite of locals and expats this is the place i like spicy food and this place hits the spot with its sometime too much spicy food that might get you crybe prepared to quee no matter which day of the week consistently good business due to its consistently good food and serviceprices are from medium to highrecommend, mid price hunan food serving the standards well well priced there are numerous restaurants all over shanghai great hunan food the ribs are amazing the fish head steamed to perfection with the usual spices we went to the one in the ifc mall and another next to the dr beer on fumin road bth were consistent and delivered great food good service if you want local fare done well this is it, i had not heard of that restaurant before and got invited there by a couple of friends it turned to be a very nice experience
the food is excellent prices are reasonable and the waiters are welltrained

if you are looking for a good chinese restaurant dont hesitate but careful it can get crowded, guyi has an excellent location next to dr beer on fumin road so after dinner you could easily grab a drink with friends there or dr wine liquid laundry monkey lounge etc the food itself was yummy and spicy  but out of all of the hunan places to choose from this wouldnt be at the top its a bit pricier too so if you want a more fancy experience to show your parents or colleagues this is a good option but for excellent food try hunan rural restaurant on wulumuqi or even di shui dong on maoming good luck, great food and pleasant decor  we recommend trying the cumin ribs we had to ask for them specially since there were pork ribs on the menu and cumin lamb on the menu but nothing that combined cumin and pork they accommodated us easily with a little help from my chinese dictionary the meat just fell right off the bone with crunchy whole cumin seeds adding a delciious and unique flavor good times, you can always tell a decent restaurant by the queue out of the door we had to wait 20 mins or so but well worth it spicy chicken pot ultra hot squid hot pot and the experience of steamed bull frogs legs a very memorable meal, the restaurant doesnt take dinner reservations and we were put on a standby list instead we arrived at about 7pm but still had to wait for about 45 minutes as far as ambience goes the restaurant itself is modern and clean but otherwise cramped we were dining elbow to elbow with the people beside us and smelled the doors to the kitchen were left open the whole time we were there and the whole restaurant ended up smelling quite unpleasant

weve never had hunan food before but thought the food here was pretty good compared with the other cuisines weve had in mainland china the darksauce pork belly with eggs and pork ribs are great choices be prepared for extra spicy but slightly sweet fare service is very average and our teapot was never filled up despite constant reminders

would i return probably but only if i am seated immediately and am here with friends who want to dine here otherwise guyi is not worth the wait ive had better meals in shanghai, we were recommended this place by a frenchman at the china art museum  bless his soul we were fed up of oily street food by now  and this proved to be a gem very lively atmosphere and a very cosmopolitan clientele  great dishes with lots of chillisthe only disappointing dish being the salt egg prawn which was delicious but every other prawn wasnt a prawn it was a turnip in batter
we both ate for forty pounds which was very good value for the amount we ate and they served till quite late which was unusual in shanghai
seriously recommended, pigs feet was really tender and tastefully done well the flavoring was well put together the fish  clams was great as well but be careful for the small bones in the fish highly recommended, it took about half an hour for the first item we ordered to arrive which seemed excessive the other two items arrived at 15 minute intervals after that
the farmers hotpot meat was ok but if it wasnt for all the chillis would have been bland the duck hot pot was very chewy
the place was very crowded saturday night and it was certainly very competitively priced considering the nice table cloths high level of service although it is a shame that when a table is cleared the waiters arrive with a washing bowl to take everything away
all in all we had a filling but not very special meal, we went to the branch at ifc mall because it was the closest one to get to on the metro it was lateish 8pm so we didnt have to wait for a table service was smart and fast and extremely friendly

as others have said the cumin ribs are to die for a must order we also had some duck hotpot a boiled egg curry delicious and i am going to try this at home the most amazing fish dish cant remember which variety 3 whole small fish lightly fried and unbelievably spiced so fresh we also tried their dumplings good steamed and filled with more vegies than the shanghainese vareity and some fried rice hunan style which was lighter and greener than the others we had tried around town filled with chunks of preserved porkyum they were a bit gobsmacked by how much food we ordered you have to if you want to try as many things as possible but we ate most of it definitely would go back there in a heartbeat, they dont seem to take reservations so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table it was definitely worth the wait the food is really good spicy and flavorful in addition to the chicken and beef we had bullfrog not a favorite and fish head the fish head was delicious i highly recommend even for those who are squeamish at the thought really lovely meal, i visited guyi with my girlfriend after a friend living in shanghai recommended it

the food was very nice fresh tasting in particular i can recommend the cumin ribs and lamb chops

the service we received was very poor and spoilt the meal for us we ordered four dishes and whilst eating the first three to arrive a woman who i assume was the manager handed us our bill and asked us to pay straight awayeven though we were still eating also the bill showed that our last dish had been refunded when we asked the manager why it was taken off she told us they had run out no effort had been made to point this out earlier so we could have ordered something else and the manager wasnt apologetic in the slightest her only concern was collecting our money

overall a very disappointing meal, my wife and i are regulars here the menu is huge with lots of pictures which is great for a laowai foreigner typically we get the cold cucumbers to start the fried fish spicy chicken in a wood bowl and then try to experiment with different options we havent tried the bowls with boiling dishes in them yet but last time we were there almost everyone in the restaurant was ordering them

for under $30 a person you can get a very good selection of food with a few beers its a great experience i definitely recommend a visit here, my boyfriend and i were visiting a friend in shanghai and he recommended the place all i can say is wow the portions were amazing and the food was so good if you are used to chinese food in the us then this is completely different and will definitely surprise you fish heads and jelly fish yes please, guyi is a shanghai institution when it comes to hunan food for that reason it has been in the same spot for years doing a roaring trade theyve finally made it a bit more foreign friendly and in addition to the well lit and noisy interior they now have a small outside alfresco dining deck watch out for mozzies at certain times of the year i love hunan and have a definite taste for the food and guyi offers the real deal without cutting corners this does mean spice levels for many foreigners are way off the scoville chart even if not really any chiliheads should come here as first stop in shanghai but it is not just about heat the dishes are highly complex in flavour and varied the ribs are a signature dish of hunan meanwhile the minority group tujia soup is absolutely sensational  be warned this soup is not for the faint of heart i was the only person out of four that could have it and well i finished the pot it was so good on the other hand i felt like the tip of a benzene burner afterwards reservations highly recommended big portions excellent value, this restaurant offer a good selection of hunnanese dished not too spicy  you can choose the level of spicyness beef and vegetalbe are really tasty and well done do not choose the higest spicy level casue the medium is already enough in case you hsve the possibility to add this falvour with the set of spicy on the table portions are good not too big so thatyou can choose and try different kind of food best to order all to share place is nice and service quite well done compared to other chinese restaurnat average, there is very little to say excellent no hesitation or but the menu is vast the food very tasty service was good there are 4 branches and we are going to try their century avenue branch next time strongly recommended, excellent hunanese cuisine and great value for money all the dishes were good but the standout by far was the ribs a great recomendation from lonely planet service was exemplary, i was lucky to be visiting with chinese friends so i did not experience the service a typical english speaking person would be sure to order the fish head if you have never had this before the beef and mushroom pot hot was unbelievable, this restaurant does not try to help non emglish speaking customers food was indifferent the service pathetic and the staff could not care less if we were taken care of the food arrived very slowly and the rice came after we were done eating the food is mild by us standards and they charged even for hot chili sauce absolutely a bust, i love this restaurant to such extent that i have a selfimposed requirement that i have to eat there every time i visit shanghai most often on the same day that i arrive i would consider the cuisine hunan light its not as fire engine hot as dishuidong in the french concession but im sure they can make it hotter if you ask them to my favorite appetizer is the handmade dumplings and my favorite main course is the filet fried beef with prawn the mutton chops with cumin and the stirfried liver with red chili are also excellent a full meal including tea but not alcohol will run between 150 and 200 yuan per person

although the restaurant has two locations in shanghai i prefer the one the 8th floor jiuguang no 1618 west nanjing road because it is easier to get to by metro simply take metro line 2 to jingan temple go out metro exit 2 and then take the escalator to the 8th floor of the shopping center there are other restaurants on that floor so walk around it until you find guyi the other location of guyi is in the french concession area i was at that location only once it was harder to get to by metro more of a walk from the metro station and although the food was as good as the jingan temple location it didnt have the same ambiance guyi is always crowded and i have always had to wait for a table but it is well worth it, i like spicy food so guyi is perfect do try the ribs and the fish head get your beer ready and go to battle, so many years and this place is still my preferite hunan restaurant in shanghai so good that you need to wait to seat even after 9 pm a place to try, this was my least favorite meal in shanghai it was extremely crowded and had locals which is always a good sign so maybe we just ordered wrong  we got a few hot pots one was chicken and the other had seafood like squid andor octopus i thought the food was good but compared to some of the other places we ate it wasn�t amazing, this was my second trip to guyi hunan style restaurant and it was great there is always a wait so call ahead if you can we started with the ribs appetizer and the octopus hot pot for entrees we loved the fish head in chilis and the lamb chops with cumin finished with a soup of taro and greens that was very nice as well everything is well seasoned without being too spicy will definitely be back, dined at guyi hunan last night was our first time but wont be our last food was the cleanest tasting freshest quality of any place weve tried in shanghai including the high end restaurants the menu is very easy to navigate and for once the pictures of the food actually were surpassed by the real presentation very interesting selection the cumin crusted ribs and the lamb chops are amazing with virtually no grease after our party of six devoured the ten ribs there was no greasy residue in the bottom of the basket they were served in vegetables were bright colorful crisp and delicious we ordered a mountain of food plus beers and the bill was $150 usd for 6 people with tons of food in the doggy bag which was also a pleasant experience considering the sky high prices that shanghai has escalated to, there may be better but we didnt find it i thought that guyi was not a simple hunan restaurant but a has a touch of nouvelle in it as well great menu with lots of interesting choices the cumin crusted lambchops were great as was the eggplant and really everything we tried a definite step up from in the areas of decor tablecloths cloth napkins which was nice after having good food in more downscale places the happy staff was great some local rock stars or actors came late for china and it was a fun night if its the weekend make reservations price was correct for the quality of the food they take credit cards, visited this restaurant for the first time last night and was very impressed ribs and shrimp were stand out but to be honest all of the food was delicious  given the number of restaurants in shanghai there is no need to ever go back but this is one i will definitely visit again, the food is absolutely great love the variety you can never get tired of the food its so good that we bring guest there all the time its a must visit for tourist my friends and i go there at least once a month, this has to be more than 10 visits ive made to this lovely restaurant in shanghai they serve great hunanszechuan dishes not anymore  i placed orders for my usual dishes and it took them a while to get them out due to an overwhelming crowd on a saturday evening i was assisted by a young waiter who eagerly hasten the dishes for us after my female friend complimented him on his boyish good looks  i learnt something new that day anyway the dishes were poorly cooked the pork ribs did not have enough spices like it used to and the cabbage one favorite dish was extremely salty to the effect that we left it unfinished  the signature chilli fish head dish was lukewarm and tasted blend too im not sure if it was the crowd that left the kitchen shorthanded or the master chef had simply absconded  i do not wish that it was the latter i would love to try it out again but thatll be the last time should the quality remains low","bar",0.507999874070496
208,"many nice dishes greatly presented but i was there for the beijing peking duck just �excellent crispy tender and not oily, it was our second time having peking duck in dadong and it was must better than the one we had in beijing the service was better too you better make an advanced reservation we were told that it was fully booked but we could come in and wait so we did we had to wait for around 40 mins so after reserving our table we strolled outside west nanjing rd  shopping strip peking duck was excellent we liked it so much that we ordered 2 ducks amongst the 4 of us the other dishes were good too modern and fusion dessert was at high standard we really like dadong and it will be the reason for us to come back to shanghai, we came to dadong to eat beijing duck first of all the lady at the reception said its all booked even though there was literally no one in the restaurant secondly we ordered the beijing duck and they brought a tiny version of it which only had a skin and no meat at all and cost 60 dollars when we asked to change it and serve the regular duck they refused never ever coming again to this place staff  doesnt speak english, dadong is a respected name among the food landscape in china being originally from beijing and mostly famous for its beijing duck this location is inside the iapm shopping mall the interior is very modern and elegant usually you need to reserve well in advance as it is very requested we had a big round table as we were a good group of friends and we our chinese friend ordered a variety of dishes that we shared according to local use unfortunately i cannot recall the names of the dishes but i will post a number of them each being a real experience high quality ingredients and a very professional masters hand can achieve such high results they also got a michelin star true experience for our palate a must go, beautiful dishes all prepared with passion taste was all good with one comment not always warm maybe plates stand too long too be served at table menu is like a giant cooking book with great pictures really beautiful but not really convenient for choosing your diner
has not the ambiance of a west european michelin star restaurant but see my pics and decide yourself o<u+fe0f>, looking out for a modern chinese restaurant with well trained and perfectly english speaking staff  then this place is a must go the restaurant holds a michelin star and deserves it

we were a group of 8 people and enjoyed a variety of different chinese dishes including beijing duck all dishes were great  taste and presentation of dishes were perfect restaurant is stylish and modern decorated really tasty even though the restaurant was fully booked the noise level was very acceptable plates have been exchanged several times during the dinner staff is very engaged and cares well about their guests, i want to note that some of their appetizers come in per piece portions so its very friendly for the solo diner i made a reservation at 11am and they called my cellphone at 1050am as a reminder

the first dish came the iberian ham wrapped sticky rice and immediately after popping it into my mouth a taste similar to horse radish flooded my nasal passage and mouth it was excruciating i felt like a tourist trolled by a sushi chef armed with a fistful of wasabi flavor wise it was nothing special

second came the peking duck i was incredibly excited for this a chef came personally to my table and carved up a fresh duck in front of me the aroma of the duck was amazing even the fat under the skin was rendered crispy this was the mind blowing aspect of my meal

third dish the crab roe congee was bland and aside from the color i wasnt able to tell there was crab roe in it it was instagram pretty but lacking in substance

fourth dish the fried steamed bun i had was a steamed meat and mushroom bun that was panfried on the bottom it wasnt anything special it wasnt bad or bland just not worth getting at a restaurant when you can find this similar food on the smaller vendors and shops in shanghai

fifth finally the egg tart i love egg tarts and i will gorge on egg tarts any given chance so it was really difficult to save this for last it was creamy and fluffy yet the pastry was light and crisp totally worth it

complimentary end seasonal fruit on ice during my visit i got tangerines since they were in season i thought it was a nice sweet touch to my very delicious and mostly duck meal

truly deserving of its one michelin star if only for the duck i would recommend, we booked the restaurant two weeks in advance at that time we were quite rudely informed that we can only book a slot for 530pm have to arrive not later than 545pm and we have to complete the meal before 7 pm

we arrived on time and the restaurant setting was good the menu was nicely done up with chinese poems for each dish just like that in the bj restaurant i found this restaurant many years ago in bj and there was only one outlet in bj then

the duck was as good as that in bj the other food were generally of certain good standard the most disappointing thing about this restaurant is its service it did not live up to its name and expansive setting there was no greeting no smiling from the waiter and waitress food were just dumped on the table there were no changing of dirty plates no attention to us at all they are more keen to get us out to receive the second batch of dinners during our short stay there there was a commotion outside the restaurant over booking and the customer was furiously mad and that was not surprising given that the customers were not treated with respect

not a pleasant experience notwithstanding that the food were generally good, called for making a reservation the receptionist didnt understand english and rudely and simply answered no table hand up the telephone without any excuse or saying goodbye, the restaurant is posh but not too expensive for this type of meal the best peking duck in shanghai they have table side carving of the duck excellent side dishes also such as seafood and vegetables, the location i am reviewing is near jingan temple same chain from beijing and same result really great and fun roast duck i could eat the crispy skin every meal but the meat is tender and juicy as well very efficient wait staff, i preface the remarks here by mentioning that i have been to this location and to the beijing location in years past and had been previously impressed unfortunately not the case with this visit we were a party of 7 with a reservation at 5pm on a friday night the restaurant was already 25 full when we arrived its located on one of the top floors wn the luxury mall iapm

their menu is this huge and long probably 8 pounder full of text and photos  all professionally done problem began when we tried to order a bottle of prosecco which they were out of then we ordered a higher grade sauvignon blanc  out again looking at both the wine list as well as venturing to the wine storage area one can definitely see that they stock the ultra top of the line expensive stuff your usuals of opus one krug but do the staff know how to serve the same and are there other wines on the list that are available yes the prices were outrageous but it can only be an outrage if they have the same in stock menu items should be there to impress only assuming you can order the same we settled for a different bottle of white wine burt when i tasted the same it was room temperature and thus not chilled at al we asked for an ice bucket and staff quickly assisted

we ordered of course a few ducks informing them well save the bones to take home to make stock or soup which was excellently prepared and carved table side they even had a wait staff teaching the kids how to wrap the same the problem was that we tried ordering other menu food and vegetable items and on at least four occasions the wait staff came back minutes later to inform us that they were out of it this is early on a friday night simply no way to do business

when the food arrived most of the dishes were served with a grandiose presentation the portions seemed slightly smaller for the price another problem was that after we were done eating the duck and other dishes practically 1015 minutes later a final vegetable dish arrived to which we remarked whether that was our dessert

overall staff and service did well with what they had available for the price definitely not worth it, the location is in a big luxury mall i personally dont like it the famous beijing duck of dadaong becomes a quite trivial experience far from beijing service is of quality not in line with the high price wine prices are outrageous  if you want to enjoy the dadong beijing duck go to their restaurant in beijing, there are a few da dongs in shanghai that are always packed this outlet seemed less crowded as it was newer as usual mega long wait if arriving after 730 tried reserving before but depending on who picks up the phone usually its no reservations allowed

always go for the duck here if unsure what else to order order another duck chef was having some saffron themed menu so ordered a saffron tofu and saffron beef did not taste any saffron despite the high price but plating was exceptionally beautiful and food is still tasty place can range from worthwhile to super expensive so order wisely, <u+4e0a><u+6d77><u+51fa><u+5f35><u+4e2d><u+3001><u+5730><u+5143><u+306e><u+30b9><u+30bf><u+30c3><u+30d5><u+304c><u+304a><u+52e7><u+3081><u+3068><u+3044><u+3046><u+3053><u+3068><u+3067><u+3001><u+5915><u+98df><u+3092><u+98df><u+3079><u+307e><u+3057><u+305f><u+3002>

the dish was not traditional chinese cuisine but fancy cuisine
the chef used the ingredient of the western vesitables and
arrenged the fruit of a stem of the okra vegetables strawberries
and the raspberries with 
we had crunchy structure fun was able to enjoy the latest dish
it was the best dinner  thats hot , this restaurant is located on the sixth floor of a very highend shopping mall it is beautifully decorated and even the menus are mini works of art the dishes ordered were served in impeccable fashion service throughout was attentive and generally first rate the peking duck was carved at the table which added a touch of theatre to the dinner the other dishes were really enjoyable well prepared and presented this really is a must visit restaurant if you want to savour local style fine dining in shanghai although you may have to wait for a table as it is clearly very popular, spent a fun evening with a large group of work colleagues whilst i enjoyed to food there was something about the restaurant that did work for me felt at times i was being judged by the wait staff for example was left with no plate when the duck arrived had to ask for one to be responded to with a loud tut  was folding the pancake for the duck incorrectly and was almost pushed out of the way as they did it for me  it looked perfectly ok to me  i am probably being overly sensitive

some intriguing food on the menu  goose liver with cooked hawthorn and also some delicious salmon and vegetable salad deep fried meat balls was not fond of the black truffle soup  exceedingly rich and thick everyone comes for the duck which was good but in my mind not the best thing on the menu, nice restaurant nice furniture great view fully booked so book early or go there and stand in line which we did and it took 40 minutes before we got a table
the roasted duck is excellent however all dishes we ordered was very good some of the staff speaks english bot not good enough so we did have a few problems when we asked for clarifications in the menu
i do recommend this restaurant if you want to eat roasted duck and excellent asian food, no need to go to beijing for a traditional pequin duck dadong has it all
an upscale environment with extremely attentive service the food is outstanding and you can tell it is prepared by culinary chefs and not regular cooks spices and seasoning are perfect dish presentation is like you see in fancy magazines and the pequin duck ahhhh the pequin duck you have to try it goose liver pate is served in a small ball that looks like a red cherry very good, went to this newish shanghai shopping mall called iapm and went to da dong restaurant which is a branch of the renowned beijing based peking duck restaurant chain the service was firstclass and the restaurant setting very pleasant food was good and plentiful and we even asked for a doggy back to take back to the hotel can only recommend this restaurant and also the shopping mall itself theres also a din tai fung in this shopping mall but i didnt eat there so cant comment, went to this restaurant for a birthday party the restaurant looks very nice the tables very nicely decorated looks all very fancy the menu has the duck but also a lot of ver nice vegetables i really liked the asperges and the eggplant i normally do not like to eat duck at all but the duck here is thin sliced and you put it together with some vegetables and different sauces garlic sugar and some i dont know the name of in a very thin bread or pancake which makes it really delicious a really good place to take guests to try to eat beijing duck, serve very good quality beijing roast duck in shanghai  i usually do not want to have beijing roast duck other than in beijing due to poor experience on quality of food served  but this one is unbelievable good 

i do go to dadong restaurant in beijing and love their quality of roast duck  here shanghai can serve as good as those in beijing , like beijing duck this is a great place to go tasty well prepared ducks with all what is needed around modern design restaurant with professional service timely polite accurate and not obtrusive enjoy it when you are in shanghai, the peking duck was fantastic the skin simply melts in your mouth the chef were very skillfulland slice the meat infront of us as for the remaining meat they ask if we want to pack or change with duck soup we also order other dishes and were totally satisfied with the food and their services whole peking duck cost rmb288 for 34 person if u want good view make reservation especially dinner time it is very crowded we chose lunch and the restaurant is quite pack too","Italian cuisine",0.9998267372787
209,"absolutely love it
this is the second time ive been to qimin hotpot and ive loved both times
the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting the service is friendly and happy the whole place is a freeforall of food and noise from the a staff member shouting out a chant and all the rest shouting it back ala seattle fish markets to the diners trying to join in
when you are seated big long tables with sunken heating elements for your hotpot the seats are covered with a apron of sorts and if you put your jacket over the back of the chair the apron is then pulled over it to protect when they do this you know it can get messy literately
the menu is pretty basic you choose a soupstock flavor then everything you want to cook in it vegetable noodles tofu sliced beef mouths watering recalling all this seafood on  on  on sooo much to choose from
then you go to the condiment selection and choose the added flavours to complete the whole thing garlic sesame oil soy chilli paste crushed chilli oil sliced chillis etc you get the picture
your pot turns up and the power is turned on then one after another the platters turn up and you start and just keep going

delicious, the location decor service and food quality all exceptional great place to gather with friends and enjoy your own little hot pot experience each person chooses their own broth so we each picked a differed t one and shared with each other, i have been wanting to try qimin for the longest time and finally did i was not disappointed i just wished i had done it sooner they offer delicious soup bases fresh meats and vegs and a great dipping sauce station, another visit and certainly worth the effort to come to this joint for hot pot i love their sambal inspired chili paste
food is great and fresh and worth the experience, delicious fresh and high grade ingredients fun environment excellent service a unique experience, this hot pot is the most filling and satisfying in shanghai the soup bases are light and healthy and the food is fresh, 2nd visit and the food was just amazing again service was also excellent and this is a must try place for all the great food

not the cheapest but certainly the food quality makes up for it, i had a great experience while having dinner here the ingredients are so fresh tasted great also they have this tree grown mushroom menu where you can cut the mushrooms by yourself and it was one the softest mushroom texture ive had the waitress was very kind and explained to us all of our questions one by one patiently definitely recommended, qimin organic hotpot was closed for almost a year but opened again at the reel mall it is really a cool place to see a nice shop with the products and great food im a fan of the mushrooms that come on a small tree but all other food is great too i took a large seafood bowl and that was really good, i love hotpot and this place really hit the spot
lovely soup bases fresh meats vegetables seafood etc also very uniquely presented service was also very good
definitely worth a try if you are in this part of the woods
note its not the cheapest but the quality is worth it, apart from the good hotpot and organic food the restaurant featured games where guests could take part get free beer and dishes very nice overall experience will comeback again, let me be honest i love hotpot ive lived in shanghai for a decade and eaten my fair share of lamb tofu and beef coming up from the boiling pot
i recently tried this place on the top floor at the reel department store and fell in love instantly its 100 organic the decor is great service nice though could be better and i always prefer the individual hotpot version to the shared all to my liking
the meat was in a class of its own ive never had better meat at a hotpot restaurant in china
i can highly recomend eating at qimin and i will be back
the only drawback is the limited tofu options i love good tofu skin tofu nuts fluffy tofu etc they had one of this, located on the 4th floor of reel shopping centre this place is nearly always full during the traditional early dinner hours  but dont walk awayits really worth waiting to get a table besides which theres a minimart within the entrance area that sells fresh organic fruits and vegetablesand theres also dried goods and frozen foods worth checking out

weve been here a few times now and each time theres something new on the menu
inside the restaurant there are two long tables with each position having its own stove and controls there are also 3 separate tables seating 4 one table that seats 6and then theres seating for singles by one of the kitchens the ceiling above the main seating area is festooned with washing lines full of peggedup clothes  very colourful

the menu is really quite easy to navigate overall but wed recommend you avoid the starters shown in the first couple of pagesgo right to ordering your broth theres a choice of 8 and we generally choose the mongolianstyle broth or the matsutake mushroom chicken broth theres also a good selection of thinly sliced meatsthe qimin special beef platter provides a selection of 3 different cuts and is enough but you can also explore inner mongolian grassfed lamb or snowflake pork or matsuaka porkand others

but its in the seafood section where it really excels in choiceand the seasonal seafood platter more of an ice mountain laden with goodies is good value and has a nice selection the seafood lollipops ground seafood on a stick are really goodand there was one which was orange flavoured which was wonderful another delight was the fennel and squid paste served a big ball on a little wooden platter  you can then create portions to your own liking with the little wooden spoon accompanying this treat

actually all the balls wontons dumplings and pastes are goodwhether fishseafood or meat if youre after tofu there is a good selection but these are listed on the last page of the menu but unfortunately this is one of the few pages which is chinese only

but the real fun comes when you choose vegetablesthis time we chose self harvest fresh pea sprouts and a box covered with pea sprouts accompanied with garden scissors arrived but theres a great choice of organic greens to be had then theres the mushroomsthese are presented growing on sticks in terracotta potsor simply part of a branch scattered with live mushrooms fantastic

they have some very interesting juice concoctions and beverages in general last night they also had a wine promotioneach of the wines they had in their minimart were on special for rmb 99 per bottleand we chose a montepulciano dabbruzzo which was fruity and yummy and perfect to balance the spicechillies we had in our dipping sauces after dinner we went back to the minimart and bought 3 more bottles to take home btw i dont think they run this special all the time

one last pointthere is an extensive selection of condiments on a side baryou have to go there and make up your own dipping sauce

the service is excellent  they care about what they are doing and your enjoyment many of the staff speak english in varying levels so dont be afraid to ask

great placefun placereally nice","bar",0.80218874708491
21,"my family came on a trip to china and one of the recommended places for views of the bund was char at indigo hotel
we decided to go for dinner which was a great decision instead of just going to the bar we had several appetizzers to share which we thoroughly enjoyed and the staff was very attentive and welcoming
for the main course we had their meat degustation in which we tried different cuts all cooked perfectly to medium rare as per our request and the beef quality was outstanding i really enjoyed the fact they take the meat course seriously as they offer special knives and salts which made dinner quite interesting
chef came out after the main course and also introduced dessert this was a great plus as well since he wanted to ensure our dining experience had been satisfactory and it certainly was
would definitely come back on a special ocassion, incredible views well worth a visit when in shanghai go as the sun goes down pricey but very good really chilled good music, business friend brought me to this restaurant food was so so and the service could be better for the price we are paying for, the experience was very good  char has magnificent views of the city the quality of the meat was exceptional and the fact that head chef came out to our table was a nice touch the only downside is char is pricey  really pricey and i say that has someone who doesnt mind paying good money for a highquality dining experience ordered the apple dessert which was amazing but word of warning that it did take a very long time to come out overall char delivers a very good meal with a significant bill at the end, cant fault the service the quality of food the location  its all really quite good

from my experience only 4 out of 5 due to the price its an impressive meal and a good experience but it is a bit over priced, starter lobster bisque and salad cesars in a creative style were good but the steak as a main course was prepared rather well than medium even though it was ordered medium rare that should not happen in a high price steak place like this dessert apple tartine and creme brulee was very good again, char is a perfect place to eat with a very nice view we ate oysters who were fantastic and a wagyu meat that was also very good the chef is amazing and i really recommend this place definitely i will come back, we frequently dine at the restaurants all around the bund and we sometimes feel some of them rely too much on the views char has probably the best view of them all but also it is one of the best dinning experiences in shanghai

cozy place with a nice atmosphere and we were looked after very well home made bread and cuts were definitely the best

it is pricey especially if you are generous with wine but still totally worth it, char boasts the best view in shanghai of the skyline from its rooftop bar on the bund this is a remarkable location that offered us a clear nights view while enjoying champagne and oysters at bar while taking in the light show that is a signature of shanghai we followed up our time at the bar with an outstanding dinner at char the chef personally visited with us and designed a menu for us to enjoy the best cuts of meat the perfect sides and seasonings this is a must visit restaurant in this vibrant city, as we stayed at the indigo hotel during chinese new year we also visited the char bar the decor is a mix of vintage glitz and glamour with dark wood artsy pictures and glitter on the pillows the rooftop seating area was a fantastic lookout on the bund the huangpu river and pudong one of the best views weve had so far and great for taking skyline photos the service was okay we had to go to the bar to order the drinks selection could be a bit better and the menu was very expensive cheapest cocktails were 95 rmb and of course  a service charge will be added to your bill, good food great choice of steaks very cosy place with superb views we will enjoy going back there once in shanghai again, this place was good from top to toe the meat was so soft when you cut it the waiter was well educated so you learn 1 or 2 things you had to such with knife aswell, the restaurant is situated high up and most abel have a fantastic view of the bund and shanghai city  which is stunning

the service was excellent and the menu choice is huge

i ate the crab cakes to start and the grilled king prawns for the main  all of which was presented really well and extremely tasty

the bill came to circa <u+00a3>80 for one person and there was no alcohol included

outstanding restaurant with prices to match, we went for dinner besides an exceptional view on the bunt the restaurant offers fine dining par excellence the service was amazing wine selection awesome and the food outstanding although more expensive than other restaurants it was definitely worth it and you would pay more for a similar experience in paris london or new york a true experience that lasts longer than one evening, we got a business dinner last november it was my first time and the moment i arrived i already liked the setting modern decoration but cozy the meat is wonderfully done we had some appetizers like spanish ham prawns we also had a great dessert the wine was also great
i would certainly cone back, ive always fancied hotel indigo i feel that it gives you a feel of the city it sits in the property in shanghai along the bund is no exception and on top of the hotel is char bar and grill  where steak is fabulous and the view of the bund at night is amazing

a must visit not only for taking great photos of the bund and the river but also for the food and the complete cosmopolitan dining experience, yesterday my friends and i joined chars steak master class we had a great day learning all about meat and steaks directly from the head chef will colmenares who really made this class so enjoyable interesting and fun he really took the time to explain everything to the detail and answered all our questions we also had a chance to cook our own meats which was really cool and we also eat what we cooked which was super deliciousbest steaks ever  the class offers also an amazing lunch dessert and a certificate we really had a great saturday loved it then after this the chef recommended us to go to the bar which had one of the best views in shanghai we would like to say thanks to will and all hes team for an unique evening, i stayed at the indigo hotel again and this bar is a fantastic place to watch the city skyline from or not depending on the weather  haze, overly priced for a mid range meal  even with some fun stunts thrown in loads of great eating places in shanghai but this isnt one of them, great place for a special meal especially if you are wanting an excellent cut of beef expertly prepared service was good but the place is pricey expect to pay a lot for what you get, highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion the view is stunning the steaks are great and service very friendly expect the evening to be pretty expensive

the room is lovely and has a casual feel view from most tables is very special id recommend going to the balcony as it is breathtaking

steaks are very tender and nice  and even the steak knives themselves are very good service was friendly and the wine list was very good

all in all a pretty amazing restaurant, an exquisite elegant experience that i will remember for a long time

the elegance the quality the unpretentious top notch luxury the top quality of the dishes served the complete lack of compromise on the choice of the finest ingredients from the furthest reaches of the world the highly courteous and attentive staff the fine details of the table setting the stunning view of the sky grazing skyline of the city from high up in the clouds  all these together constitute one of the finest dinning experiences i have ever had anywhere in the world

a gastronomic experience an eye feast and a tantalising indulgence of luxury that is unparalleled

quality and excellence at its finest form, thought the food was good service was just okay and great views though you can get that from the bar nothing really to complain about but also did not seem that special to me so for the price would rather eat at some other places in shanghai mr  mrs bund m on the bund etc, we spent our last night of our business trip here

the restaurant is located in the hotel indigo and had a spectacular view over the water and the staff were extremely friendly

the food was delicious and the service was outstanding

can highly recommend, this is located in a very chic intercontinental group indigo hotel the food is really very good some of the better steaks in sh however we go there often to hang out at the bar and better yet the outdoor terrace is the observation space in town for a nice cocktail and watching the river traffic go by must visit, +++ very good food and very good experience
+++ very good standing
+++ meat looks amazing and very good portion
+++ pasta super tasty
+++ market fish was tuna in good portion and melting in your mouth
 the chilled soup was not to recommend
 everything is overpricey, this bar has the most fantastic view of the bund we were there from when the sun was up till after it had set so we got to see multiple views and it is just as spectacular in the evening as during the day the drinks were a little on the pricey side but i guess something has to pay for that view, this place is defiantly worth visiting the food is out of this world they even offer you a steak knife option the bread and complimentary wagu beef roll is wonderful my starter was the smoked octopus and fish bowl which was lovely the main corse was fabulous steak was perfectly cooked and the wine was perfectly matched

downsides

1 i really dont have a problem with children at restaurants but i i do have a problem when parents cant look after their children and they are playing with their parents phones on load and running around the restaurant as this restaurant was and is rated quite highly i wouldnt have thought you would get that here

2 im not sure if it was the bar upstairs or the kitchen as was sitting next to kitchen but i was getting a contrast of music which was off putting


bar those two things this restaurant has the potential to be one of the best restaurants i have ever been in i am being picky but when you are paying so much i expect it to run like swiss clock, on this visit to shanghai we had only a one evening stop over as we transited to other parts of china we went searching for a special dining experience and settled on char in the hotel indigo on the bund based on what we read on line our first indication that we had made a good choice came when we told the woman who picked us up at the airport where we were dining and a big smile came across her face when we arrived smiles came across our faces as well
the restaurant is very cool char is on the 29th floor of the hotel and is situated to give you an amazing view up the bund toward nanjing street and across the river to pudong the menu gave us good choices and the wine list was varied and offered good selections they pride themselves in sourcing their beef from australia we selected a rib eye that was made to be shared by 23 persons it was certainly enough food the steak was tasty tender and flavorful we began with a cold tomatowatermelon gasztpacho that was both a surprise and a delight the soup may have been my favorite item that evening it is a bit pricy but it is a steakhouse and is not more than you would expect to pay at capital grille or ruth chris in the states make sure to leave time to enjoy the bar on the 30th floor it is spacious and just a good time again the views are amazing the evening we were there a live jazz band was on the outside deck you can just sit back enjoy a cocktail and drink in the views of shanghais
the biggest compliment on char i leave for the endthe staff is just first rate we speak no chinese but the staff that assisted us were patient and helpful and attentive they took the time to insure that we ordered correctly we were over ordering and enjoyed our evening the people of char are what makes this place special i hope that they realize as does their management their contribution in making our visit to char a memorable one and our one night in shanghai special
xiexie, if you are in shanghai for a long while as a visitor or live there then char is a nice meal but if you only have a few meals in shanghai dont waste your time with char the bar and views are great so go up for a cocktail for sure worth the walk up the bund but the dining room is simply not worth the very pricey menu yes steaks are very good but not fabulous when compared to the best steakhouses in the us and the service is pretty poor considering it is an upscale restaurant the manager waited on us at first and was very attentive but then he disappeared and the staff very indifferent a bit disappointing considering it was a celebratory dinner, just worth going there for the view after a walk on the bund in shanghai cocktails are good and staff is attentive, char is absolutely the best steak house ive ever been and its not just in shanghai i cant say worldwide because i still have a long way to go but at least its the best ive been in asia and couple more countries ive visited everything is just superb starting with the location 29th floor of indigo hotel on the bund ps the hotel is amazing too
view the atmosphere the service the music the food literally everything u can choose the particular knife you want to cut your steak you can choose salt you can choose particular mustard and of course sauces i would also highly recommend the fish and salads desserts are yummy too everything is just perfection weve been to the steak masterclass where chef generously shared with us some of his secrets anyway if you are a meat lover if you are foodie or
if you need to impress your visitors defo bring them to char they will be treated so good they dont want to leave and also there is a char bar on the 30 or 31st floor i thinkcant remember good drinks and amazing view bon appetite and enjoy, time your arrival before sunset to get outdoor table along edge to witness sunset and night lights over the expanse of the bund  pudong

priceless views with beers starting at 60rmb cocktails around 100 up and delicious tapas from 80 up

dont know if regular but tonight was funksoul brilliant mix of music

ps some serious cameras and tripods used by bother parties to capture all glorious moments

must be one of the best viewing points in shanghai, like the hotel the view from char bar is amazing in the night dont feel like leaving this place the starters here are good must for atleast one evening loved it, food was excellent a little over price however you are also paying for the view and service

have your dinner then head up stairs to enjoy the wonderful views, fantastic atmosphere great meal and nice wine excellent service amazing and spectacular night view, went there on saturday with friends to celebrate my birthday
this was my second visitas the first time was disappointed many of my friends rave about this place and so i decided to give them another chance and the benefit of the doubt
we were seated quite quickly and the staff were relatively prompt to hand menus mentioning in detail the ryes of cuts and tenderness of the meats we decided and ordered the food and drinks
the first and biggest problemour waiter made a mistake passing order to the kitchen and i ended up with the wrong steak he did offer to correct ithowever i would have been sitting there staring at my friends eating
both my friends were satisfied with their steaksbut we all agreed based upon location prices and serviceit was not in the same league as ruths chris
they did deduct my steak off the final bill and also removed our drinkshowever it wasnt a good start to my birthday celebrations they dont realise its not the money issueits service
wont be going there again, this restaurant with its one of a kind open air terrace is the right place to impress your clients excellent food attentive yet discreet service with the eye for detailstry their selection of different types of salt to elevate your dish accompanied by an excellent wine list and if you are not sure what to choose bart will support you and make sure your evening will be a total success thank you for this experience, if you look for the perfect place to spend an unforgettable evening with excellent food attentive and skilled service and a breathtaking view over the bund area  this is the place to go it starts with the personal reception continues with a well balanced menue and you will be wowed by the details they pay attention to eg chose your favorite steak knife out of a very impressive selection not to mention their wine and dessert menue the icing on the cake however is bart and his team  they really go the extra mile to make it an extraordinary experience, fabulous views decor pleasant in a globalcould be anywhere in the world kind of way i recommend this place for a drink

service was extremely impersonal didnt see a single person smile food was okay no more when i sent my starter back almost untouched a very bland asparagus soup no one asked me why

prices are ludicrous  i had a meal at a two michelin star restaurant in the uk not the cheapest country in the world a few days earlier lenclume and this came out considerably more expensive to give you an idea one oyster will set you back about us$1150 for that kind of money i expect some serious cooking not a runofthemillcouldbeanywhere restaurant

screaming kids were running around and  climbing over running on the sofas staff didnt do anything about this i admit this is a very difficult thing to do, i had invited a business partner for dinner and had booked a table at the char steak restaurant specifically asking for a window table we also booked the outdoor terrace for drinks after dinner for 4 persons again specifically requesting that we would need to have the bund view from the terrace

when my guest and i arrived at the restaurant we realized that we were given a small table stuck in between two large tables  8 people on each and they were both people celebrating some corporate event and were extremely noisy on top they were very large people and while celebrating  were constantly moving around disturbing us

i spoke to the manager about our inconvenience and without any empathy he replied that we wanted a window table and that was a window table the arrogance and unprofessional was truly unbelievable sadly i had no choice as it was already late for me to relocate to another venue and i did not want to embarrass my important guest incidentally he was there for the first time and after the disastrous night swore never to visit stay or recommend anyone to this hotel

finally having gone through a very unpleasant dinner we waited for our other two guests to arrive and asked the staff to take us to the terrace

what awaited here was truly shocking

the terrace that we had booked  usually open for public was taken by the corporate customers for a private party and we were no allowed ot get in there instead we were taken to the otherside of the hotel not overlooking the bund but a terrible view

if this is a professional organization they would have done several things to avoid a very bad customer experience the hotel could have informed us that the terrace is booked and that we could not access to it rather than embarrassing us by letting us go there first and being refused access secondly the hotel should have made better arrangement of the least desirable side of the terrace for us to be enjoying the rest of the evening but properly making sure that the furniture is well provided staff being arranged to take care of us etc these are basic customer service points

instead the area where we were dumped had wet plastic lounge suites without any cushions or padding for us to sit we were seated on cold wet  dew unprepared lounge sofas there was one trainee in charge of several people who sadly had no clue about any drinks wines or even simple hotel basic s like sparkling water we ordered a 2000 plus chateau wine and she had no idea how to open the bottle or to get us the proper glasses

there was no management present no supervisors and this poor girl was totally left alone without any help

we  sadly left most of the wine behind and left this horrible and totally uncaring venue

this is no exaggeration but a brand which belongs to a great company  ihg  should not disappoint its customers like this, the cocktails in the bar were not amazing as the view they played a very strong club music at 7pm but it worth the money for exploring shanghai with friends who just came from my home town
we did not order the steaks in the restaurant 1 beef burger and some seafood dishes everything was perfect the service staffs are helpful and friendly the apple pie with flame was very impressed, i have taken friends an colleagues to char on a number of occasions the roof top bar has a bund view that cannot be topped inventive drinks and a top notch wine list the restaurant is the best steak house in shanghai, on my second visit i verified again char is one of the best restaurant for entertaining i had a group of inverstors from euro the staffs here made them feel home really good service with fun and attention to detail
we ordered a big beef plate to share nothing was desapointing offered to choose a steak knife which is a bonus
theres 10 service charge now new added on top of the bill but we paid for a great meal, delicious food wonderful service and beautiful view it is a pricey special occasion place but love the way they pace the meal so you can relax and enjoy the experience the chocolate lava cake dessert was very nice steaks and sides delicious neat that you pick out a special steak knife for your meal bravo char, fantastic service and amazing meal at the char grill we had the tomahawk steak 12 kg to share between two of us it was a large portion each and cooked to perfection side dishes were also amazing desert was limited for my taste buds and i went for the ice cream, a year later i came back for dinner with my business partners they have a new western chef in the kitchen food was great but my favorite rib eye steak was still the best in shanghai the red prawn was good but too pricey service was outstanding compare to other steakhouses in town
the music was not a love overall char is a nice restaurant if your pocket is prepared, have to say somewhat disappointing my 3rd visit but will be low down on options for the future food is typically very good as are the views but service was average at best and many of the menu selections not available considering what youre paying  really some distance off great value, delicious food great service and the best view on pudong area youll ever find in shanghai obviously not cheap but you pay for what you get, only had a few drinks and enjoyed the most wonderful views of the ships skyscrapers and night lights of shanghai i consider this the best view from char bar and there are two areas so dont forget to see both before you leave of course everything is expensive but the views are truly excellent","French cuisine",0.999802767983525
210,"if you get tired from a chinese foodrestaurants this palace can provide good western food burgers pasta  price quality is correct service is very good professional and polite, just had lunch here after walking around daning tulip park nice selection of western food and enjoyed my chicken herbed burger also good to sit outside and just watch the world pass by especially now outdoor dinner in shanghai is smoke free whilst the restaurant was quite busy the staff were still attentive good food and good value for money, blue frog in daning offers good western food and is well frequented service is good and the place is always crowded, great pizza over a nice chilled craft beer great alfresco set up outside pasta is another option choose the seafood selections, i visited several times whilst at the four points very friendly staff who serve good food and good beer, first beer arrived quickly  second beer took forever  staff never looked around to see if customers needed anything  we finally got to order food and the appetizer was the last to be delivered food was good  but service has a lot to be desired, ive been here a few times as work colleagues like the burger deals the food is ok but nothing special if you get a burger while there are quite a few options its fairly run of the mill flavour wise service was ok by shanghai standards it helps break up the constant chinese food day in and day out not a bad place but not the burger equivalent of what new york style pizza is for pizza in shanghai, the blue frog is across the street from the four points sheraton and thus convenient for travelers they have very good food and a nice range of menu items and drinks, this is my favorite place for every special they offer  i always go monday to get there burger  best burger ever  wednesday i get the ribeye steak for 188  australian beef  good money value  this is the place for great deals , the burgers here are amazing the monday burger special deal is definitely the only time you should go however as normal prices are staggeringly expensive the drinks are pretty good and service is excellent, well this is a buzzing night place for good food but drinks are less inviting fast service and great wait staff located across from sheraton four points so lots of waiguoren prices are what you would expect from a trendy restaurant though 300 rmb for 2 with dessert which was very good i might say i had a burger which was flavorful but the mull wine was really bad and hot chocolate was so weak its still chilly these days, the food good probably the best american you could taste nice ambient great long island tea

the bad the place is small and often crowded ive been here during the week and weekends and always ended up waiting up to 30 min for a seat better book it, and its not only this place my first time in a blue frog restaurant yes it has a nice atmosphere and the service is good but after i ate the hamburger ive been longing for a long time i wasnt very impressed ive eaten cheaper and tastier hamburgers elsewhere

i noticed that there are many customers and theyre orders differ in salads pastas soups and so on some even go there just to have a drink or a cup of coffee

even if its a western specific restaurant it still has a chinese taste the food is good and they have buy one get one free for hamburgers on monday also a happy hour for drinks but dont expect it to be a jawdropping experience, tried the mixed grill  the serving is of good size price is reasonable tasty food stayed opened till midnite, this place used to be shanghai first and true american food place
lately some ownership changes occurred and you can easily feel it with the food quality quantity and service
i know this chain for more than a decade and was a loyal customer our last experience proved again that ownership does matter dishes are much smaller prices are high and you can easily see that they only care about making money here
wont be back, we had a lovely asian meal with drinks which was quite reasonably priced the restaurant was situated in a shopping mall in the centre of shanghai near the peoples square but not sure of the street some of the staff spoke basic english which was unusual for shanghai and it was clean and nicely served, the place was near to my office so i walked in to the place after office hour and i found the place was full of crowd so i guessed this place should be good i ordered a chicken salad and soup the quality of the food was good somehow the bill was quite expensive the place has good atmosphere thanks to the music and crowds, had good food out here had limited options of vegetarian food ordered a pasta and a burger which were good had a complimentary drink as well with it, what pleasure for lunch or dinner good eats well prepared and well presented
excellent service and reasonable prices all in all much fun and great value, finally able to get a good coffee in china the brunch was western style and well presented good and attentive service, food and service was great there had yummy burgers and chips even though a bit pricey with the randyuan exchange but well worth it to eat some western food  mondays burger special is buy one get one free which was most exciting, the atmosphere in the restaurant is great great food and drinks very famous hangout place in daning must try their thai green curry, monday take 2 buy 1 burger deal is very popular as well as happy hour drinks during the week good and practical location near the cinema and inside the shopping area popular especially during the evenings sometimes the service might take some time good quality for money always when visiting blue frog especially during afternoon and early evening, i had really high hopes before visiting this restaurant but unfortunately i was truly disappointed i ordered the original blue frog burger and was served the poorest burger ive ever seen there was no love or passion put into this dish the fries tasted like the ones you get at an amusement park the meat on the other hand was pretty ok but the bread looked so old and dull the dish was served together with a salad that tasted like paper and for the price 78 rmb it was a real waste of money since i had dumplings for lunch that cost me 6 rmb that were 10 times better than this
the only highlight to this restaurant was my company and that before 8pm you get two drinks for the price of one, american style restaurant choice of the usual global food stuff including burgers pasta salads mexican dishes etc quite generic menu nice atmosphere and acceptable noise level prices are acceptable other than that nothing special, enjoyed the western styled food it was tasty and reasonably priced service was great but found the music was far to loud for normal conversation, little bit of a western haunt however good food and a good environment check out the websites as they have specials such as 2 for 1 on burgers on mondays and steaksoupglass of wine for rmb188

enjoy, if you want to bite into a decent hamburger with oz meat this is the place to go several location in shanghai the drinks are good lucky have been there during the happy hour and the hamburger was tasty the frites nothing special but all in a decent non asian meal in shanghai prices are in the mid range but still not expensive, this pubbar was okay i mean they have better pubbar around the bund this one is okay if you are too lazy to got to the bund the hamburger was standard a bit dry though ambiance decor etc are pretty basic =, blue frog is a good choice for western food and a couple of drinks  they have outside seating unfortunately smoking permitted  the burgers are good, we hade dinner multiple times at the blue frog consistent quality and enough to choose from including pasta salads and even mexican food can not go wrong here
sitting outside is great as there are only few cars passing by and theres enough to see on the terrace, very basic food kind expensive for what they serve  had a chicken fajita and the tortillas wasnt toasted well  if you only have this place as a choice go for  drinks are the same price as a nicer restaurant 50rmb for a glass of wine  better get there for happy hour before 7pm, i love the burgers here salads are also good service is slow at the middle of the day albeit friendly the menu is mainly western and the dishes can be adopted to suit vegetarians as long as they eat milk and egg one of the few that serves vegetarian in this part of town fair selection of drinks including different teas

open late so dont despair if your arrival is delayed, hungry at 10pm one of the few places that remain open at this time in downtown shanghai i particularly like the blue cheese sauce that was served with one of the sides we ordered i cant remember and burgers are awesome, waiter is a little slow people keep smoking cigarettes

though the smoothie is ok i like the sweet milkshake but it seems too sweet, we heard about the place from a friend and wanted to try chinese food is absolutely not an option and blue frog was a nice alternative
we went on saturday without prebooking and the place was crowded only 23 free tables they serve the food fast and the service is also on the level
especially i liked desserts and free drinks refill
place is very close to subway station line 1 just follow gps directions, staff spoke good english and were very helpful food all came out on time which is a rarity in china and was hot and tasty no complaints for good service and a great time, good environment with free wifi good beer  food available and nice people inside very popular at chinese youth and foreign business people excellent mixture try it out, my pals and i like to go to various blue frogs around shanghai every monday night for the 2for1 burger specials however tonight we had a couple incidents that left a bad taste in our mouth

firstly knowing how packed blue frog gets by 6pm on mondays i tried to call ahead the day before to make a reservation i was told by the receptionist that none of the blue frogs accept reservations on mondays so we arrived at 545 and saw several tables available phew we thought but no  the greeter told us all these tables were reserved what but you said on the phone that no reservations are allowed on mondays yes the man replied because the reservations were already booked no thats not what you told me on the phone thats because all the reservations were full he repeated in classic chinesetalkingincircles finally my friend an expat magazine editor who personally knows bob boyce the owner threatened to put in a call if they didnt find us a table they promptly did and we enjoyed our meal by 630 we saw why all the tables had been reserved  large groups of young chinese professionals who work nearby were obviously the preferred clientele of this blue frog establishment clearly only reservations for foreigners were not allowed maybe a call to bob boyce is in order after all

our second incident arrived with our food  my other friend is allergic to onions and dislikes sauteed vegetables he specifically ordered a veg burger with no onions and no vegetables the waitress made a note in her book the food arrived soon veg burger no onions or vegetables she announced and handed it to my friend he opened up the bun and sure enough theres onions and vegetables galore not a big deal  he just scooped them out and gave them to me  but it demonstrated that while the waitress was aware of the request she had failed to pass it on to the chef

stuff like this happening back west results in free orders and the occasional law suit if the person becomes sick from allergies even though this is china westernowned restaurants still need to train their local staff and management better or theyll run your businesss reputation right to the ground

but we still do love our monday burgers and fries at blue frog so we hope management shapes up so we dont have another night like this, we have lived in china for 7months now and love coming here the staff are super friendly will make sure your meal is fine which is not common practice here

blue frog is our treat  food from home, by far blue frog one of the best restaurants in shanghai food is really good service is great and waiterswaitresses are supersuper friendly
mexican burger is my fav on monday  where they have buy one and get one free burger offer in general i love their salads appetizers and deserts everything about this restaurant i was a bit surprized while reading the reviews i thought most people would praise this delicious place, blue frog is a chain in shanghai and is the place to go for a good mix of burgers+music+beer i went there a few times for lunch and dinner and the food quality is consistent the choice of beers isnt great a little disapointing the food tastes good the music and atmosphere is good and friendly waiters are friendly but a little pushy for lunch as they are trying to have you order side dishes in addition to the set meal it is just opposite the 4 points sheraton hotel so very convenient and its the best western restaurant in the area there are plenty of better western restaurant in shanghai downtown but in daning this is the only one, the food is great and the service very good at friday nights you may need to wait some time for table though, i had lunch at the blue frog today it is just across the street from the 4 points sheraton hotel and easy to find it is busy at lunch time but the service is still good the fresh garden salad is as fresh as advertised and very good i ordered a side of french fries i was surprised by the size of the order and was not able to eat them all the chicken sliders are also very good and more than most would want in one meal not only is the food american style but so are the portions and while the portions are generous the prices remain very reasonable, you cant go wrong having a meal and a drink at the vibrant blue frog we have been eating here for several years now when we visit shanghai and it is always consistent we no longer stay in the daning precinct but we will make the trip there for one of our dinners the food is good great service but it only seems to be getting busier i like it more now that the entire inside of the restaurant is nonsmoking they always have great specials throughout the week and when we visited on a monday night their special for the night was buy a hamburger and get one free bargain happy hour is pretty good too, blue frog is just in front of four point hotel in daning zone more that a restaurant it look like a diner or pub but the dishes choice is decent and the grilled meats taste is good customers are both young tourists and young local poeple music is high but youre still able to talk each other without screaming, simple but good quality food very friendly staff and a nice ambience make this a favourite restaurant when i am in the area western style food the burgers are especially good, waiters have a very good english
food has a lot of calories 
this is a restaurant out of a little local chain usually frequented by young chinese professionals or by westerns
good ambiente , it has a very good location very easy to find they definitely have great food i love their sandwiches fresh bread and ingredients i am guessing i love the atmosphere of the place mildly cozy yet you still feel the ambience of cafeish style their service is great and the staffs are always happy to serve for what i see because they smile a lot recommending this to everyone especially to those who love to just sit down and relax and enjoy their food while surfing on net or just reading a book , this blue frog location is a quick 35 minute walk from line 1 yan chang rd station exit yan chang rd station at exit 4 walk north to the next intersection and you will find a suburban mall the blue frog is located right across from the four points sheraton so it is an easy location to find

i had the blue frog iced tea which is their version of a long island iced tea and was pleasantly buzzed by the end of my meal i had the salmon sliders which tasted generally fresh and i thought it was an interesting food idea the salmon was a little overcooked but its probably not that easy to cook perfectly in a fast turn restaurant

there is a nice outside section partially covered so smokers will feel invited to have a place to enjoy their dinner

i did end up waiting for my bill for about 10 minutes then just asked someone who wasnt my server and go the bill and receipt right away i guess they are busy so the server was probably just trying to do her best but got distracted during the dinner rush

i dont love it and i dont hate it but if youre staying in the nearby area its a good place to eat if youre looking for some good western alternative","vegetarian restaurant",0.737119950584178
211,"papaya salad and spring rolls were fantastic a good atmosphere a great location with a overall feeling of a small xin tian di, the food is really good vietnamese healthy simple and no expensive service very friendly and overall the experience is great worth to try, recommended by a friend of mine whos very knowledgeable about the local food scene went here for pho and it was great  terrific broth with lots of flavor fresh spice condiments aplenty noodles had good consistency plenty of other options like banh mi and bun cha nice surroundings well lit space on a busy corner in old jingan, a friend recommended cyclo for lunch the restaurant is located in northen jingan it is not an accessible restaurant as there are many stairs to go up to the entrance and to enter the main dining area there are more stairs the food on the other hand is pretty good we ordered the traditional pho and the vietnamese spring rolls and both were really tasty, felt like some fresh vietnamese food for lunch so found this place on trip advisor and thought wed give it a go we were not disappointed we ordered a few dishes including some pho papaya salad and the tasting plate all were delicious and we will definitely be back on our next trip well worth a look up if you like your vietnamese food, delicious food and cosy atmosphere this is one of our favorite restaurants in shanghai
fresh and tasty vietnamese food the drink basil drops are drops from heaven green papaya salad pepperspicy cod fresh spring rolls and the beef noodles are some of our familys favorites
a place we love to return to both for the food the atmosphere and the kind staff, surprisingly there are very limited numbers of quality vietnamese restaurants in shanghai my thought is that there would be a larger market for this fare in our international culinary circus that is shanghai my taste buds have finally found a new home in their quest for vietnamese

everything about cyclo hits the mark the food is fantastic the presentation is detailed and effective the service is exceptional the atmosphere is just right prices are incredibly reasonable

we had the pork and shrimp fried spring rolls the beef pho and the the papaya salad they all exceeded expectations from previous experiences with vietnamese in shanghai and all of the dishes brought out to the other tables looked delicious i look forward to going back and trying more selections off of the menu drink menu is comprehensive

if you are craving vietnamese eat here you will not be disappointed, ive been to cyclo a couple of times now for dinner with friends and have been impressed every time as my title says i just love the atmosphere of this its just so warm and romantic it would be perfect for a date although i am not vietnamese and dont have very much experience with vietnamese cuisine ive heard that this is the most authentic place in town and it certainly tastes like it highlights were probably the green papaya salad and the red wine beef pho dont miss the basil cocktail i get it every time i go it is so delicious the price is to be expected in this part of town and for this quality of food but it does make this place more of a special occasion type dinner definitely recommend it if you are in this part of town and craving some really nice vietnamese food, as cyclo has become one of my top 3 restaurant it is a ritual for me and my friends to drop by every week or so this time we tried the cua rang moi  salt  pepper crab excellent  i took the time to finally write a comment about cyclo because it is definitely a place to recommend as i find it the best vietnamese restaurant in shanghai and am always impress and satisfied by the food 
my favorite dishes 
 steamed spring rolls
 mango salad
 lemon grass clams
 vietnamese pancake
 and now the crab 

enjoy , when i travel i always hope to find a place that makes a good bowl of pho i was beginning to despair such a place did not exist in china that was until cyclo was discovered from a review in shanghai list by benjamin cost

what can i say mr cost has nailed it the broth was a flavourful and has that wonderful smells o a beef broth that has been cooked slow and long brings back memory of my childhood of the local pho place at the corner of my home in vietnam the bowl had just the right balance of noodles and beef the only thing lacking was sawtooth coriander i know that is a big ask other dishes that we tried were

prawn paste on sugarcane and vermicelli with salad and a very balance nuoc mam blended fish sauce there were two serve of prawns which was very well done not too much flour as some other place might try to do

papaya salad with prawn a nice refreshing dish again the nuoc chamnuoc mam done very well nice balance of sweetness and acidity and a nice good kick from the chilli

overall a very nice authentic taste good ambience and great service you will find a few expats dinning here and the staff also spoke excellent english if you are tired of pointing or guessing what you are eating
i would definitely recommend cyclo for authentic vietnamese flavours and hospitality in shanghai, as a vietnamese i was looking for authentic vietnamese food in shanghai but it is not easy to find however i was very impressed by cyclos restaurant the design i very nice atmosphere is friendly the waiters are efficient and the owner always smiles

the food is excellent my favorite is banh xeo bun thit nguong and basilic cocktail  cyclo is good place for vietnamese food , my mother and i have been trying to find a good vietnamese restaurant for awhile as we miss our home food but nothing was up to our expectation till cyclo as a vietnamese eating at cyclo felt like home i was amazed how delicious the food were and reasonable price the make the traditional vietnamese coffee imported from vietnam
very friendly owner and stuff since that i go to cyclo at least once a week
if you are looking the real vietnamese food cyclo is the place, if you are vietnamese this restaurant is so so the price is so high saigon beer in vietnam is 3rmb in this restaurant sale 40rmb, a vietnamese restaurant gem in shanghai cyclo offers you a cozy and simple experience that wont leave you unsatisfied the papaya salad was fresh and crispy with just the right amount of kick and the cha ca la vong is a flavor punch of turmeric and fresh herbs a bonus the service is attentive but not overbearing friendly and fast definitely worth a visit, my wife and i were torn on where to have lunch the other day she wanted japanese which i was not up for after seeing the reviews for cyclo and the food photos on their website we found an agreeable meal the restaurant is clean and has pleasant modern decoration seats are not packed in like most shanghai restaurants we started with papaya salad and fried pork and shrimp spring rolls the papaya salad was excellent reminiscent of papaya salad made fresh in the streets of laos the spring rolls were also excellent an explosion of flavors starty with that unmistakable musty taste of dried shrimp i ordered the grilled chicken bahn mi this was the best bahn mi i have ever had fresh bread with tasty grilled chicken and fresh veggies my wife ordered the chicken and shrimp pho she had the wude noodles by far the best pho i or her have ever had the bowl was filled with chicken fish shrimp leeks and other vegetables the soup served on the side all either of us could say is we will never return to the pho places back home they are not even close to this quality i do not even remember having these dishes this good in ho chi minh i also ordered a mojito excellent again very genorous on mint in a large glass later on yongkang lu i could not help but miss this excellent drink all ingredients are very fresh which is what really helps to characterize great southeast asia food this is a must return to spot, this restaurant is absolutely fabulous it is goodlooking with attention to design pretty furniture and cutlery the welcome is warm and the food is excellent fiery when you need it soothing when you dont lots of fresh herbs and excellent service wow loved it, it was really a nice surprice yesterday to find this cozy and romantic vietnameese restaurant in shanghai surely the best of its gender top quality service and food obviously lead by foreigner management probably really from vietnam only pity is the limited main course food choice i would say since this place looks mostly oriented for lunch set definitely worth a visit also thank to great downtown and decent price compared to shanghai average budget do not miss the grilled snake head fish and go there by taxi or bike cause parking lots is not available, i like spring rolls bun thit nuong canh chua ca kho to it is the best choice if you want to try vietnamese food in shanghai, cyclo does an excellent job with delicious vietnamese fares served in a cozy setting they are the best option for authentic vietnamese food in shanghai i tried several dishes and each one of them transported me back to the refined and amazing flavors of vietnam, nice cosy restaurant with good food and authentic cuisine staff are pleasant helpful and very efficient service is prompt, ate here last night and the food was delicious we ordered vegetarian spring rolls beef pho papaya salad and beef fried rice and i recommend all of those plates service was also great, i had the opportunity to eat my favorite vietnamese food pho
i am from brazil and there is a server from spain owner from france since i do not speak mandarin i could communicate easily in english spanish and french
price is not bad restaurant is clean
i recommend to all who is looking good food good service and good price, we had a great experience at cyclo menu is authentic vietnamese the chicken pho was excellent staff are very friendly but the service was a little slow at times this was not really a problem but is an area where they could improve

all the dishes we had were really tasty and well presented we especially enjoyed the basil drop cocktail which we would highly recommend and the saigon beer

good choice for a good meal, good clean vietnamese restaurant in nice location salt and pepper shrimps the best thing we tried all the usual fare decent prices, if you are looking for something new in shanghai but still want to eat asian food cyclo offers you an alternative to all the chinese restaurants 

all the dishes remind you very easily of a trip you had or will have in vietnam 

large choice of vietnamese dishes and they even have beers from there 

the decoration is simple but very well done 

service is good orders are taken quickly and the food get served in proper time 

in conclusion  a nice place to go to in order to break the routine of all the restaurants you have in shanghai and that offer mostly the same menus ","Turkish cuisine",0.543663459202403
212,"i really enjoy this version of mortons it is more relaxed and informal than the normal mortons steakhouse beef was well cooked and very tasty met the manager he was a very funny guy mexican i think he treated us well and gave us a feeling like it wasnt our first time there we will go back, one of the best steak house in town fresh and fatty oysters amazing steak fine wine the service is great, went for a late dinner at around 815pm the place was not crowded for a sunday night food was excellent always love their bread the cold seafood platter had enough food for me the steak was perfect but we couldnt finish the mac and cheese dish and wished they could let us order in half servings

the only thing needs to be improved was the servers attention to he customers it was slow to get our order taken and then to get another drink order in also while our server was taking the order he suddenly turned to another tables server and talked to him in the middle of conversation with us overall great food but not quite up to the mortons standard in service, i thought this place was amazing so much that during our week stay we came twice the atmosphere is great the service is excellent the have two private rooms with a view they were empty the first night so we had a really nice view of the city i highly recommend it i will add it is on the pricey side but i think it is absolutely worth it the bread and butter were great overall great experience, great steak one ofthe best oysters in town as well ambiance not the typical mortons but more casual managers makes u try nice drinks that makes u want to cone back, i enjoyed the quality and attention paid to prepare the food this is more than just a steak house because i loved their sea food platters like crab meat lobsters and shrimps we usually order steaks and sea food dishes to share among our guests we also ask their staffs to recommend wines to match our dishes they usually do a good job suggesting excellent but not necessary real expensive wines, although this mortons could have been pricy we were lucky to go there for lunch they were doing special lunch pricing along with an oyster promotion we got 6 beautiful and delicious oysters for christmas for $27 i has the prime burger with all the trimmings and carmen had the halibut filets we both had the lobster bisque soup this was a great mortons meal for a reasonable price we will definitely return read your menus and ask what is on special

great place, normally you dont travel to china to have have steak well maybe we should change that  mortons shanghai is absolutely amazing in the quality and service they offer the views of the oriental pearl tower are also an added bonus ive had dinner there too many times and have not been disappointed once including on my last visit i would suggest to make a reservation for the washington room and enjoy the great good and amazing sights, the steak are good  the services also very good  environment are bright and confortable  but really the price are creasy 
coffee  maybe done with evian water , besides good beef very good raw bar including a very diverse oyster selection i have been there several times i was solo and like the ease of eating at the bar when alone manager stepped in when bar tenders english was halting service was good and manger offered a complimentary after dinner drink in a great mall so shopping before after dinner is an option, great meat fantastic oysters and outstanding service better by far than mortons at ifc mall i will surely return soon, our dinner was a nice treat in shanghai  when one of our steaks came out a little too rare  they graciously cooked it to our satisfaction fyi  their sides are large enough to be shared
now  the nicest surprise of the evening came when we told the manager what difficulties we were having getting taxis to get anywhere in shanghai he arranged a service to bring us back to our hotel and then the driver told us we didnt owe him anything  it was a lovely ride and a very kind gesture by a very professional manager, i had lunch appointment with buz partner at morton iapm store everything is good include the wine mussels tata and steak but the new launch dessert  strawberry and lycee pie upset us too sweet and heavy i want my apple pie back, decoration and atmosphere is different than the normal mortons like dinning in california rather than in chicago like it anyway, the service is excallent and serve protion was big i have order the signature cut and standard was maintained of course shanghai charge was the more expensive compare to other area mortons but is worth to go if you want to have a good steak meal, we brought our pastor from kansas to mortons shanghai for our last get together lunch before we bid him farewell the shrimp diablo and crab cake were excellent the tbone and filet were done to perfection not to mention the mash potato with sour cream and bacon we finished off the lunch with raspberry sorbet molten lava cake and apple crisp pastor finished the apple crisp and said it was the best hes ever tasted we would definitely bring him back to mortons for his next visit to shanghai, friendly and nice staff and the food is excellent and delicious not cheap but worth the money specially the spinach salad and the cheese cake are extraordinary delicious, a visit to mortons usually takes patrons to a seasoned clubby style dining environment with sober decor occasional wood panelling and subdued lighting not so in shanghai  the look and feel is very bright and modern so much so that it doesnt feel quite the same the food was good and the service was attentive but i still prefer the traditional look and feel such as you find at mortons at the sheraton in hong kong this is fine dining with an emphasis on the steaks but overall it did not quite live up to expectations maybe it has stronger appeal to the local shanghainese but for expats used to the traditional feel it will take awhile to get fully acclimatized, its been a million times that mortons always keep a very high standard on their way to serve excellent cooking of steak and services
we tried some of their new dishes and thanks diego for his hospitality to make the evening so special
ribeye steak is highly recommended, there is no doubt shanghai is growing and with it the offer of places to go and spend good time but on this large offer of restaurants very few can maintain a stable and solid quality of service food and atmosphere mortons is doing
the quality of the service is sincerely outstanding and makes a substantial different in comparison from the competition if any
i can highly recommend this restaurant with the same mark of its american source an oasis in shanghai, we always compare those chain restaurants with the ones that we are familiar with this one is quite unique because it is the combo of mortons and oyster bar from grand central in new york city the gm there diego is an incredible young man with wealth of knowledge in wine cigar and almost everything else quite a place to hang out after work or weekend with family, we started with the happy hour 57 pm and stayed for a quick bite on the patio that is right smack in front of the iconic pearl tower
happy hour with the selection of very strong margaritas not watered down like in many other places is an excellent deal for rmb 45each just for that is worth the visit then they throw for free the little sliders mini buns with steak and this suddenly becomes the best deal in town for the happy hour you can eat as many as you can grab when they go around with them and dont need to buy anything extra to make your memorable evening
we however a reservation they were nice enough to accommodate our request for outside seating while some people smoked there tables are spaced apart far enough that the smoke does not bother anyone since after the sliders we were already partially full we grabbed baked seafood plate to share 34 people for rmb 1150 and lobster bisque the food was just exceptional  what else would you expect for that kind of dough however it was well worth it
menu has many excellent choices with rmb600 signature steals sides to share rmb 90100each and seafood choices for half that money you may think that this is a pile of dough but seen steaks in local high class restaurants for rmb 1200 yeah with dab of potato and some veggies so mortons is not that overly pricey
service is excellent but not too bothering so all together it was a very nice experience if you dine inside in a rainy weather they have a large room with many tables right next to windows that overlook pearl tower from slightly different angle request these when you are booking far ahead and you are not sure what the weather will be like, pessimo cibo e prezzi spropositati per la qualita e quantita da evitare assolutamente
first and last time in this so called high quality restaurant 3 scampi 1 halibut chinese mushrooms 200 euro 
i never complain about prices in fact i have been reading menu and their prices so i was free to accept or not butbut quality  i always pay for good quality food but now i am really disappointed and surprised by low quality of food
i can accept that in some street cheap food but not in a restaurant like this wannabeneither a towel to clean fingers after eating seafood, not just any mall a high end one with brand like prada tiffany panarei etc to keep mortons in good company good food the salmon was great and my friend had a porterhiuse steak which he finished good wine selection too, manager benson has really looked after his guest recommended the seafood and steak and pouring the wine by himself food was delicious nothing to complain although the prices is a little over the top we will come back, very warm service and a predictable menu for someone craving oysters and or steakjust not worth the very high pricenot on a par wit us based mortons , good
service is great there is even an indian waiter there who speaks putonghua location is also great being in the mall environment is not bad at all and feels cosy

not so good
food quality is not fantastic being someone who has tried mortons in chicago and hong kong the food is not prepared in a professional manner that correlates with the price tag i ordered a steak to be prepared to mediumwell done the piece of steak came with reddish bleeding presentation not very professional indeed

this outlet is good if you want to impress a business partner or your date for food quality that equates to the price tag not recommended, i was already familiar with the mortons brand name from positive experiences in the us i had also been to the branch in shanghai pudong on several occasions and held it in high regard as such i was biased when i came to the new establishment in the iapm mall on huahai middle road in puxi

i have now been there more than 6 times and love it
it has become my go to place for happy hour as well as important company and personal events
i have never seen a restaurant assistant manager who works as hard to know his customers as mr satish kumar birhade i receive a thank you email after ever visit asking me to critique the happy hours 57pm and 911pm are infamous

most importantly the beef and the seafood are outrageously fresh and the portions are huge
the service is absolutely to western standards

dont expect to come in here for an inexpensive meal
you get what you pay for  it costs a lot but the quality and portions make it a fair value

as arnie saysill be back, ordered a dessert which i heard was really good and wanted to try

i ordered the chocolate lava cake

i was told i would have to wait at least 30 mins for which i didnt mind waiting for

however when it arrived i was expecting a lot more being mortons and knowing their high prices i was expecting top quality and delicious flavour

it was really soft at the top and almost tasted burnt on the bottom

for the size i dont know why it was so expensive and to top it off with service charge 150 rmb for a dessert is out of this world even with their happy hour normal prices anywhere else i know next time to go somewhere else and i wont have a service charge, at first i was disappointed at how bright white and blue the restaurant is because the steakhouse vibe that i know and love is missing however the food more than makes up for it ive been a couple of times now and been happy with everything my favorites are the fried red chili squid the seafood martini the steak obviously and the lobster pasta a couple of surprises came when i had a bite of my dates mac n cheese whoa so creamy and a tiny bit spicy the other surprise was the peanut butter pie i cant help but think it takes like a very classic american dish the ice cream sandwiches were so  so but the key lime pie was as good as ever also same awesome happy hour 57pm with free steak sandwiches and olives means ill be back again and again, new mortons opened in puxi and is not only steak this time
many selections of seafood and many diferent kinds of oysters

213,"ive been here a few times both for dinners most recently a week ago celebrating an event we were there for a custom set dinner the food was great each with a minimalist asian infusion service was adequate and courteous and the chef came out to greet us as well dont forget to check out the terrace on the 6th floor definitely postcard worthy, i contacted shook and they accommodated a birthday celebration for 30 they were extremely helpful and communicative and helped with all of my numerous requests i chose shook because ive been before and every time i have been was a great experience if you go to shook i suggest going up to their terrace with some predinner drinks followed by a seat closest to the window in the main dining room chef brian is an amazing chef and super nice  dont hesitate to say hello highly recommended for bund views + couples dinner  family dinner  friends dinner not sure about business dinner but they do have some semiprivate dining rooms in the back overallm highly recommended d, over 7 years of living in shanghai and its hard to find a restaurant that matches the quality of food service and environment we were there for a big gathering for a friends bday and had an amazing meal + drinks they made a separate menu for vegan and pregnant friends the rooftop terrace is enough reason to go here, we had a lovely meal in this very beautiful restaurantwhile the service was excellent the food while very good wasnt as good you would expect from the price point absolutely nothing to complain about just not as memorable as it could have been, i have lunched at shook many times over the past 5 years and the food is always consistently delicious this last time it was just plain tops it was an organized lunch on the amazing terrace with the best bund view each dish was excellent and service was impeccable i highly recommend it and i will certainly be coming back , seven years of living in shanghai i have never had such a wonderful lunch nor given a 5 star the service was impeccable the food was delicious the atmosphere amazing twenty three ladies and we each left feeling pampered and well fed well done shook kudos to nick for organizing and brian the chef, we loved our delicious meal at shook their wine list is extensive and the dishes we ate were excellent examples of fusion food interesting flavoursingredients from all over asia were subtly added to enhance the high quality meat  fish dishes the portions were generous and the desserts were edible works of art the service was excellent too
the view of the bund is superb  remember that most of the lights are switched off at 10pm so go early a reservation for this restaurant is necessary especially if you would like to be seated next to a window theres a great rooftop bar that opens during the warmer months offering views across the bund, a beautiful restaurant and a great location  the evening we were here the restaurant was totally empty and consequently lacking in atmosphere the service was good  and so was the food the menu was i must admit quite limited but great if you like fish and sea food  i do  great place but we were a little disappointed because there was just no atmosphere, i have been for the first time there for lunch i have to say that the service is very below my expectation im not high demanding guest but im expecting at least the minimum such as 1 asking for a drink 2 somebody in the restaurant 3 menu knowledge i dont know we can have such bad service in such great environment positive point the food was ok nothing outstanding as well wont come back, the meal was beautifully prepared and the food quality was exceptional the location was also good with views of the harbor and lights highly recommend, ridiculous expensive but i guess that is expected for the bund the food looked beautiful but lacked taste the flavors seemed unbalanced for example raw fennel field flowers and tart citrus fruit atop grilled fish and a bunch of other stuff it looks pretty but was not that great to eat anyway if you go for drinks and small bites on the terrace it can be a great fun overlooking the bund, this place has the whole package its right on the bund you have a perfect view of the river the pearl is across the way the interior is modern and impeccably appointed service is en pointe and in case you cant speak chinese the servers have a good command of english

we were fortuitously here for brunch week i had a smoked salmon appetizer that was light but had great smoky flavor the bread was accompanied with two types of herbed butter and my main course was a nicely constructed duck confit hash everything was artfully plated and presented

had a lovely meal strongly recommend shook, well firstly i have to say how impressed i was with the table we enjoyed a great view despite the rather dismal weather this was probably due to how quiet the restaurant was in fact there seemed to be only a couple of small parties in the restaurant on a busier day i would say get in quick so that you can guarantee one of the two tables which are in view of the financial district the waiter would be best described as a little hostile but the food was delicious and the mojitos went down far too easily ill be back, enjoyed a great dining experience at shook on my first night in shanghai in dec the rooftop has an awesome view of the river and pudong while within the restaurant the views are limited the decor and set up is excellent service was very professional while the food and presentation was one above expectations however in any of these restaurants price may be a notch too high, in the most elegant area of shanghaithe bundthis restaurant has the right atmosphere taste and quality for an unforgettable romantic dinner or for a quite business dinnerthe choice of menu is wide and never boringthe service is simply perfectstrongly recommended by a shanghai italian expat, i have been to shook on a number of occasions for drinks receptions on the terrace the food was excellent and i mean excellent staff are really attentive but a tad slow as the event organiser i have needed to keep an eye on things to ensure things run smoothly definately worth a trip for the view alone, we used to come to shook with our friends or family with something to celebrate the restaurant is a bit expensive but has always been perfect last night we came for a drink with friends the receptionist and the waiter were harsh the bar was not clean at least not at the level you would expect for this kind of restaurant
i was really sorry, went here during the restaurant week festival in shanghai food was excellent great value menu during this festival enjoyed the open rooftop bar also not too busy as rooftop bars go, booked this restaurant as ending of sh restaurant week

reserved window table in advance and get a nice table the decoration is modern and elegant liked the open kitchen as well however i cant believe the airconditions was turned off until i urged them to turned it on

the menu is a bit weird so as the dish itself i guess they are confused between fusion and weirdness food tastes ok but not extraordinary

the restaurant menu has sufficient variety but doesnt include any drink no tap water is provided either which means you have to order drink which is quite expensive and subject to additional 15 service charge as such i paid almost extra rmb50 just for mocktail while it is just rmb128 for 3 courses lunch menu sounds a bit unreasonable

i would suggest this place just for casual drink at night better view rather than place for fine dining, we took advantage of shanghai restaurant week to try out this restaurant
the beautiful view so many rave about is actually only for those who sit at the 2 small windows facing the bund so should not really be a major selling point
service was good food was ok some strange fusion combinations but overall tasty and fresh the dessert was a let down it was supposed to be a lemon semifreddo but it was rather a rock hard half sphere of semigluey ice cream
went to the rooftop bar after dinner yes that is the view i was expecting  very nice place
all in all id skip the restaurant wouldnt be good value if it was not for the shanghai restaurant week set menu and head for drinks to the rooftop, four of us 2 couples went to shook during the shanghai dining week dinner was on offer for rmb 258 $40 per person we arrived a little early and the host directed us to the rooftop bar its happy hour every day from 6pm to 8pm with selected beers wines and cocktails at rmb50 the view was spectacular and the drinks at this price in this location were well worth it

we then went down to 5th floor for dinner we were blown away by the number of choices on the set menu three of us started with the pork belly which was outstanding one of our party was vegetarian and had the carrot appetizer which she said was one of the nicest veggie dishes she ever tasted

for the main two of us had the sole with shrimp and crabmeat  truly amazing one of the party had the duck and was also very pleased the veggie pasta dish was ok but not as exciting as the other dishes we had

finally the deserts were also beautifully presented and tasted delightful overall it was a steal at the dining week special prices the same dishes would be probably twice the price on the regular menu we all said we would without doubt return, first off this restaurant does not offer house water and forces you to buy bottled water  this has always been a major turnoff for me when dining out so if you feel the same there is no need to go back to this restaurant we arrived early and was shown to our table looking for the terrace which was one level up from the dining room we decided to go and have a drink to enjoy the bund view before dinner  nice terrace upon our return our table was occupied by another group and we were asked to wait by the bar without much apologies to be fair the wait was less than 10 mins now for the food the foie gras was overcooked the flank steak was excellent the duck breast was undercooked but the leg confit was delicious all the desserts were such a dismal  and we had all three offerings  that the group did not finish any dessert plate it tasted like these three desserts were all frozen prior and then thawed the consistency and texture was just horrible by the end of our meal and upon urging we were given hot water the same one for tea service to sip as drinking water it was served in a tea cup as this is what the staff was allowed to do apparently it is the managements decision to not offer any free house water, visited the roof top bar on a lovely evening the views out over the business district are fantastic and with a clear night they were all lit up to the maximum
the bar was not full which was great but it was wednesday and i bet it gets pretty full later in the week
great place to visit but dont do so when rainy, came here for the shanghai restaurant week dinner very nice decor with good view of the bund we had a good table seeing all the actions inside the kitchen we had salmon and pork belly as our first course both excellent we waited for our main courses for quite a while i orders the sole fish with crab and shrimp stuffing which was very nice and creative my husband ordered the beef korean style and we didnt like it that much as it was not cool when it arrived lying that waiting for my fish and the kimchi risotto came with the beef was just soso desserts were definitely enjoyable i loved my lemon semifreddo its refreshing and light
definitely a creative menu if youre adventurous, great food and great experience fantastic service and reasonably priced good menu with plenty of choices, came here with a business partner and enjoyed a very nice evening i ordered the tartare and the tuna and both dishes were not only nicely presented they were very tasty i usually avoid eating at the bund as it is normally over prized average food here however i would return job well done, i went for brunch with a friend and we had a great time bund view a nice brunch menu tasty food all good can highly recommend, i tried to go to rooftop bar but it was closed due to some rain drops so we opted to go downstairs and grab a drink in the bar on 5th floor as part of the shook instead
the bar was a little dark and have only a few bar stools but the lychee martini was delicious service was prompt and bar tender friendly however i would still love to try the rooftop bar though, loved this place for its view of the bund at night now about food it was not something that stood out but still they had 5 starter dishes for vegetarians and that made my day the service is good too
this place is good for business dinner choose the river view sitting, yesterday afternoon i attended a business lunch for a group of executives at shook it was a really terrific experience and i would highly recommend the place for clientbusiness meetings

before settling on shook i went through a list of other potential options mr  mrs bund under renovation house of roosevelt no private room museo tried to put us in a hallway in the end shook had the best pricing for set lunch�98 rmb for an appetizer and a main with an option pay extra for various steakseafood options�as well as offered a private dining area

the food was fairly good it certainly had the whole fine dining quality you know pretty with small portions i had asked for my steak to be medium rare and it ended up coming out medium which was mildly depressing but everyone else around the table seemed very pleased with preparationtaste of the meal they also offered coffee at the end of the meal for free which was thoughtful at a bund establishment

the real winner of the meal was the service it was excellent by far and away the best i�ve experienced in shanghai except for maybe someplace like azul or goga where the chef personally takes care of you first when we arrived and began the discussion the music was somewhat loud i went over to ask for them to lower it but they had already noticed the volume and were in the process of reducing the decibels throughout the meal we had a gentlemen waiting in the corner who quickly arrived if anyone indicated they needed something overall it felt very five star and i really appreciated how effective the wait staff was

this will definitely be a place that is on the top of my list for business lunches in the future, we had dinner at shook last night hotel concierge called at 2 pm for our table at 8 and we were able to get inand get a table by the window the view alone made the experience worth the price the three course dinner was the perfect way to get a good flavor for the restaurant we had salmon tartare and salad which were both very good my lamb chops were coked perfectly and the seafood in the pasta was very fresh and tasty all the presentations were lovely the only issue was that two of the bottles of wine we requested were not available they were more moderately priced in a more expensive wine list this should tell the management that not everyone wants to pay well over $100 usd for a bottle of wine at an already pricier dinner, we went to the wrong address in search of another bar and found shook what a great accident still serving their restaurant week menu we got lucky with a table with a view of the bund food was delicious and the drinks we some of the best we had in shanghai service was good but spottybut i would go back, we visited on the shanghai restaurant week deal which was great value but as it was tuesday evening it was only half full and did lack atmosphere there are better restaurants on the bund, i had the shanghai restaurant week menu tuna  salmon tartar australian wagyu beef lime  coconut creme brulee shook is by far one of the better tasting fine dining restaurants in shanghai the tartar was fresh and flavourful the wagyu beef was incredibly soft and juicy and they cooked it the way that i wanted not overcooked i want to go back just to have good beef the creme brulee was alright but not outstanding the portions were also good which surprised me i expect the set menus to have smaller portions but shook was pretty substantial for a fine dining restaurant they even gave us a freebie foie gras tortelloni unfortunately the restaurant looks a little tired so i rated the restaurant lower due to its furnishings and ambiance but go there for amazing food in all of my fine dining experiences somewhat limited mind you i can say that only 1 other restaurant rivals the flavours of shook and the restaurant is back in canada so i really want to give it a 455 a suggestion to really push it to a 5 is for the servers to introduce the ingredients of the dishes there are such fine and delicious ingredients an explanation of it would make the dining experience even more compelling and gives greater justification for the 15 service charge, this restaurant is situated at the bund one of the nicest places in shanghai unfortunately the terrace was not open yet we took the set menu offering a choice of 3 appetizers 3 main dishes an 2 desserts certainly recommend, visited shook for dinner and drinks with some friends its not perfect but very nice the view is beautiful we were lucky enough to have one of the seats right next to the window and the selection of food is varied and of high quality i enjoy the mix of western and asian influences and the flavours were all on point ingredients were all fresh the drinks arent fantastic and are certainly hotel prices but its worth it for the atmosphere and all restaurants on the bund are priced in the same range very nice venue for a nonovercrowded restaurantbar on the busy bund, great food great history never disappointed in the food charge a small fortune for water should be arrested for the prices they try to charge for water extortion is being very kind, the view the food the atmosphere all were superb great ala carte menu with a real flair for combinations of different international tastes great spot, the only missing bit was the shanghai tower lights that were not turned on anyhow it wasnt in shooks administration hands to solve it
we were there 5 people 1 scothish 1 australian 1 indian 1 chilean and myself im peruvian the 5 of us were delighted by the quality presentation and the taste of the dishes absolutely a great option in shanhai, the shook it is a nice restaurant and located at the bun area overlooking the river and busy during weekend request the seating near the window area the food is good especially salmon and their some signature dishes ask for ramesh or jimmy as they are an excellent managers, my wife and i ordered a four course al a carte dinner on saturday night the food was quite good but was only warm not hot the plating was very good the portions were small but to be expected at that type of restaurant as an entree i had lamb chops which were truly excellent my wife had tuna which was ok we had a table with an incredible view of the huangpu river the restaurant is roughly divided into thirds a very good view some view and no view request a good view when making reservations the restaurant is pricey our bill came to $313 with one drink and a bottle of sparkling water as a point of interest all of the customers were young chinese we were the only meiguoren and the oldest, there are serious design flaws with this space there are miniature hardtonotice steps throughout the restaurant that make it uncomfortable and dangerous to walk to and from the table the place is dimly lit to the point of being sleepy the staff speaks english they can be overbearing one minute and impossible to find another minute

overall the food is tasty but hardly worth the price the 680 yuan wagyu steak was fine nothing special the watermelon gazpacho was good salads were ok signature noodle soup with thick broth and prawns was perfectly okay but hardly worth 280 yuan they even charge for still water, my husband brother in law and myself had been to shook a few years ago on a sunday for brunch and it was fabulous the great thing about the set menu is it gave you an opportunity to try a few dishes and everything was excellent last night we returned to shook but for dinner and we were very disappointed my father in law decided to try the steak which was over 600 rmb and asked for it to be cooked medium when it came out it was practically raw but not only that it was just a scotch fillet not the quality of steak that was expected having said that the tuna was great and cooked perfectly in my opinion the a la carte menu is overpriced the service was average especially considering the restaurant was very quiet for the money and a far better level of surface i would suggest going to mr  mrs bund instead, i had read a lot about this restaurant on tripadvisor and decided to try it for lunch on our last day the menu was set for sunday lunch but the food was to die for and was not the sort of stuff i would usually order highly recommend this one, the menu and wine list are rather small the pricing is totally unreasonable a bottle of vasse felix cabernet merlot 2011 is approx $130 retail is approx 25  30 a waygu burger for $ 60  really
the food itself is good with some interesting combinations  but again nothing special
the service was friendly but not very attentive nobody came to pour the wine or offer more water men were served first
i would not return, good food and great ambience
good service up to top western levels has a great rooftop terrace for predinner cocktails with incredible views of the skyline, last minute reservations made for outoftown business guests from france got a table on the terrace perfect

now let me tell you what sets this restaurant apart from all the others

we were greeted seated and served by a fantastic gentleman by the name of irbin uvin or irvin im assuming it is irvin as it was a bit windy on the terrace and i didnt quite catch his name this guy made a seemingly stuffy and presumptuous restaurant feel warm and inviting he guided us through the menu made fantastic food recommendations and made me and my guests feel so at home we ended up ordering more drinks than what we planned on having as well as a splurge on dessert i dont know if he was from india or malaysia but his english was perfect and so was his mandarin i wonder how in the world this restaurant found this guy but i hope to god they are paying him well

we ordered the sharing appetizer as recommended by irvin the shrimp were outstanding the scallop perfectly cooked and the foie gras literally melted in my mouth we had waygu rib eyes which were perfectly cooked and the desserts looked awesome i myself skipped the desert for some of the amazing cocktails and i think our server irvin made these as well ginger punch some type of delicious cucumber cocktail some type of basilinfused berry drink coffee martini my god

i have to say this place is not cheap we had such a good time we almost hit the floor when we saw the bill but you know what we had such a great experience had such a great view had such a great server had such a great meal it was absolutely worth it

cant wait to find a reason to go back im just frightened that ill go for one of irvins great cocktails get to talking find myself staying for dinner and voila im down another couple thousand rmb gotta love shanghai, located in the swatch peace hotel  has two floors on the top the rest has an open kitchen layout food was ok  but nothing special go to mr  mrs bund instead  much better experience was not crowded  just like shook in kl the rooftop bar looks great  imagine it could be a very hot place to hang out, i went there for dinner tonight the food was good but two things ruined the dinner for me my first glass of prosecco was flat so they opened a new bottle unfortunately the second bottle was at room temperature so it tasted terrible at that point id had it with bad prosecco so i just stuck to water

the second unfortunate part of the meal was the bread i got a dried up peace of white bread when i asked the waiter for another piece he said the bread in his basket was the same as what i had well it wasnt the one in his basket was fresh and warm and the one on my plate was dry and stale and if i want another piece of bread he should just give it to me the second piece was ok but i was disappointed by the attitude

i now understand why it was the only place i could get a reservation on the spur of the moment, decided to check out shook partly due to its name being a popular word in singaporemalaysia where i grew up but also due to the reviews in tripadvisor talking about its view luckily i was staying about 6 blocks down the bund so it was an nice walk also i had 15hrs to kill waiting on a reservation at another restaurant

first off having been all over the world and taken in some great views this ranks right up there near the top and as for an urban view nothing beats this imho add in a great staff especially the bartender from kl the airy nicely appointed rooftop terrace is a great way to spend an evening the view of the bund is simply brilliant

due to the fabulous evening i was having i was notified by the bartender that we could order from the restaurant menuwin since i was not too hungry i went with the much raved about dancing white prawnsyummm and a nice carpaccio next visit to shanghai and ill try some of their entreesupstairs on the roof of course

later in the night the chef popped up so i had a nice chat with him all in a brilliant night out in shanghai","Turkish cuisine",0.99980715004283
214,"great food you have to order the braise pork the onion fried fish the crabdish as per photo slurp, authentic tasty shanghai cuisine



i have eaten in this restaurant for few times every time when i travel to shanghai i will try to make a booking there are many new restaurants in shanghai offering modern shanghai food but they are not authentic ji shi is old school i was there again last week pork belly stew in wine was tender and mouthwatering fried fishes were crispy and tasty services were not the top but i went there for the food and i was totally satisfied, this place isnt for sissies stay away if youre fussy about redcarpet service standards and hospitalgrade cleanliness but if you want to experience a small and definitely cramped old school and authentic restaurant with food which will blow your tastebuds then this is the place for you i came here with my mother and we were thoroughly impressed with the simple yet sublime food trust us were chinese the long menu of shanghainese delights has something for everyone and has pretty accurate english translations it has plenty of excellent choices for vegetarians too we didnt have a reservation but we were offered a table for a restricted duration of 1 hour immediately or a proper reservation for 8pm the same night i would recommend a reservation thought we got a bit lucky, ji shi has been around for more than a decade and now they have several branches i tried the one at iapm mall i brought my out of town friend to try some shanghainese food there are some staples that should always be ordered like the la zi chicken the pork belly and the fried fish, came here for dinner with a local shanghainese friend because i wanted to experience what the locals eat what a treat very good food which was served very quickly despite being a very busy night the restaurant is very small and tables are very close to each other however the food is very good, best food i have in shanghai unfortunately i dont remember the name of the dish but i have a picture of itbest one we tried the stinky tofu pork belly noodles chicke the tsingtao beer was cold and great too, we had dinner for 12 at ji shi old jesse most of us were expats but ordering was done ably by a local shanghainese and another fluent speaker first we had to wait in the cold outside for 25 minutes past our reservation time ok it is hard to gage timing on the one large table downstairs but still no client management or appreciation of our situation from the restaurant food was very good but not brilliant definitely have the tofu with crab the shanghai fried rice was pretty good service was efficient but not friendly but i can deal with that unfortunately the person taking the order decided since we were foreigners it was ok to increase the order and add items and pressure the two orderers to increase the amount ordered be very careful here at the end it appeared there were quantities we did not order and the bill was inflated by over 10 we were fortunate to have native speakers to work things out and ended with a reasonable but not really cheap meal by shanghai standards it is a real experience and i would not discourage anyone from going as the food is good but the locals with us thought they would not go back as there are better and easier shanghainese restaurants, loved this place the restaurant is unpretentious and cozy and despite its reputation it wasnt full of tourists  plenty of shanghainese patrons the night we were there the food was fresh and surprisingly delicate thanks to another trip advisor reviewer we ordered the crab and tomato soup which i would otherwise not have noticed it was spectacular  light and delicate and perfectly seasoned the veggies were also very good of all the meals we had in shanghai this was the best  the most unique and the most notably different from the chinese food weve had at other good chinese restaurants, we went there for lunch and were lucky to get the last table downstairs just before the lunch crowd set in after 1200 pm the restaurant is very small with only five tables downstairs not sure how many tables they have upstairs but i would guess not too many more service staff do not speak english however the menu is in english but since there are no pictures it is not really a big help we just ordered a few vegetable dishes and plain rice and the waiter recommended braised pork in a brown sauce which was very tasty but very very fatoverall the food is a bit fat so not a place you would eat at every day was a nice experience though food was ok but the place was very cramped and people kept coming in and going out nonstop long queues outside waiting for a free table for as simple as it is the food is not cheap though would not go again just followed a recommendation in time magazine of things to do in shanghai, we asked our hotel to book a table for lunch and preordered the fish head with scallions couldnt fault the experience  began with the fish which was delicious and so so tender next we had a bowl of noodles also with scallions which we ate with the most amazingly tender pork with brown sauce and followed with a great chicken and fried shrimp dish which were butterflied before being cooked this feast was washed down with tea and the bill came to under 500rmb
we were seated upstairs in a corner table and the service was as good as we could have expected given our language limitations the lengthy menu had english descriptions so it wasnt too difficult to get what we wanted
highly recommended  but if your mandarin isnt too flash suggest you get your hotel to make the reservation for you, ate here for our very last dinner in shanghai before we go back the next day the food was excellent despite the crab skin on average only the food like the appetizers and the hong shao meat was in excellent quality the service was good despite the environment very crowded with lots of people the price is cheap and reasonable, tasty savory delicious mouthwatering yummy shanghainese food service is not there but youre not here for that youre here for the food and there is no better shanghainese food in shanghai i lived in shanghai for two years and this would be one of my goto spots it is oily and heavy though so i dont recommend eating this everyday

and just fyi the other jesse restaurants do not compare dont go theyre not the same

enjoy, this review is only about the service at old jesse not the food for reasons obvious below

based on a recommendation we booked for dinner last week at the restaurant when we arrived it was packed with no empty tables it is a very small restaurant and there is only elbow room between the cramped tables we told the waitress about our booking but she very rudely told us to wait outside subtext � �get out of my way and don�t disturb me�

we went outside in the rain under our umbrellas waiters came in and out sending food for delivery but they all ignored us until someone with a list came out for a smoke he also ignored us until i asked him about our booking he replied that they had no booking under our name i insisted we had a confirmed booking but he refused to believe us conclusion � they had either lost our booking or bumped us off to make way for someone else more important either of which is inexcusable when i asked how much longer we had to wait for a table he replied very brusquely �one hour� all these conversations with the staff were in mandarin which we speak so it wasn�t a case of language misunderstanding

we looked at the crowded and very cramped conditions inside the restaurant assessed the dreadful attitude of the staff and decided we did not want to wait one hour outside in the rain for the privilege of dining seated like canned sardines in an environment where we had to be grateful to receive the slightest bit of respect from the staff we went off to eat somewhere else

if you had to rate a restaurant on the three qualities of food service and ambience i can�t comment on the first as i never did get to sample their food but my rating for the last two wouldn�t even move the dial as the saying goes �success breeds contempt�, its yummy but i found the food abit oily and salty which is quite a characteristic of shanghai cuisine apparently u cant do walk in only by reservation think this is the flagship store worth a try if u are in the french concession area, chances are unless youre a local you wont know about jesse restaurant a small and famous restaurant that dates back to the precommunist era

this is a local place so dont attempt to go here without a reservation also you need to order certain dishes like their braised fish head amazing at least a day in advance

have been here going on 10 times and its always one of the best shanghainese restaurants in the city, look no further for the always best  always enjoyable shanghainese cuisine  41 tian ping lu every dish is deliciously prepared  recently they even set up a fine wine shop cum rest just opposite fto go along with your food wow , just off huahei road opposites eddys is a quaint old school shanghainese restaurant nothing fancy but serving food that you may have had years ago so forget about food presentation or fancy trappings instead what you have is the meat and bones of shanghainese staples we had all the standards and each dish was well prepared and delicious the prawn and chicken in chilli the egg and tofu pork belly were all the basics that one would expect from any shanghainese restaurant but the restaurant was packed with locals quietly savouring the flavors you were therefore comforted by the thought that this was where the locals went what a great testament of good food prepared well, overuse of sugar soy sauce makes everything taste the same look the same horrible horrible food this is not even decent shanghainese total rip off trading off an old name go somewhere else, one of the best restaurants i have ever been to although i only went there twice but my friends and i concurred that the food was really special, serves good traditional shanghai style cuisine though the restaurant itself is a bit crampedand the food somewhat greasy comparing to what im accustomed to taiwanese cuisine recommended, we went here with a local friend who was able to order and translate and so bad service was no issue for us in fact the service was good and the food even better especially the hairy crab and the braised pork a must go to if you can get a table and find it, as the title of my review says if i was asked where somoene should go for lunchdinner and they were nearby this place i would defintely suggest it if someone was across town i am not sure i would direct them all here a small  blink and you miss it entrance  you are still greeted inside by an 80 full restuarant at lunch time food was great but service a bit lethargic which doesnt help boost ones energy at lunch time also when pointing to the items on the menu it doesnt help that full attention is not given one wrong dish was brought out and then one dish forgotton the forgotten dish was then found twice on the invoice not a huge deal they were very apologetic and removed it immeadiately and again food was great i would come back but would not go out of my way, the food here is the best shanghai food ive ever had but the service is a huge turnoff its ok to be curt and professional but i find the staff here blantantly rude the seating arrangements are really cramped  even by chinese standards, this is still one of the best places for classical shanghainese cuisine the room is not the most impressive and the service perhaps not always all that attentive but the food here is superb the <u+7ea2><u+70e7><u+8089>pork belly is a mustorder, similar post was posted by myself at chowhound

after researching this board and food blogs i decided to cap off my vacation in shanghai with a visit to old jesse it was a tough booking for reservations for the restaurant even on a week day surprisingly i wanted to preorder some of the dishes i had read about namely the roasted scallion fish head and the eight treasure duck i had called on monday for seats and the dishes werent available until friday i was flying out saturday so i thankfully agreed to a reservation i confirmed multiple times that the dishes would be there for that time

you can imagine my dismay when i showed up for my reservation and ordered the dishes i preordered and was told in a rather rude tone no none left despite my protests that they were ordered nearly a week in advance on top of the fact that they were a large part of why i was there at the restaurant the waitstaff didnt care what came out was the polar opposite of an apologyother customers didnt eat it either were out no sorry no suggestion nothing

and since it was getting late we decided to stay and order some dishes about 2030 of the dishes we picked were not available on the menu and in the end settled for 2 cold dishes chilled sauteed bean curd and fried beancurd wrapped stinky tofu 2 warm dishes eight treasure pork trotter and red cooked pork and 1 vegetable dish stirfried pea shoots with a house fried rice

as though to add insult to injury they brought all the dishes but the vegetable upon questioned after everything else has been brought and consumed they literally said they were out and turned and walked away they didnt care about our protests that we ordered it an hour ago and if they were out we would have gladly ordered another dish should we have not already finished the rest of the meal when we asked if it can be taken off our bill the waiter retorted stop being so calculating about the money i was left speechless

the food that was served was well made and flavorful however dinner was decidedly lacklustre secondary to the environment wait staffs attitude and the various incidents above i had been looking forward to this meal for at least two months and to say i was disappointed is an understatement since it was our last meal in the city i didnt want to get into an argument with the waitstaff the two foh that were present in the restaurant were equally appalling at least the bill was reasonable 400 rmb for 4 people

i definitely would not recommend, we went together with some collegues to the jesse restaurant it atmosphere is rather simple but the food is delicious and the staff is friendly i come again, in the french concession a small 2 floor restaurant very simple but well visited and the food is to die for mmmmmmmm best meal in china an advise reservation is needed tel 62829260 they hardly speak english so let the concierge in your hotel do the reservation by the way their is no bar and outdoor sitting, first the foods are pretty good
almost everything ive ordered was up to par or under par except some vegetable dish the server suggested
the menu is quite long and not easy to get for foreigners as theres no picture of any sort
it may be easier to try the dishes mentioned in time magazines article
httpcontenttimecomtimetravelcityguidearticle03148918519081851830185182500html
service here was kind of funny
im not sure if its customary thing in china throwing menus to customers
i get the fellow travellers review on the service as if theyre not welcomed there
but it seemed to get better with some chinese greetings and reading menus in chinese reading out the ones in time magazine article
all in all the foods here was the best over the one in shanghai financial center and other places on my 5 day visit in shanghai, i was very much looking forward to eating at this restaurant supposedly one of the best examples of shanghainese cuisine sadly this dinner turned out to be one of the worst experiences in all our travels

essentially we were treated with extreme rudeness bordering on an attitude of we dont want you here as frequent travellers we know how to behave in restaurants smile be polite try a few words of the local language engage warmly with your server eat what the locals are having dont impose your cultural standards etc etc so when this all failed dismally we were left wondering what we did wrong and could only conclude that it was not about us it was clearly about them not wanting us to be there

we waited just over an hour for the bulk of our food to be served apart from a cold dish nothing really to complain about here slow service often means good food but when every other table in the restaurant three of whom came up to 40 minutes after we did got their food within 1015 minutes of ordering we knew something was up it is a small place and my back was facing the window so i could see every table perfectly to add much insult and offence the waiter got a chinese customer to translate the reason why we waited so long because we had ordered extra special dishes ah yes that would be the fried rice and the brown sauce braised pork both of which were delivered multiple times to other tables who came after us and ordered considerably after us if i hadnt been so hungry and it hadnt been such a miserable rainy night outside and we didnt have a plan b on us we would have left the food arrived just about an hour after we sat down it was ok compared to other meals we had nothing certainly nothing to justify the extreme rudeness which was almost farcical westerners do yourself a favour if you want great shanghainese give this a wide berth and go to yun se instead where the food was absolutely fantastic and they were friendly and warm, local friends have recommended this restaurant as one of the best in shanghai for local food we arrived at the cramped place and were lucky enough that they kept our reservation because it is small and certainly it was packed however food was not that fantastic but pretty average and quite pricey for what it was exception was the pork in sauce which was really tasty but as a culinary experience i felt a bit dissappointed here, i would have thought fish head tasted so good but not only that the braised pork and jishi fried rice were all amazingdefinitely taking friends when they the come to visit very small so very wise to book ahead otherwise you would be left waiting and also ordered the fish head when you call service still lacks but we got our food in time awesome place, some people say this place is overrated and touristy but i still feel that this is one of the best shanghaiese traditional food the huadiao with the sour plum is a must to go with the food you must try the jellyfish cold dish drunken crab and the fish with a ton of spring onion are the absolute best, cozy little restaurant that offers very authentic shanghainese food i am not particularly a huge fan of shanghainese because many of the dishes are sweat opposed to the spicy taste of sicuan food that being said this place knows how to make the classics and it seems as though they have been doing it for quite a while

they also cater to foreigners so you wont have to worry about having to look at an all chinese menu, on a friend raccomandation i went to this place as the food is good and value too

we start to enjoy our lunch then we have discovered a den of crabs coming and going without stopping from a hole in the wall right next to our table

we left really disappoint as is not accettable that no one from service is aware of that

it was the table in the corner on the first floor of the restaurant

not raccomanded for people looking for a clean restaurant, excellent pork with brown sauce  shanghai version of us bbq  sweet and tangy the crab potato and tomato soup was superb needed a little salt for my taste but easy enough to add the jujube dessert was quite good the salty chicken another signature dish was a cold dish consisting primarily of dark meat i liked it but not as memorable as the others the hairy crab in wine sauce was very nice  i ordered the steamed version rather than raw the restaurant itself is nothing to write home about by the way the one person bathroom is a joke  if you are 6 ft or above there is no way to sit on the toilet glad that i did not need to use it, tucked in a beautiful location at tianping luthis charming restaurant has gained many followers due to its havenly crabs and dishes
it is a small old double storeyed terraced shophouse and it can only accomodate not more than 15 small tablesas such one cannot be assured of getting a place prior to bookingsso booking is quite mandatory especially for dinners
however the interior is simple and cosyit reminds me of grandmas home anyway and who doesnt have fond memories of that
a few momentos and decorations like been voted best shanghai tatler restaurant etc is placed nonchalantly on the wall
having been touted as a paradise for crabs it has kept up with its repuatations with ease
some of the my favourite dishes here like the fried hairy crabs in steamed eggs at 138 yuan is finger licking good
others not to be missed are the braised king prawns in chilli sauce at 88 yuansweet and sour crabs at 198 yuanand crab meat in sheet jelly at a staggering price of 398 yuanbut upon tasting it it certainly justifies its value
soups collection are commendable like the clam and preserved bamboo shoots and duck soupfish head and sheet jelly soupcrucian carp cream soupcrab meat and bean curd soup etc
other delicacies like the mandarin fish at 178 yuan and exotic food like the turtle in steamed brown sauce at 380 yuan
snail meat in hot baked chives at 48 yuan
poultry offerings like fried prawns and chicken and fried chicken and scallions are also great
so far whatever we ordered it feels great i really cant find a fault in this restaurant other than the service is mediocrehowever the only reason that we come here repeatedly is for the food and my loving crabs, this is my favorite restr in sha i missed it so much that we purposely detour to sha just to dine there i have to book 1 month in advance and we were lucky to dine here 2 times in a week very happy and satisfied this is the place you must not miss if you love shanghai cuisines but be warned it is a tiny restr in a old building and you will sit really close to the next table
this is a place for good food not for entertaining guest as they will need you to give up the table in 15hr, if you are looking for good service you can forget about this place you come to jesse strictly for the food the shanghainese food here is always good and consistent the restaurant is located in a great neighborhood  dont forget to make reservation before going as its a tiny restaurant with too many people wanting to eat there do not allow the service staff to annoy you as they will most definitely try, very nononsense kind of place good food we mostly ordered shanghainese dishes speedy service even if a bit rough cold beers great location, we found this place on the internet and i didnt have very high expectations as most chinese restaurants where i have been week all kinda the same not bad but after 3 months in china a bit boring this place is different not only is it in a lovely neighborhood it is also small clean and i has an atmosphere of a secret hidden place for people who know what they get there as it doesnt look very flashy from the outsidelike most chinese restaurants the food was beyond interesting yes it was tasty too but the best feature was that i have never eaten something even remotely similar so it was full of surprises the highlight was the fish headit sounds weird but it was probably one of the best fish dishes i ever tasted when my boyfriend told me when we went there that we are going for some fish head i was slightly annoyed and expected a subway sandwich right after but it ended up being one of the best chinese restaurants where i have ever been, i must clarify that im usually not a huge fan of shanghainese food but i do enjoy jesse i usually take out of town guests there since its difficult to book ive been here many times and yes they dont excel in every dish but the ones they do are oh so yums this last trip we ordered the alcohol fermented rice steamed fish its a pricey sucker but very fragrant and succulent my faves are the red dates stuffed with mochi  xin tai ruan jellyfish and kaofu for the appetizers we also ordered the stinky tofu wrapped with tofu skin that was absolutely delicious as well the sichuan style spicy fried tiger prawns and chicken was addictive we also ordered the braised fatty pork with bamboo shoots this was rich and sweet that went well with rice in the past ive ordered the pig hock stuffed with sticky rice it was very good as well ive also had their scallion roasted fish head that needs to be preordered its very oily and rich as well but mouth watering then we ended the meal with fermented rice with mochi balls filled with sesame i think this is my favorite shanghainese restaurant if you are a large party the space may be a bit claustrophobic and especially the bathroom but i dont come for the ambiance but the food only service is hit or miss as well, i have heard of this restaurant many times and finally had the chance to try it and i was not disappointed we booked the table for 730pm and we still had to wait for 30 min for the table it was ok though as the food made up for it the decore was ok not fancy and the ceiling of the upper deck was a bit low so if you are tall better watch your head

we ordered drunkie crab which was very very delicious and im not usually a fan of raw crab the sweet taste of the wine made it enticing and i could not help going for seconds and thirds

the pork knuckle was nice too but unfortunately we had to chase them a few times and finally came way too late in the meal so we couldnt finish it as we were all stuffed by then

the other dishes we ordered were all nice all the food met exceeded our expectations only if the food had came in a better order and a bit quicker we had to chase a few times for the waiters to check with the kitchen and still nothing came after half an hour, i guess i am not just fond of shanghainese food if this is supposed to be the best shanghainese restaurant the restaurant is small with not much decor or service to speak of the food is oily heavy and on the sweet side the best dish we had was perhaps the cold tofu dish but thats about it gimme din tai fung or crystal jade food anytime but ill pass on jesse on my next visit, if youre looking for authentic local food then you must try jesse in the french concession
the food is fresh and tasty with a good selection of meats vege and seafood dishes
surprising though it didnt have a broad shanghai dumpling selection but i suppose it isnt a dumpling restaurant
be prepared to wait as it only has a small number of tables and is very popular given the size of the restaurant it is a wait on the sidewalk but it adds to the charm if you want authenticity
if you are use to the waiters in soho restaurants in new york then you wont be surprised or offended by the curt responses you get here although why do they need to be nice 
i thoroughly enjoyed the place and will be back
oh and there is a begger who hangs out near the front door  as doggy bags are the norm in shanghai if you dont finish your food i decided to give the guy mine and he was thrilled might be an idea, heard of this place from friends and decided that to try it

it is a small little restaurant along a quite street theres a crowd of people outside the restaurant luckily we made a reservation earlier on it was said that one has to booked 1 week in advanced for this place we were there for 9pm dinner

the food was typically shanghainese we had quite a few dishes and they were all very tasty the cold dish mainly vegetables and pickles was good we also had their famous pork ribs which was tender and juicy we wanted to order fish but ran out by that time stinky toufu was another of their specialty it was really quite stink but the taste was good
we also had some gooey stuff think it was some sort of starch cant remember the name but it was really quite tasty
overall the service was prompt and quick no fuss the place was a little tight but the food was really good we paid about rmb700 for 4 which i thought was quite decent, does jesse live up to the hypewell perhaps the consensus on the internet appears to be that jesse  tian ping lu  serves the very best shanghainese cuisine in shanghai we are western foodies who always go out of our way to seek out the very best restaurants serving local cuisine and were therefore anticipating our culinary experience at jesses first you need to be aware that reservations here are a must and need to be made some time in advance we had our hotel make them a week before our arrival since our mandarin is probably not up for the task we had to take a taxi to jesses due to time limitations but you could just as well end up there by taking line 1 to the xujiahui station jesses was immediately identifiable several blocks in advance of our arrival by the crowd milling out front our reservation was for 7 pm and we had decided to arrive considerably earlier despite our design there were already dozens of others waiting to be seated little plastic chairs and stools were provided on the sidewalk for the luck few a fellow with a clipboard came around and checked off your name and then immediately at 7 pm the restaurant emptied of the previous patrons and the waiting crowd was allowed to enter there are apparently at least two seatings  and on some nights three for the privilege of eating at jesses this is a place where you do not linger longer you do your business and you are out of there jesses is housed in three different unassuming rooms having a somewhat appealing boardinghouse look lets be clear you are not coming here for the ambiance this is not a romantic dinner kind of place but a no frills eatery serving pretty good shanghainese food despite our limited mandarin we had no trouble navigating the menu or placing our order being only two we were limited in the dishes we could sample the hongshao rou  pork belly slowly braised in dark vinegar soy and sugar probably the signature dish of shanghai was excellent  although perhaps not the very best for that try sincere well cooked with a very tasty sauce although if your western palate has an aversion to large chunks of pork fat this may not be the dish for youthe salted chicken and the dates with rice cakes were also noteworthy the vegetable dish with mushrooms was equally well done the beer was cold what more could be said the fare at jesses probably represents the best of home cooked shanghainese food it is probably food your shanghai mama would rustle up if she happened to be a real good cook was the effort to eat at jesses worth it probably yes will we return probably no after all there are numerous other great eateries in shanghai waiting to be experienced, went to this smallish restaurant in shanghai 2 levels sitting about 20 tables and is very tight they serve good shanghainess cuisine including one i tried for the first time  raw crab seasoned in wine and vinegar the rest are rather typical but good food like braised pork  dongpuorou etc the service is also good and friendly and never passed an opportunity to upsellcrosssell so dont get carried away a meal for 6 cost about usd300 without wine and fancy dishes and remember you cannot walk in only reservation, our friend from shanghai took us to jesse for lunch be forewarned jesse is not a fancy restaurant with stuffy waiters to fuss over it the waiters may appear aloof and unfriendly but on the contrary they are very professional know their menu inside out and attentive to customers requests it is a no frills restaurant that serves superb shanghainese dishes everything here is outofthisworld delicious we had smoked pomfret cured baby shrimp soy sauce fried gluten with black fungus  peanuts ground pork wrapped in white beancurd skinsuper yummy bean sheets with fresh crabmeat and crab roesuper yummy belly pork and hardboiled eggs in soy saucesuper yummy cured pork and green veg soup and red bean pancake for dessertyummy we love the food at jesses more than fu 1088 reservations are a must must try, excellent food and service we got in without a booking on a busy night but it was not a huge squeeze outstanding honey glazed ham with crackling  the kids has seconds also grandmas pork  yum only wish i could work out how to get the rice at the beginning rather end of a meal, the restaurant has three separate rooms for dining all of them very small but the food is well worth the squeeze they can have food to your table five minutes after the order is placed because they have such small amount of dining area they have to be fast in order to get the tables to turn over the giant prawns cooked in rice wine residue is out of this world crabmeat over snow pea tips is worth being squeezed into our chairs a must try when coming to shanghai","French cuisine",0.999774080904597
215,"my friends and i enjoyed brunch at als diner the ricotta lemon blueberry pancakes were a hit with everyone almost every table ordered them so we couldnt pass them up daily specials are offered some of us ordered burgers and sandwiches others ordered breakfast burrito or egg scramble service was slow but the food was worth it would definitely recommend, the food is really good i think we picked the busiest time or something was going on because services were slow but the food was worth it and they have a ice cream bar lol, this place was recommended to us it did not disappoint

3 people had the veggie burrito monte cristo and patty melt along with a rootbeer float and a mango coconut smoothie everything was insanely delicious

the only compliant was that the service was super slow i think there was something going on behind the scenes the server was apologetic but trust me the quality and flavour of the food makes up for any shortcomings

wish i could eat here everyday honestly

if youre thinking of trying this place doooo iiiiiitttt, my favorite breakfast spot in shanghai the omelets are delicious and the pancakes are to die forthe restaurant is small so reserve a table on line or be prepared to wait
great place, been a couple of times usually for brunch which is excellent they have two locations not far from one another so if one is packed ask the waitress for directions and avoid waiting, come several times and never disappointed small cozy restaurant with big portion of good foods from breakfast burger pancakes soup fries dessert ice cream etc all you can find it here the waiters also friendly my all time favorites are 2 eggmeat taters and toats blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes and frenchcurly fries the pancakes coming in 3 layer of huge and thick slice should make reservation before coming

for those who like pancakes can try their super pancakes challenge

happy hour  monday through friday 4 to 7 pm 2for1 house wines and beer, portions are quite big ordered the hotdog and fries and was quite surprised at the size for how cheap it was
not somewhere where you would sit for too long and have a few drinks though but great for a quick meal, my husband had a breakfast for dinner and was very pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the buttermilk pancakes the excellent bacon and wellcooked eggs a very rare find in china i had the codfish tacos with a side order of mac and cheese and thought it was delicious the portions were very generous and the prices very reasonable we were not there at a busy time but we thought the service was good the restaurant is 5 min walking distance from the howard johnsons hotel where we stayed so very convenient on the first floor as you walk in is an awesome bakery owned by the same folks with american style baked goods such as key lime pie carrot cake maple bacon doughnuts red velvet cake and so many many more goodies as americans living in china we were delighted to find this treasure while visiting shanghai we will definitely be returning, visited als diner recently staff were really friendly and the menu offers a good selection of western casual food from pancakes to burgers and their recommended cheesecake nice cosy atmosphere i would recommend to anyone craving a western treat and a chilled out atmosphere, i love the food here the sandwiches and burgers are good greasy and fulfilling and pancakes and french toasts are massive
the service is quite slow on very busy days but staff is wonderful and very helpful
this is the best option for hangover brunch in shanghai try monte christo sandwich you wont regret it
small comment on pancakes serving would be better without stacking them as they stay undone in between, let me first start out by saying that i normally review a place based on multiple offerings diversity of menu options for various interests and service  as well as the quality of the food when i visited als diner today that went out the window

i went with every intention of having pancakes or some other breakfast fare but at the last minute i went for the big al burger  exactly as it was presented on the menu with this i ordered fries and a gingerchocolate milkshake yes  i was being very bad

so after a few moments of anxious anticipation my shake arrives  it is wonderful rich thick and uniquely flavored a home run

a couple more minutes go by and a burger is brought before me  perfectly cooked bun expertly toasted meat perfectly seasoned and a special sauce with a kick  add to this some very flavorful pickles and so i bit into this thing of beauty 

pause here while my breath is taken away

all i can say is that a burger is one of my absolutely favorite foods  and this one was beyond extraordinary seriously one of if not the best burger i have ever had  emma keys in greensboro hamilton tavern in baltimore and holman and finch in atlanta

i used to think beef and liberty had the best burger in shanghai  but it is not even close

the shake was amazing  also better than the similar beef and liberty shake which i love  and the fries were very good give the edge to beef and liberty here

so while i know service is not the best and some of the other items on the menu run the gambit from very good to average sausage patty is over seasoned the burger is freaking fantastic

so my rating is for the one and only meal i will ever order from als  the big al burger and shake i will go to the gym for a couple extra hours so i can get back perfect for the morning after a night on the town

sorry about no picture  i ate it too fast i will go back for another,  of us went for brunch this morning we started by ordering 3 coffees one ice tea and a glass of wine it took 20 minutes to get the drinks next we ordered food after about 20 more minutes not bad we received 4 dishes the easiest of the order classic grilled cheese never came after 15 minutes we asked if it was coming the waitress had no idea what a classic grilled cheese was so she just walked away we finally flagged down our original waitress and she didnt even need to come over she said classic grilled cheese then went to the kitchen after another 10 minutes watching other dishes go out to other tables we told her to cancel it we ended up splitting each others dishes to share with the person missing a meal then the waitress showed up with the grilled cheese keep in mind the tiny restaurant was full but there were 7 wait staff and most of them were standing around too many great restaurants to make a mistake like this, yum just yum the pancakes are super delicious though i wish theyd given us more maple syrup my kids love it there and eat happily which is no mean feat believe me the milkshakes are so thick the straws stand up mmmmmm, i was trying to email als directly but they have no email address to contact them at on their website which needs to be added thus als diner this is for you first thank you for now offering a veggie option other than pancakes to your menu the burrito is delicious your pancakes are amazing too second there is one thing missing from your menu bloody marys your diner is the perfect place to go for a saturday or sunday hangover cure which you even offer but really whats a good diner meal on a weekend without bloody marys i hope you will take this into consideration as i see you do serve alcohol infused milk shakes but who wants a sweet milky concoction to help rid a headache or just relax over a delicious meal hope to come back soon for a meal and a substantial bloody mary not just tomato juice and vodka thank you, i am yet to try out any of the food from this place but i did try out their ice cream this is by far one of the better ice creams ive had to date in shanghai the diner also runs a buy one get one free special on burgers every monday and the same for ice creams on wednesday, we are fortunate to live about a block from als diner and eat there at least once a week weve liked everything weve ordered from burgers to tuna melts to chicken fried steak to the incredible blueberry ricotta pancakes which are so massive that one order should be shared between 2 people there are some interesting spins on some of the dishes such as chorizo gravy for for the biscuits and gravy the servers are very friendly and most know a bit of english and dont forget to get some gracies ice cream in the back before you leave, our first visit to als diner was tonight we were impressed i had the monte cristo served with strawberry sauce my partner had the gracies burger both were quite good and came with a huge helping of crispy french fries

the restaurant is smallintimate and the service is good prices are reasonable for the area plus they serve breakfast all day
we will be back for brunch, the place is quite small and i came during busy hour at lunch time it was very warm that day and the staff ensured i get an indoor seat all the staff were very accomodating and friendly always smiling and very attentive to my need had my drinking glass refilled with water several times without me calling for them plus they speak english quite well which is not so common in shanghai

i had the purgatory eggs excellent recommendation from the staff the chorizo in it was very good it was very tasty although pricey for an omelet but everything seems pricey in shanghai anyway i paid around rmb 65 for it

location requires some walking you either get off at changshu station exit 4 or jingan station exits 8 or 9 then walk approximately around 700m1km

at the end of the diner is an ice cream ahop gracies which serves really good ice cream

i highly recommend for a proper break from chinese food their menu has a lot of choices i am coming back for the pancakes, i was told als diner is located where a lot of french people stay indeed i saw ladies walking their french bulls around the area caucasians cycling around it is a very free spirited area

i think all of us know how oily the local food is so when my friend brought me to this restaurant i thank god for a hearty and clean meal

their pancakes are huge and filling i almost burst my stomach trying to finish the pancakes myself my friends ordered their beef burger and its awesome as well

their staffs knows english and they are very friendly love the atmosphere from als diner, i love this place so much the first time that i came back a second day just for the pancakes this place is by far the best pancake house in china the service was quick and the wait staff were friendly its a popular place so if youre going with a group of people its best to call and get a reservation, als diner does really good western food such as burgers and sandwiches service is really nice we paid the wrong bill and they chased after us to refund our over payment if you want a break from chinese food or just want some comfort food this is a great place to go, kind attention of the waitress fast service excellent food nice small burger joint the place to go to if you are feeling homesick  or if you just want to enjoy an excellent burger, small diner in the french concession area of shanghai milkshakes spikes with bourbon  yes please tomato soup was a big portion and delicious chicken skin was crispy and excellent the monte crisco was not deep fried but still yummy everything was good a place to go when you need a little bit of american food, this place has great food we visited this place 4 times in the week that we were in shanghai my first visit i had the big al burger and vanilla milkshake wow the burger was juicy and huge second visit i had the going bananas french toast the combination of flavors was a party in my mouth my friend ordered that breakfast sandwich the bite was amazing as i admired the lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes from afar that day we visited again so that i could try those bad boys holy moly they were huge hot and delicious so my fourth and final visit to this heaven in shanghaii ate them again my pants dont fit but the food was worth it, cute place with good service tables are pretty close together and you should probably make a reservation if youre going on the weekend favorite dishes  patty melt asian salad with chicken and wonton strips and their ice cream, went there almost by accident had the chickenchicken fried steak usually i an not a fan of fried food like this but this was excellent my friend had a spiked milkshake

the service was very good also although it was not busy on a wednesday night

the restaurant is simple and clean the food is great but expensive then again shanghai is probably the most expensive place on earth for food

enjoy this, i went there twice  once on january first and the service was supe slow i guess they were short of staff and one more time few weeks ago to give them another chance and the experience was much better food is typical american fast food burgers are good and fries also, went for a friends and family brunch small place and very packed on weekends still the traffic is moving fast enough you can get a seat

food quality is good but limited no poached eggs no steak and eggs what they do have however seems to be very good quality and the staff while hard to get their attention when its packed are very nice and helpful pancakes and french toast look like the best i have seen in shanghai however i will need to return to try more dishes and confirm

some basic tips for the management

1 if you are serving toast you should offer butter and jam dont make the customer hunt it down and by the time they get it the bread is no longer warm

i also tried the valrhona dark chocolate mouse dont hold your breath i am a chocolate lover and this was surprisingly mediocre ice cream looks nice with a lot of selection, went in als diner 1st dec after lunch to try their gracies icecream the whole experience is just strange we chose 2 small icecream rocky road  nutella went to sit inside right in front of the icecream fridge
first of all the guy who served us the icecream cups was nice but he had long finger nails
then a lady who acted like the managerowner of the restaurant went in front of the icecream fridge and touched the whole fridge with her hands and band over the counter she then went near the kitchen to get her plate of food went back to the icecream fridge to ask the staff to do some stuff again while banding over the counter we didnt feel like seeing all that and left right after we finished our icecream
suggestion managerowner take the little corner in front of the icecream fridge so the customers dont have to see all the actions behind the scene
dont think well be back even though the icecream wasnt bad at all","vegetarian restaurant",0.798256004180944
216,"best sushi and sashimi this was our splurge meal while in shanghai expensive but food was outstanding, my company had booked us a table for 2 at the nadaman restaurant within the impressive shangrila hotel located on the 2nd floor you really do have a feeling of entering a little corner of japan the decor is very authentic

i waited at the desk at the entrance to be brought to my table but the young lady was quite engrossed in doing something on an electronic device but my dining companion noticed that i had arrived and took me to our reserved table

we both scoured the menu and decided against the set menus in favour of our own selection from the a la carte we ended up choosing fish based dishes including cod delicious but mini portion assorted tempura tuna  salmon sushi and sweet shrimp for drinks we shared a small bottle of sake

our waitress was a very young lady dressed in a beautiful kimono she helped us with our choice in a very polite and discreet manner including suggesting that our initial attempt at selecting our meal would not be much

having said that with a bill around the equivalent of 180 euro i was shocked given that the quantity of food we ate was very modest to say the least but then this is within the 5 star luxury of the shangrila hotel, the nadaman was a great surprise for lunch we walked in and lunch was excellent fine dining japanese it doesnt get much better a must try when in shanghai, every time in shanghai i eat at this place the check tops 100 bucks and there not that many guests but sushi and sashimi sets are very good the quality of the food justify the price fully, food was okay sushi was in my opinion workable but definitely not top grade and i believe shameful for a brand like shangri la

service was fair not fantastic

i would reckon the cooked food would fair much better than the sushi, had been there with my business partners
wish i would not had the idea to go to there
selected wine and food from their menus white wine and teppanyaki
5 min later waiter came back telling me its sold out anyway can happen so my thought select another one 5 min later waiter came back telling me its sold out
i asked if it isnt better if they tell me which one is available waiter disappeared10 min nothing happened
i went to the manager who observed all this beconly a few guests had been sold n the restaurant obviously he was aware about their worst service but had been cowardly to take over any responsibility
the little waitress could not do anything as she was simply not briefed about the restaurant and internals
so far nothing reached our table
waiter cam back with a bottle sweet wine
we refused to accept and and ordered another wine which hey provided from another restaurant informed by the manager and as it had been a german riesling kabinett known as white wine with sweet taste we accepted to avoid another 30 min waiting time
finally water and this wine reached our table
the food was acceptable but not more
compared with professional teppanyaki restaurant it had just one point in common
the very high price
we paid the bill and i went to the little waitress girl and have her a good tip and proposed her to look for another job where not she has to do the job over the useless cowardly manager, this is the first time i have had a tepanyaki table all to myself my wife would not come with me on this business trip so i was left to dine all on my one the chef has had 10 years tepanyaki experience and it showed i had an excellent tepanyaki meal my best ever and would go back again, good for lunch i would not attempt for dinner  many better options in shanghai handsome space but dated and not very warm  too much stone large dining rooms and private rooms  space is too large and gives the appearance of being halfempty

set lunch options are varied and pleasant service is spotty  i have been to many other japanese restaurants across asia where service is uniformly superior

allinall a safe place for an efficient business lunch  but do make sure the staff are attentive for you, the food was fresh and tasty but fairly ordinary the staff were unattentive seemed shortstaffed and their english was very poor which i only mention because this restaurant is in a 5 star hotel so id expect better service, i ordered the salmon and shiitake on a skewer perfect local quality meal before retiring for the evening mr hirai was my server and he was outstanding, good food good service worth visiting enthusiastic greetings upon arrival at the entrance hot towels offered at the table and hot green tea too food was beautifully presented and delicious, mostly empty place with an average atmosphere redesign maybe a good idea good times for this restaurant are really over service is poor and food quality max little above average only the invoice shows that this restaurant should meet high expectations of guests i learned that this place has a new chef  maybe he need more time, ok so why was i eating japanese in chinammm the chinese was closed i am very happy though as it was superb food and amazing service the menu as a bit big  i thought i had finished and another two courses came outanyway  if you like japanese go here, if you have been to the excellent nadaman restaurant in shangrila hong kong dont think you will live the same experience here

the place is sad empty the food very average and this have no idea what teppanyaki is to top it all it is really expensive 2000rmb for 2 adults and one child

too bad i was really looking forward to a great teppanyaki i wish shangrila would be more consistent there operations in china are quite disappointing, friendly staff ordered a set menu at rmb300 wahgyu beef rice sashimi cawanmushi cold dish nice and worth it
told masakunisan that i dont eat raw and he suggested teppanyaki it appreciate the gesture
restaurant was crowded but the staff are well trained and friendly kudos to masakuni hiraisan well done , the food quality is out of expectation we didnt expect the quality in shanghai for japanese food the service is good and the price is relatively reasonable in a luxury hotel, it was my 8 year olds birthday and why not he wanted the teppanyaki the complete course meal was excellent they treated my kids very nice i am not giving them 5 stars because they had a very small table for teppanyaki and i can imagine that when crowded it would be very difficult to get it the portions are small but they are well accompanied by miso soup salad fried rice etc we even loved the waitress dresses the food was delicious, last night i went to nadaman with my boyfriend and i ordered amiyaki rice set it has wagyu beef inside
we didnt need to wait so long to get the food done  after i ate a bite of that wagyu beef it was really fantastic it was the most delicious wagyu beef that i have ever had
and sashimi was really fresh 
i also like the atmosphere in nadaman its really peaceful especially if you want to get romantic night with your boyfriend
the dessert also was really amazing

we also signed up for shangrewards membership it is free membership and shenny gave us passport indugence which we can use on our next visit to restaurant the crazy thing is we can get either discounts or complimentary things in every restaurant
shenny has a really good smile and she knows what customer want and need

i indeed will go there again good service and food

, excellent sushi good for an impressive business lunch good service highquality fish quiet and peaceful place, one of best japanese restaurant in shanghai the ambient is very nice with minimal japanese style the service is excellent
sushisashimi and tempura really good price medium high, this is very classy place located in old tower of sangrila face to luijiazui road with full glass front viewsame building with jade 36the menu is not that extensive nevertheless the sushi and wagyu beef quality is very goodservice is nice but servers could be more informativeprices are sangrila prices so if you are looking for cheap sushi better go carrefour first floors or some shopping malls food courtthis place is on another leaguea place that you could without any hesitation could hold a business dinner, i really enjoyed this place we took sushi sashimi and tepanyaki wagyu beef and everything was perfect service was also perfect i particularly enjoyed the draft kirin beer served with a frozen top see picture i strongly recommend this place if you wish to smoke you can go to the 36th floor bar and order sushi from there, as expected from the shangrila house this is an excellent place to eat your sashimi and other japanese dishes the selection is relatively standard not adventurous and the quality is consistently good it has a nice japanese flair it is popular during the week days lunch need reservations although on the high priced side but then again who would expect anything cheap here staff is relatively nice and very professional can clearly recommend this place if go with the right expectations, food was good at least for me standard but price was really expensive
at least for me near there are other places were you can eat a great sushi at a more reasonable price
hope my experience helps
have a nice day, good sushi but not wow there are better options with even better quality and much cheaper this is very expensive attention is very good, had dinner with some friends here while the restaurant is quite busy service is fast unobtrusive and very polite the food is excellent and the fish dishes are fresh and tastefully presented the manager and staff were very helpful and service was fast without beingin your office the sashimi and unagi were excellent though the udon was average the wine and beverage menu was also good good choice for japanese food while in shanghai, after checking in at shangrila i decided to have dinner at the sushi by nadaman the choice was not much that night as i went in at the restaurant at 9pm however whatever choice i made i was really satisfied the unagi was generous with the unagi itself i highly recommend if are a sushi lover, this was our first time to this restaurant and definitely one of our more memorable hotel dining experiences the food and service were excellent during the meal we were approached by the italian manager francesco was delightful heartwarming and pleasant not only did he anticipate our needs and offer recommendations it was all done with a smile as if nothing was too much trouble we were not by any means the only customers in the restaurant and francesco seemed delighted to assist where necessary and to mingle and welcome everyone happily
if there were more francescos in hotel restaurants the usual lack lustre hotel dining experience would not exist, ate lunch here while spending the day in shanghai had only about 45 minutes but thought i would take a chance since sushi is usually fast i ordered the lunch sushi special and it was great included thee large sushi cones and noodle and salad and ice cream too much but all was great nice presentation as well, visited this hotel in january 2015

loved ambiance at nada man japanese restaurant

we have been assisted directly by the operation manager mrhirai and it was really welcoming detailed and comfortable
this is what i expect has top service make me comfortable predict my needs and enjoy my stay

on side the interior design despite being almost 10 years old is still supercool

amazing, nice ambient very good food good service not cheap but worth the cost convenient if you are staying in the shangri la, pudong shangrila has two japanese restaurants one called sushi by nadaman on the groundlobby floor and the more authentic as i see it and the one i like nadaman on level 2 both in the grand tower of the hotel
today i had lunch with a colleague at nadaman which serves a number of lunch sets ranging from about rmb100 to rmb 600 each i had bbq eel set while my colleague had grilled cod marinated in bean paste set costing in total less than rmb400 my set comprised boiled spinach in light soy steamed egg with tuna sashimi hamachi tuna and salmon bbq eel with rice miso soup and pickles all were beautifully presented and excellent to the taste buds
understandingly the restaurant was full
the restaurant is billed as accommodating also smokers possibly in its private rooms
reservation is recommended, i was staying at the sjangri la in shanghai the japanese restaurant nadaman is in the sjangri la hotel building i had lunch there with a collegue was a great japanese lunch restaurant is classis japanese all japanese staff very good service and great classic japanese food i recommend a meal at this restaurant, if only they could speak english it would have been a great experience sushi was very fresh and of great variety but the language was a big problem, while i was in shanghai for a couple of months i kept going back to nadaman because they always served up mindblowingly good sushi

sit at the counter and have a chat with the chef  hell recommend you the freshest fish brought in that day and how we should order it  sashimi or maybe seared highlights for me would be the aburi toro tamago seared wagyu sushi scallops  both seared and fresh writing this now makes me wish i could go back there right now, very nice japanese in shanghai fresh sushi and seafood great chef and decent service in the middle of pudong at the shangrila hotel
a great location as it is across the road from the ifc building so great shopping and business mix
highly recommended if in the area, we have been to nadaman since we arrived in shanghai 4 years ago and we have been considering this japanese restaurant as the best in shanghai for its great food and elegant service we always have the feeling of having a great time in a refined atmosphere

we have then been disappointed recently by the service  no tablecloth on the table long waiting for the waiters to stop their chat and take our orders bring our food  finally we stood up and went to get someone to bring us desserts and the bill  poor service waiters speaking together loudly not friendly waiter diseapparing in the next door restaurant poor english no manager around too much trainees 

we will not come back until they improve, stopped by for sushi at lunch in april 2013 and was able to get seated without a reservation and enjoyed some great sushi with excellent service as well i would definitely dine here again and the location is very convenient for business in the pudong area of shanghai, nadaman at the shangrila hotel was recommended to us by another coworker who was recently in shanghai it was some of the best sushi ive had and the service is great i highly recommend the blue fin tuna blue fin tuna belly and wagyu beef individual pieces the rolls are amazing as well and the sake is on point, during a business trip in shanghai  last week and since i am not a fan of chinese food but rather a sushi  i was invited for business diner into nadaman in sangri la hotel in shanghai
truly one of the most delicious sushi places i have visited with a very friendly service and also reasonable prices, nadaman has some of the best sushi in shanghai and it is very well designed japanese earthy minimalism if you have a lot of money it is worthwhile to visit and eat at nadaman if the prices were half i would give it a 5stars rating and i would splurge and eat there often, the friendly service and fantastic menu the shrimp tempura hand rolls are exquisite the sashimi and sushi are excellent especially the salmon sashimi the tempura is light and crispy  we always order more, went to the sushi by nadaman twice during my recent trip to shanghai the sushi is very fresh and delicious the sushi chef and the servers provide very attentive services the sushi plcae though small it has very cosy ambience, first time to be in nadaman pudong we ordered

marinated beef set dinner sashimi appetiser was ok but main dish beef meat was very dry and not juicy at all ice cream dessert looked so cheap and low quality

beef teppanyaki set dinner beef was so chewy and cold i have not tasted the rest from this set so cannot evaluate other than main dish

we paid about 1400 rmb including some drinks but this place is not worth the money in terms of food quality taste and the value there will be no second visit","Taiwanese cuisine",0.99975676417818
217,"i was an expat in shanghai from 2003 to 2008 during this period t8 was for my wife and me the best restaurant in town  recently i was in shanghai for a business trip and i wanted to treat my colleague with a very special dinner i reserved a table at the t8 and i was astonished to get a table the same night unfortunately i had to find out when standing in front of the old location that the t8 is not in xintiandi anymore i dont understand that this was not mentioned during the reservation with some luck i found the new location the food and service was just ok for any other restaurant i would have rated it with 3 stars but compared to what t8 was 9 years ago its not something special anymore its a pity, <u+3010>sunday t8 brunch<u+3011>we were a group of 7 friends sitting outdoor at the balcony enjoying the brunch with dj beats food was awesome ambiance excellent and the dj music made the experience even greater
on the food side what to say all the dishes were great ingredients nicely selected and presentation sublime adding the free flow of prosecco for only 148rmb more
the new location in hubin dao showcases a great view over the park interior showcases a beautiful design with classic chinese furniture on wooden colors and stone shikumen feeling even exhibiting chinese pottery pieces
definitely a must go for enjoying great food and vibes anytime, one of the best restaurants not only in french concession district but in hole town
the food is awesome and steaks especially
they have a wide range of decent wine

the pricing is high a bitespecially to compare with other restaurantbut it worth itand you wont find such a food anywhere in shanghai, i went there for dinner and i have to say that i had one of the best meal in shanghai the service was excellent and the food very tasty and european, best meal we have had on this trip or any trip to shanghai the service was perfect and prompt the wine selection was good and the atmosphere was really nice best of all was the food and being able to watch it being prepared in a very nice section of towndont miss, we wanted a special meal to celebrate with family
the restaurant is dark trendy and comfortable the food ranges from good quality burgers to salmon and lamb shanks all with a twist we all liked the food we ordered the portions were small and i left feeling i could have eaten more overall we had a great meal but the price of the drinks soft and alcoholic is astoundingly expensive and you feel like they are ripping you off
so had a great time but it was very e pensive for 4 people and a child the food is priced well the drinks cost double the food slightly pretentious which is a shame, this is one of the more expencive restaurants in the area and although the food is resonably good it is not one of my favourites but i do like some of the more quirky options on the menu just to keep thing different the cocktails are good and the service is also good being just in the back street dose make for a nice quiet setting the over all dinning experience is good, i have eaten here once and the food was very good although expensive for the quality i have heard from friends that it can be a little inconsistent i would try it if you are here for a long time it may be really good but it may not be so if you are only for a few days or it is at the top of your budget i would give it a miss, given the reviews wed read here and elsewhere we expected a top shelf dining experience the restaurant setting welcome of the staff and ambience after being seated did nothing to diminish our high expectations then came the food  in short it was one of those meals where the entrees starters for our american friends delivered and the mains just kinda didnt
the mushroom soup was one of the best weve had and the tuna tataki was great too the mains both house specialties recommended by our waiter were good but not at the level youd expect for the prices the suckling pig and paella not described as such on the menu were ok but failed to excite service continued to be good and theyve a nice wine list
im not saying dont go just dont expect this to be the wow shanghai dining experience, we have 4 people and spend more around usd 300++ for the diner meal only orders 4 beers 1 honey lemon hot and 3 soups and 1 salad and 2 main courses portial is small  and too over price, had dinner here just yesterday  we ordered the squids for appetizer and steak for mains food was great although i find some dishes a little salty the staff were friendly and most of them speak good english they were able to explain what the dishes were made from

the atmosphere was good  only thing is that as it is enclosed you could hear the other tables conversing and it may tend to get a little noisy

dinner costed us around 1400rmb for two persons which is quite pricey but overall we enjoyed the experience and would return again, dashed into this restaurant right before a lightening storm and felt like the luckiest couple in shanghai great meal friendly service they went above and beyond by getting us a taxi after lunch not easy in a storm and walking us out to the street to make sure we were safely picked up thanks t8, pricy but worth it all dishes were so carefully and beautifully plate and so full of flavors and the staff alert but not too pushy a dinner to remember, my wife and i dined here on the last night of our visit to shanghai in early may at the suggestion of the concierge at the peninsula hotel i dont know if it helped that we came from there but gm alex siew and chef jordy treated us extremely well for example when we arrived our table wasnt quite ready yet but having to wait for 510 minutes at the bar was made much easier by the complementary champagne perrier jouet i think that we were served both the chef and gm visited our table more then once during our meal to check in and just to talk a bit all of that was very nice but the real surprise was the food which was outstanding and creative from beginning to end its a bit pricey but well worth it if you are looking for an upbeat upmarket dinner out in ultra hip xiantandi we will gladly return when we next visit shanghai, two words love it nice place nice food great service simply amazing interestingly the set up is so modern i forgot i was actually in shanghai, our touring group had a farewell dinner here and food and
premises were excellentno set menu and yet all orders were satisfied perfectlynice table in separated room, lovely restsurant in the french concession it was nice to shy away from shaihanese food after a lengthy visit very modern food with a quiet atmosphere very enjoyable drinks were quite pricey, a good fusion restaurant the food was delicious in brunch very family style touch and the kids could enjoy themselves perhaps the common issue in xintiandi the wait staffs have a sharp eye dont like to smile unless you tip them but all in all a nice place to go on sunday afternoon, lonely planet says its a hip and good restaurant
yes indeed
the restaurant with open kitchen also serves 2 to 4 courses brunch menu with lots of selection you can make

servers are excellent and food is good too, we had been there for team dinner with group of 14 persons the place looks very elegant with rustic decors and fine crafted furniture and dim lighting every dish we had was prepared with some specialty or at least looked great the taste buds loves the great looking food the service was quick and effective, weve lunched and dined at t8 a couple times over the years and our last visit was just after the ny in 2015 its a good address in an otherwise very touristic xintiandi with the same plump chef nice open kitchen but not very smiley staff my favourite dish was the grade 9 wagyu beef i ate a few years ago near valentines day i think but everything else we have tried since had been pretty good consistently simple creative wellexecuted dishes though on one occasion i think they forgot to serve the vongole in my pasta with vongole the dishes were usually nicely presented and their lunch menus when they do have them are pretty good value service was touch and go and if you are not there for an intimate meal i would recommend sitting on the open kitchen, visited several times and always enjoyed this restaurant in the middle of xintiandi love the area and the interior of the restaurant  with the open kitchen on view higher priced than the surrounding restaurants but worth it ive eaten at several other places close but i prefer t8, ive visited many times and enjoyed my experience to go back i just think that for this type and style of food there are better places for value in overall dining experience

food does get a seasonal flair and execution is strong wait staff has improved over the years and also attentive we needed to be in and out in 60 mins and they were on the spot

location is such that the bar smoke does permeate through the window seating areas if you are sensitive please be ware

also its a nice open kitchen with kitchen area sitting

always i leave this place wondering how much i spent and not recalling what i ate that really brings me back perhaps thats a reflection point to ponder a bit more

give it a try if you are in area and see for yourself, great food and service friendly but if quiet you struggle to get attention
however if in the area it serves very good food in pleasant setting i would return, we had the entire 2nd floor for 80 people for dinner  it worked out great the seating was casual comfortable very cool unique space to do an event the good was really good too, we spent a cosy and memorable evening here recently this place epitomises the great culinary things that are occurring in shanghai the selection of imaginative dishes done by the italian chef made it hard to fault well worth looking out for and trying, i attended a dinner for about 80 people the restaurant accommodated us on the second level with a buffet and casual seating groups the food was only soso but the space worked very well for this function, we attended a dinner here and thoroughly enjoyed the experience great service and a great selection of food types all of a high standard of this international restaurant, beautiful decor with an open kitchen this high end western restaurant caters to rich foreigners and business dinners expect small portions of well done and creatively prepared cuisine that looks almost too good to eat, visited on a thursday evening and got lucky without a reservation recommended the atmosphere is quite nice seating a bit unusual round tabel with one third round benches service was very attentive and quick special requests taken without issues ie cocktails had squid and crusted tuna as starters followed by the tbone and the wagyu steak nicely done very tasty the special was the desert kind of a tasting platter with lots of very small items made of unusual flavors in cream jelly sorbet and icecream anytime again great evening, had a fantastic meal at t8 the special hairy crab avocado roll appetizer was excellent as well as the beef tataki chilean sea bass prepared 4 ways was absolutely delicious service was excellent very attentive without being overbearing love the open kitchen concept beautiful decor  expensive but glad we had the opportunity to try it , i visited t8 at xintiandi for dinner on a monday table for one i walked in no reservation and got a table immediatly the place is just beautiful the open kitchen is lovely you can sit at the bar and watch your food being prepared i ordered the tomato soup and the suckling pig which were very good for dessert i had the dulce de leche icecream which was perfect i see many reviews complaining about the portion sizes this is author cuisine we are talking about here you have to live the whole experience from the ambiance to the decoration and the service as well there are certainly many good places to eat for a budget in shanghai where large portions are the rule this is not the place for that for 500 rmb a person dinner at t8 does not come cheap but that does not mean you wont get value from your money consider for a special celebration would definitely visit again, we have dined at t8 multiple times it is a beautiful place the bar dining room and open kitchen are lovely service is always solid unfortunately we have not found the food to standout and it is pricey, we had not been here for a few months and were surprised that the old comfortable couches had gone instead there were more dining tables  guess that is good for the restaurant as more seating means more paying customers service was again excellent  discreet yet efficient

the french blue mussels in cold cream soup looked good and tasted good as well for the mains i had the seafood casserole which was delicious even my wife wanted to have some of it the prawns were of a nice size and firm however the razor clams did have a bit of sand in them
my wife had the beef tenderloin she said it was quite nice but the two pieces were rather small

for dessert she selected the deconstructed tiramisu which was a nice surprise in terms of taste while my raspberry sorbet with hibiscus infusion was refreshing without being too sweet

it was a pleasant lunch and we certainly look forward to the next meal here for those who prefer to watch the chefs at work in the show kitchen you can request a seat there, decided to try t8 last week when i was visiting shanghai i go there for work and have dined at dozens of restaurants there there are many better options than t8

when we sat down we ordered some wine and were pushed quite hard to select our choice of starter and main almost immediately after making our selections bread and the amuse were rushed to the table we didnt even have napkins yet not sure why these arent part of the setting before we even got half way through the amuse the starters were served quite annoying especially considering this is not the least expensive western restaurant

food was good but not great service needs major improvements suggest you spend the same money elsewhere for a much nicer experience, we had fois gras and squid starters lamb and fish mains food was prepared and presented well surroundings were just ordinary tables a little cramped and closeness meant little intimacy especially with loud neighbouring table so overpriced western food which can be found pretty much anywhere in shanghai in better appointed restaurants especially along the bund

the waiting staff tried to remove my plate 3 times whilst i was still eating

a major bugbear was on paying with my visa i was charged in sterling even though i had ticked the rmb box  allowing them to set exchange rate and exchange costs i remonstrated and was told this was the only way their machines worked patently not true so if you go best take earmuffs cash and rosetinted glasses i have lived in shanghai 8 years and urge you to go elsewhere, love the open kitchen able to watch the chefs working tasty western food appropriate portion small place but really good dining experience in the evening situated in xintiandi with lots of other fb and interesting shops around, this was my second visit to t8 and both were very positive experiences the atmosphere and service were impeccable and the food was creative and wellexecuted thank you for a very memorable experience, i had the chance to visit this hidden but iconic spot a few times now every time the experience was flawless this restaurant is opened for many years already which is already an impressive fact given the fast changing dining scene in shanghai the current chef is giving his own south european touch to the menu the creations are playful and the servers explain well the combinations and how to combine them the wine list is extensive all classics are listed with few highlights like austrian wine for instance
the damage is okay considering the whole experience but is definetly one of the pricier restaurants in the already pricy dining scene of shanghai definetly worth a visit, if you have the opportunity to have a dinner in t8 you must order <u+00a8>the moon<u+00a8> and <u+00a8>thesea<u+00a8>
beautiful  surprise  and tasty , i have been here twice and this place is one of the best restaurant s i have ever trind expensive the price is high but not compared to the standards if i ever come back to shanghai this is a place i defenitly come back to, atmosphere was superb cosy quiet and upper class feel prices are high not meant for your weekly dinner occasional celebration is perfect, i found this restaurant rundommly in xianti area the prices on the menu were very expensive but they proposed a special lunch menu 185 yuan taxes included 2 starters 1 main 1 desert
it was great  very refined i sat in front of the kitchen everything was extremely clean and cooked on demand real pleasure everything was very good and the desert was amazing 
the services was perfect and very fast

i highly recommend this place, the atmosphere is lovely modern and sparkling we sat at the kitchen counter to watch the chefs and it was fun our first bottle of wine was not good but was tasted and replaced with no trouble at all well done my food was very good not outstanding but very good unfortunately my husbands t bone steak was not a good cut cooked fine but was unexpectedly stringy and sinewy disappointing service was okay overall a nice meal but not as expected for the price and reviews, this is the perfect place for a smooth nice dinner and drinks
been there several times and never been disappointed
the only thing last time i was there with my partner we had to call the attention of the chef as he was wearing this long hair without a band or a hat and moving quite strongly over the food
i was worry to get some hair on my food and it wasnt pleasant to see
this place is so elegant and the chef should be more put together, we tried this place on the off chance it looked a bit different and caught our eye as we walked past the first thing we noted was how popular the place seemed

first off we were given a strange cheesy biscuit melon shot to start with which was a bit weird but not half as weird as the melon balls which accompanied my sucking pig dish i didnt like the combination at all it wasnt something i would never have again the pork that was delicious but the melon just didnt go well with it id have been far happier if the chef has stuck to tradition and done his take on a tried and tested apple accompaniment

my wife had the linguine and she thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it loved it in fact she said it was the best shed ever tried which is a huge compliment coming from my wife she doesnt say things like that unless she really means it

its well worth a visit watch out for the melon though, i was surprised how good this was the same quality you would expect in any western city its asian influenced spanish service was outstanding, we dropped in early on a saturday evening 7ish  sat at the bar and had a couple of great martinis at 730 we asked if it was possible to get a booking for 2 for dinner at around 9 restaurant manager said yes  so hubbie stayed at bar and i raced out for a meeting and got back at 9 told our table was nearly ready by 915 no table  which is ok but no one bothered to communicate to us  by 930 we asked if our table was available  we were offered a table in the bar  we declined as the bar is a smoking bar  940 still no table and no one from restaurant bothering to communicate so asked for bar bill  restaurant manager came with excuses  too little too late  definitely not high level service, i love this place have eaten here on several occasions and just love the food on the first first occasion the restaurant suffered power shortages but this still did not detract from the quality of food or service i have spoken to the chef who is very passionate abut his job and creating wonderful food will definitely return and return and return, visited t8 for a mothers day lunch last weekend it was our first visit and we had a great time
we loved the setting in xintiandi and the decor was impressive the bar to overlook the kitchen looked fun we had a normal table with a little teddy bear to join us
service was superb throughout and all the food was cooked and served to our liking
we each had a different egg based appetizer of which the scrambled eggs was the favorite of our table there was nothing wrong with the florentine egg or the hot egg plate with chips
for the main course we had the seafood linguine the burger and the strip loin all excellent and well received
desserts were quirky and very tasty and my daughter loved the berries with white chocolate sauce
we also indulged in the free flow champagne to celebrate the day and it flowed well assisted by the attentive staff
the lunch was great fun and a made for a memorable mothers day
we would recommend t8 for the sunday brunch and look forward to returning for dinner one evening","Healthy",0.984489664705787
218,"came here twice whilst visiting family in sahnghai both times the food was great and the service even better we had breakfast which was great as we craved something british and we also had the burger which was very nice the owner was very welcoming and made us feel very at home i would really recommend this place, went to mr harry for dinner last night good food good service and friendly atmosphere had the cod which was fresh and tasty however i thought the portion could have been slightly bigger my wife had the steak which was slightly under seasoned but very tasty apple and pear crumble for dessert was top class definitely worth a go, an absolutely fantastic and authentic experience at mr harry last week a real gem for shanghais buzzing and vibrant restaurant scene i went to mr harry with high expectations based on the pervious reviews and i was not disappointed the food was delicious and the service was first class i especially recommend the scotch eggs my favourite and the fish and triple cooked chips which was to die for

a real delight and a home away from home for me on my next trip im looking forward to trying their afternoon tea which ive heard is fantastic would definitely recommend, every now and then i go to mr harrys usually for breakfast on a saturday morning his full english is great good size portion and some of the best english sausages you will find in town exactly what at least i am looking for after a late friday night what disappoints sometimes is the food coming to the table not really hot dont be put off by the location it lacks the romance from the outside but inside it is nice, decent british fare and good service there is a friendly atmosphere especially lunchtime until afternoon tea a decent choice of weekday lunchtime specials are on offer accompanying the main menu, i would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out the finest british cuisine and beer in china or simply is longing for a bit of a british atmosphere in the centre of shanghai very friendly staff and owner

definitely coming back, i visited there with my friends for a casual sunday lunch
very pleased with the menu service and food
intend to try to go there on a regular basis when i get cravings for british food
the portions were reasonable as were the prices, friendly service and good english food and drinks the best fish and chips i have had in shanghai although the pea puree that comes with it is a bit weird and nothing like mushy peas good sunday roasts as well, simply the best apple crumble ive had in years and a proper british portion definitely going back for more, excellent food and a relaxed atmosphere the owner harry is very friendly and knowledgeable about the area worth a visit, absolutely delicious better than my mums home cooked breakfast i thoroughly recommend people visit for breakfast lunch or dinner when in shanghai, christmas 2015 was our 2nd visit to mr harry the first time was soso decent food but overall a mediocre experience as for the christmas dinner it was very poor and to cut a long story short there wont be a 3rd visit

to start the day off they didnt have a table for us  despite us making a booking several weeks earlier it was christmas so it wasnt a big problem for us and we got a little table in the end the food was very small portions not an authentic christmas dinner and not worth the money the main course came in the form of a sharing platter  perhaps 5 small pieces of turkey between us

not to mention too many people  not enough tables they had to keep rearranging the tables and we got moved around two or three times during our dinner

overall the restaurant is an absolute shambles you can get better food better service and a better experience elsewhere  for half the price, just returned from a 10 day package beijing xian shanghai trip to china we are a family of four including two college age kids we were out for a day shopping and site seeing on nanjing road tired of chinese food and looking for some western comfort food we did a big mac meal for lunch and stumbled upon mr harry where we had dinner the host was very helpful and friendly offering some travelers advice the burger topped with pulled pork and the traditional uk fish and chips hit the spot also newcastle ale was a welcome change to the lightweight beers typically served in china
give mr harry a try, me and my friends went for xmas dinner heard good things about the place menu looked very enticing we waited outside the restaurant 45 mins past our allotted starting dining time we didnt complain about that because it was christmas in fairness its obviously going to be jammers being a british restaurant the english staff were helpful the other staff were pretty useless
the portion sizes were measly to say the least and on christmas day away from home we were all looking forward to being stuffed but that didnt happen the picture of the platter was the main course portion for 4 people im a guy i shared with three girls who wouldnt eat too much in comparison to me and we were all left hungry at the end we actually went straight to the shop to buy oven pizzas and cooked them when we got home the food itself was nice but the fact that the portions were terrible ruined it we had one brussel sprout between 4 people there was no stuffing the ham had bones and cartilage and we got enough gravy for one person we received no egg nog as was advertised on the flyers there was no butternut squash parsnips or sweet potatoes which make up for 75 of the roast vegetables also i dont believe that the carrots were honey roasted or however they phrased it because they came out mixed in with the potatoes and they all tasted like they were all cooked together
half the chocolate deserts were totally frozen the other half soft there was no raspberry coulis
overall huge disappointment if i could rewind time i would pay another restaurant multiples of what i paid at mr harry for xmas dinner, i came with my boyfriend after being here for almost 3 months and couldnt face any more rice or noodles
it was really good food we got the sharing platter to start all really good especially the sausage rolls the chicken wing sauce was a bit too spicy for our taste we would have preferred a bbq instead
that was completely forgotten about when our mains arrived i ordered the fish and chips  really tasty and crispy and my boyfriend got the english breakfast which he also said was delicious
harry made an effort to come and have a chat with us too which we appreciated hes a really nice guy
i went back for a sunday beef roast dinner after my boyfriend had left and it was exactly what i wanted perfectly cooked meat too  an acoustic duet were singing christmas songs too so a lovely atmosphere all around i would definitely recommend it to come here if youre british and missing home or just interested in british culturefood, im going to try and give a bit of a comprehensive review about mr harrys as i love a good full english and i found other peoples reviews crucial in helping me decide where to go ive tried to be as unbiased as possible and simply rate it on what i saw and was given im also trying to review it vs a uk based english breakfast despite it being a rarity where you may make unreasonable allowances for slippage in quality simply because it is on par if not better

so after a few weeks of only chinese food the prospect of going for a full english breakfast was one i had been taking seriously pondering over maps for best location to fit into the rest of my schedule including distance from metro points reading the reviews to get a real feel for what i was committing time money and energy to

ill start off with finding the place thanks to another reviewer who outlined marks and spencer the task of finding the place became a little easier if youre walking from east nanjing side keep an eye out for marks and spencer then look for a shop called american eagle next to it youll see the entrance to a multiplex type place youll spot the union jack sign on the signboard which is where you need to head towards the location is a little before the metro station entrance from e nanjing side

on going up to the 5th floor i was immediately greeted with a friendly smile and a wave from one of the waitresses who led me over to a table by the window as i walked through i saw a number of expats and on the table behind me were a group of local chinese ladies who seemingly were having a regular meeting at their table with pots of tea dotted about i was glad to have free wifi which kept me occupied whilst waiting for my order which did not take long to come at all

i received a menu and ordered a full english and a pot of tea

on my full english i had 2 rashers of bacon 1 good sized sausage a ladle of beans approximately 10 small mushrooms a piece of what looked like deep fried black pudding a tomato 1 piece of toast 2 runny eggs and a huge pot of tea

the bacon was well cooked nicely done not over crisp nor tepid or moist like ive had in some places where they clearly boil the bacon  yeah my thoughts exactly

the sausage seemed like a homemade sausage which for my own personal preferences was a little under done but i always err on the side of caution with meat and especially when travelling given the body is under enough stress and change but it was certainly very tasty indeed

there could have been more in the way of beans but the portion size was perfectly adequate and i usually find too large a portion of beans only serves to drown the toast in bean juice leaving me with limp excuse for toast so on the whole no complaints there either wow this is going really well so far

the two eggs were perfectly cooked  they didnt seem fried as there werent any crispy bits to the underside it was almost as if they had been poached but on a flat surface these were absolutely scrumptious  very nice indeed

the toast were well toasted not slightly breathed on like they usually tend to be could have used a smidgen more butter but it was enough on the whole it was one piece cut into two i think two may have been a bit nicer but again 1 toast was perfectly adequate with two serving only to make the overall meal heavier after all i wasnt about to build a loft conversion or raise a side extension after breakfast merely potter around shanghai so it was probably about right

the mushrooms and tomatoes were perfectly cooked and gave just the right offset against the rest of the meal as i dont eat black pudding i cannot review but it did look tempting

all in all the meal was a good balance between portion size yet filling not at all greasy but it did feel like a proper breakfast that had me full of energy all day it felt like a proper full english done in the right way

now when it comes to the tea i was ecstatic that i finally had a proper brew though i may be slightly biased because i have struggled to get a brew exactly the way i wanted it  milky and immediately drinking temperature usually made using 23rds tea to 13rd cold milk  its hard enough to get this to order in the uk with two weeks of just having ridiculously strong tea in starbucks or being given creamer or uht giving my tea that aftertaste you tend to get

i know i could quite easily have gone to a supermarket and bought tea bags and milk and made a brew which i did whilst moving from hotel to hotel during my stay across multiple cities in china but it was just nice to get a proper cuppa with a meal without having to make a specific trip for it

however given that i do prefer a milkier tea and there was a reason i explained all of that i was given what was essentially a shot glass full of milk  it was enough for one cup to give me a slightly stronger tea than the 23rd13rd ratio and i fully appreciate i probably come across quite fussy  im not im just describing my method so when i asked for more i was given a second shot glass whereas a small pot or glass of milk might have suited better however i do appreciate that im probably in a minority and that the smaller amount of milk probably works for the majority  i just personally didnt think it was enough for the huge pot of tea i was given the one shot glass would have made for a very very strong tea

the pricing is higher than you would pay for a full english in a local builders cafe in the uk 98 yuan but it was well worth it and of course it is higher and quite rightly it is higher youre in shanghai not dalston the same way we pay higher prices for exported chinese specialities back home the reverse is rightly true here no complaints there either

the quality was akin to what youd get in an upmarket brunch type place maybe a sams or equivalent in the uk so therefore certainly in the same price bracket and incredibly good value personally

the venue itself looks lovely not aged at all unlike some other reviewer has remarked  perhaps it has been revamped in the time that lapsed since that review its got a fresh homely feel without feeling cramped or up its own backside you dont feel rushed youre able to take your time the service is available without being overbearing

the owner himself went round to each table ensuring everyone was well looked after and was willing to engage in some small talk seemed like a thoroughly nice guy with a real care and attention for detail for each of his customers im sure if there are any complaints he takes them very personally and some of the comments in other reviews have certainly been rectified as i did not get a whiff of any issues

the things i would like to see are slightly more milk served with the vast tea pot  lets say the pot which held the tea sieve full of milk would have been adequate
next make this place easier to find maybe with pics on the website of exactly what to look for the map is there though so i suppose using a bit of nouse should be able to find it finally add omlettes to your menu which are only marginally more difficult but may also work well with the local market too as given the choice i may have gone for an omlette with toast instead

all in all this was a 910 experience only marred by the milk issue  to which i say wow what a world we live in where one solitary man can be slightly annoyed at having slightly less milk for his tea than would have been ideal

dont worry  this place is a gem go and check it out and you wont be disappointed, i went to mr harrys last month specially to have the full english breakfast because it is advertised with black pudding to be honest most of the items on the plate were ok but since i went to find that rarity in china black pudding i was extremely disappointed it had no flavour no shape no texture no colour just a lifeless glob of tripe i am seldom moved to be really upset about my food because i like most things and can accommodate the various issues and influences in china sorry to say i will not be too keen to return mr harry must try harder, currently sat in mr harrys just me lady by herself
just ate the fish and chips and dont know where the negative comments come from the fish was gorgeous light and fluffy the chips were thick cut old school style chips i opted for the small portions
also having a chinese beer my preference and the glass is more than full however i had had a couple of slurps before i took my pic
met allen manager he welcomed me had a little chat and i was presented with a loyalty card
fabulous experience situated in between american eagle and gap very easy to find a welcome distraction from the market and only about 5 mins walk from it
will definitely visit again, the service is amazing harry is very friendly we had a good chat with him the atmosphere is very british the food is very good very authentic also has a vegetarian option the peanuts with the fried salted red peppers were to die for yummy, delicious comfort food served here the steak with the eggs benedict is delicious
got a full english here too and it felt like home

great place, like other reviewers i too had high expectations of mr harry also being an officianado of the full english i was looking forward to tucking into a hearty breakfast after four weeks of dumplings in the morning
my hopes were somewhat dashed the eggs were barely cooked not just the yolks but the whites the toast was paper thin and the butter pat was no exaggeration about 1cm x 1cm in size not enough to spread on the single piece of toast the sausage was very fatty and needed a few more minutes in the pan
the bacon was fine and the mushrooms very nice however the overall experience was spoiled by the sound of the cook making the disgusting hoiking sound in the kitchen while he was making my breakfast
the service is pleasant and the decor is charming however this is a breakfast that needs work, i come to shanghai all the time and this place was a great find great food amazing drinks and the service was amazing you must eat the eggs benedict with steak the bloody mary was perfect i will be back a lot great place for a hang over, date of visit july 17 2015

after reading the rave reviews my expectations were high on my first visit to mr harry unfortunately i was disappointed for several reasons where i come from in britain the batter is a light golden colour and can be cut easily with a fork at mr harrys the batter is dark brown or even black in places and very crispey the batter breaks when you try to cut it i am used to chips not potato wedges the fat is either to hot or the fish is cooked way to long

second i asked for a pint of beer i received the pint glass but it was only 34 full because they only have bottled beer i didnt see any beer on tap

i know beijing is an expensive place to live but 118 yuan for the large fish and chips i feel c$23 is excessive

i was hoping to write a positive review but cannot so for me the best fish and chips in china is still hong kong, my family and i love this place we go here often and have never had a bad meal the owner is attentive and will have conversation with customers very friendly a very good beer selection great fish and chips, three of us went for brunch at this restaurant  our chinese host found that on the wechat chinese search engine it is a small restaurant with a very non conspicuous entrance the restaurant entrance is next to the american eagle store  on the 5th floor of the building the interiors give you a reminder of british things and the layout is simple  still elegant the menu is very british and the service is good one young man with a typical british accent interacted with clients and even offered to play bridge with you if you had the time the egg preparations were very good and the dessert pear and apple with custard and crust was excellent it is indeed an authentic british restaurant worth having a meal, if youre in shanghai and missing a taste of home theres no better place to visit great home comforts on the food side along with good drinks and even high tea sunday roast a must washed down with a cool pint of cider to top it off harry is always around to offer local advice for any new traveller to the city i love asian food but when i want something different and missing home harrys is my number one stop, i have eaten at mr harry a few times but sunday i had my first breakfast when a restaurant says its british the breakfast is a good test this was outstanding english sausage bacon and blackpudding get the full english it is the best british breakfast i have had outside of britain
a treat for an ex pat brit
pot of tea was a nice bonus, mr harry is a great place for british food and great service harry is one of the best people you could meet in shanghai ive visited mr harry both times i have been in shanghai fantastic fish and chips with home made tartar sauce great specials too, been here a few times for lunch and dinner and always a reliable location tried the premium afternoon tea and it was glorious get selection of pastries and desserts with a couple of nice sandwiches also included a ice cream the freshly baked scones with cream and jam were fantastic

lots of options for afternoon tea in shanghai and this is on my top 10 list , i was recommended to this place by another brit and decided to try the fish and chips on the first visit very good
on the second occasion i attended their brit club event and heard lord wei talk about the recent election  an excellent talk by the way i enjoyed a couple of mugs of real tea and their free snacks provided for the event
the owner harry is a nice guy and interesting to talk to
i will be going back soon, ive eaten at mr harry for the last two years and because the proprietor has tried so hard to improve his restaurant that i feel he finally deserves a review for those in the past who had written less than a stellar review i recommend that they give mr harry another chance harry spencer has always welcome criticisms and is very accommodating to the customers demands he has consistently tried to improve his menu and i believe he has finally reached his goal his recent revised menu offers one of the best hamburgers in town no need to schlep all the way to the bund and pay for an expensive australian beef burger mr harrys hamburgers are thick meaty juicy and are at a very reasonable price if you order the hamburger in the special lunch menu you also get a glass of wine or choice if other beverage with the meal my husband loves his fish and chips and the rest of the dishes in his new menu look very enticing on a rainy day tired out from shopping at mark and spencer and dying for a cup of cappuccino but discover that the cafe is packed with families and children you should just go next door to mr harry it may not be the elegant tea parlor one imagines but it does offer comfort good coffee and a very good selection of english beer and if harry spencer is there you can be sure a good conversation will follow or you can just sit quietly by one of the long window view tables and just watch the busy nan jing xi lu scene below this place is not elegant or fancy by any mean but i recommend this restaurant for expats locals young and old who are on limited budget looking for a good meal good conversation a quiet place to dream about your future or to just think about what you want to do tomorrow, if you like british food this is the place to go in shanghai sunday breakfast and roast are great during the week the bangers and mash are very good with speciality sausages fish and chips also in addition they have a very good selection of british beers including a westwood ale on tap not sure where the bad reviews have come from but everytime i am there the staff is great and along with harry are very attentive, in possession of a free cream tea for two decided to visit with a friend and take along her mother but would pay for her first they didnt have our reservation the place was empty when we arrived we were told to sit anywhere and just left to it they told us there would be enough for 3 people and would bring another cup i asked if i could upgrade to afternoon tea and i would pay the difference but was told nowe all had to have the same tea even although there was a choice everyone had to have the same two of the cups were badly cracked the teapot spout had a chip out of it and one of the plates also had a big chip in it scones were not fresh jam poor the tea was so strong it must have been stewing for a long time sadly the place had a feeling of being neglected dirty marks on the walls paintings all askew and as you entered there was a table piled with all sorts of thing and a flag had been thrown over it to cover it up sadly felt we wasted our time making the trip wont be back even if i have a free voucher time wasted, poor i had read reviews and was quite encouraged to visit for a new year eve dinner with the family the place has the atmosphere of an oxford street tourist shop with surly young staff with one aim only to get everyone out by 2200 perhaps we chose a bad night, i am struggling to understand some of these almost perfect reviews on tripadvisor for this place unfortunately we found it very average and pricey for what it was

contrary to other reviews we walked past it twice before noticing the small plaque on the wall it is in a much larger building and 5 floors up we were seated immediately and the service was quick but there was no interaction with any of the staff and no attempt at any chat

we found the menu quite limited in choice and ordered the hamburgers which were very good and arrived quickly and perfectly cooked

at 220 for 2 burgers  a tea and a coke it was pricey compared to other places in shanghai and we wouldnt feel inclined to rush back or rave about it

found it very average and expected quite a bit more based on the reviews, harry is here there and everywhere to take care of you and make your meal or drinks as good as he can fish n chips excellent piece of large tasty fish half chicken with peri peri sauce excellent succulent chicken wings in a tasty sauce bangers n mash also house made and excellent uk beer list truly remarkable if you like 6x and ruddles with many more options including our local english ale from the westwood lads, i have been to mr harrys several times i love their fish and chips
this time i tried the hamburger it was the best hamburger i have had in shanghai im not lying
maybe one of the best i have had anywhere

im from canada and we love our burgers dont miss this one you will be coming back for more

keep up the good work harry, went to mr harrys not once but three times in the past week harry is a nice fella who obviously cares about his restaurant breakfast was the best meal of the three with what i would consider to be bacon and tasted great cod and chips was equally as good the roast chicken special had good chicken which we could carve a rare event in china and some great sides although there couldve been more roast potatoes my wife had the ploughmans which came with the largest slice of pork pie i have seen the desserts were good too my boy destroyed the ice cream i enjoyed the trifle and the apple crumble was good although slightly too heavy location is hard to find but if you use marks and spencers as your guide  it is near there on that side of the road opposite noz hair products well worth a visit for those wanting a taste of home, was very surprised by mr harry not just by the owner himself who was ever present and chatty giving his opinion on some of the great selection of british ale as well as just general small talk
we had the fish and chips and were not disappointed a huge portion of battered cod and chips great tasting homemade sauces definitely a place every expat should visit in shanghai, as is often the case with restaurants struggling to be something theyre not this place is no exception i had no idea what food was brought to the table something more like dressedup chinese food the portions were tiny and belong on a kfc childrens menu i felt totally embarrassed bringing my wife here to waste a lot of time as well as money on total crap
we endedup going to another place for a proper dinner and drinks so the evening wasnt a total loss, i was fully satisfied with their big breakfast the serving size was really huge and the food was fresh and tasty next day i came here for lunch and ordered fish and chips that was cooked to my liking again i couldnt save a room for dessert  hope i will try their cakes and pastries on my next visit to mr harry i heard their desserts tasted great, great environment lots of interesting british heritage in the way of furniture and random trinkets food wise its a welcome choice of british classic dishes done in a genuine homemade way that you just dont get anywhere else in shanghai easy to find on nanjing west rd 5th floor between gap and and american outfitters clothing stores
i have visited many times so proof that despite a couple of minor inconstancies it is a great british restaurant, great place food beer selection all excellent even serves haggis for those certain special occasions cheers harry, wow what a gem in shanghai could not fault any part of our meal pork pie and sausage rolls are great as was the sunday roast big portions had no room for dessert great service also perfect gem of a place in the heart of shanghai should be on everyones list to visit, we went on sunday evening and had bangors and mash and fish and chips bangors are made in house and some of the best ive had fish and chips are above average service is excellent they have nightly specials and ive been told the steak night is excellent i have not tried it but intend to, if you are like us we hated the chinese food and this was a little miraclewe tried to find it the first day but google maps has it in the wrong place so couldnt find it

the manager was great and gave us lots of good advice

a must visit if coming to shanghai, after searching for somewhere to eat that wasnt chineseor westernmcdonaldskfcetcwe decidedafter finding this place on trip advisorto give it a gowellwe were pleasantly surprisedhow do you find an english fishnchip shop in shanghaiamazingas soon as we walked in harrywe forgot to ask if that was his real namecame over and spoke to us and made us feel completely at homeif you get my meaningwe had a proper drinksomething unusual this far from homeand more importantlya lovely plate of fish and chipsif you wanted there was real apple pie and custardi kid you notall in all a real find in shanghaigive it a goim sure you wont be disappointed
ps by proper drinkshe has bottled real alesas well as g+t etc, we went to this restaurant for dinner upon entering we were promptly greeted in a helpful and friendly manner by a member of staff and passed to mr harry to escort to table although there were quite a number of people already in the restaurant it did not seem crowded and we were offered a choice of where to sit on the enclosed balcony overlooking nanjing road we ordered fish and chips and bangers and mash and made appropriate selection from the available british bottled ciders and beers the food arrived quickly enough both it and the drinks were good we felt cosy at our table despite the presence of so many other people in the restaurant and the service was efficient yet discreet when we finished eating we had a long chat with harry who we found to be interesting and straightforward we thoroughly enjoyed our evening and i wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant some directions that may help in locating the premises are take the metro to nanjing road west station and leave the station by exit 2 turning right at street level then walk a few paces to the entrance of number 819 which will be on your right lifts are on the right of the entrance hall go to the 5th floor where the restaurant is clearly marked best to avoid the escalators and they do not offer a direct route, i visited mr harrys as a party of 16 on arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and given a complimentary cocktail the staff were very attentive and efficient nothing was too much to ask the food came within good time and unusually for china  it arrived pretty much at the same time so we could all eat together the food was delicious in particularly the ploughmans the portions were a good size and the price was very reasonable i will definitely be visiting again, i am on my third trip to shanghai this year and wish i would have know about mr harry from trip one phenomenal drinks exceptional really food and presentation involved an friendly owner i visited with my wife and a friend two thumbs up from all of us dont skip this place","dumpling restaurant",0.999749539179875
219,"a little difficult to find  not sure if we would have found it if our friend hadnt been there before mid price range tapas but absolutely delicious the atmosphere was great and our group didnt feel pressured to leave even though the tables were turning over the staff were great would definitely return reasonably priced wine, had dinner here last week with an old friend and we both chose the chefs special definitely the right choice not super cheap but in an interesting part of town and worth the trip especially on a wednesday tapas, i have dined at tomatito several times and yet every time chef julio finds the way to surprise and spoiled us agnes is always polite and professional making you feeling home furthermore here there is a great value for money you must have a try, arrived single for dinner so they seated me at end of the bar then began piling dirty glasses and dishes in front of me i complained the filipina hostess kindly noticed and moved me she was the star of the evening no one else seemed to pay any attention to guests food was very tasty as were cocktails i left with mixed feelings
returned a few nights later thinking id double check my experience same situation only worse got seated at the bar then ignored for 1015 minutes even the bartender waved me away as she was too busy cleaning glasses and replacing a beer keg no one could bother to take my order so i walked out no one noticed that either
seems like a great place advice you take a group and then flail your arms to get service the food might make it worth it for you, i wasnt happy about going to a spanish restaurant while im in shanghai but i loved the food everything we ate was delicious even the chef came out to ask us about our meal the service was excellent and the decormusic was funky
one negative for me as i dont like going down stairs was the three flights of stairs you had to go up to get to the restaurant
portion sizes were on the smaller side but ordered lots of dishes and shared
highly recommend, we were there with 4 adults and 3 children on an evening

service was great  we were just ordering and the waitress remembered all the numerous plates we ordered by heart without taking any notes
tapas were delicious there were several local spanish people so that is a proof that the food is authentic and original
it is a super cosy and warm place too great decoration

the only minus is the smoking allowed at the bar once that goes away then they get a five star from me, it took more than one hour to receive the 4 different tapas that we asked the place it was not even crowed the taste was good but the first tapas arrived cold, nice and casual tapas restaurant
not easy to find  the only down point
located in a small nice square it has a wide choice of tapas all very good
you can have a casual as a romantic as a business dinner whatever youre in the mood of you are in the right place, tomatito is an amazing restaurant very friendly service and atmosphere and more importantly with a remarkable consistency let chef julio arranging your dinner you will like it
nevertheless very good value for money
bravo, we booked a table for 20 people to enjoy the sunday brunch unfortunately the service was absolutely slow food was deliver up to 2 hours late the most disappointing part was the filipino waitress who made our experience a very bad one from starting taking orders to delivering the food she showed not patience no tolerance and no service attitude as she didnt wait to take the food orders and was challenging us all the time finally to make everything worst some food options ordered were not available with the argument that several orders were placed and not enough food
i hope the management pays attention to these problems to prevent further deterioration of their image, the menu offers a wide range of tapas for each taste this is one of my favourite restaurangs in shanghai the location is very good in the town center, we went to tomatito for saturday brunch there were approximately 15 diners there at the time we had a very delicious four course brunch for 98 rmbperson there was free flow wine for +50 the food was a bit salty but there was a very good variety of flavors we were in a group of 3 and we each chose different dishes which meant we tried 12 different dishes service left a lot to be desired we were there for 25 hours for the full meal while we were not in a hurry it was still incredibly slow and there were a few mix ups with our orders, came here with family and friends we had a good selection of tapas from the menu and it was all delicious the dessert was even better nutella filled brioche would definitely visit again good sangria too, after 6 years living in asia finally i found a real tapas bar i cant recommend one tapas over others all of them were yummy

great food with fantastic atmosphere

definitive i will be back when i will be in shanghai, we heard about their wednesday night deal its advertised as tapas for 10rmb but of course isnt as great as it sounds

the deal is from 911 and there is only a choice of 6 or 7 tapas that are from 1015 rmb we actually had to really press the waiters about this deal its like they were trying to keep it a secret from everyone and only brought out the small deals menu when we pressed about it we didnt see it advertised anywhere on the tables or in the restaurant and we got the feeling that most of the people in the restaurant had no idea either as they were ordering full courses

of the tapas themselves only two were edible there was a sexy prawn dish that had so much mayonnaise on it we couldnt taste anything else there was also another dish that was drowning in mayo some sort of crab roll but again no taste of crab anywhere in the dish

the pepper and cheese toast was tasty as was the chicken skewer but when you think about it 10 or 15rmb for a chicken skewer is kind of expensive when you can get one for 2rmb right outside on the street all the other things on the tapas deal menu was just meh

we also had trouble ordering the food they misunderstood what we ordered and only brought about 13 of the dishes we requested then we had to wait a while to get the remainder after we called them over and questioned where the rest were

the drink deals were also very confusing it was half price on some drinks from 911 but from 1011 there were deals on different drinks or something we asked several times for clarification but never got a straight answer it would be very helpful if it was written down on the menu or a card on the table even with half off the estrella beers were only about 33cl and cost 50rmb 25 during the deal this much for such a small cheaper quality beer is inexcusable give us a full pint at least

from what ive read they used to have much better tapas selections on wednesday nights im a huge fan of el willy and el efante so its sad to see tomatito fall into the typical shanghai fb trap of starting out very successful and then tapering off into poor quality and poor value for the money

hope they can turn things around, tomatito offers authentic spanish food you can notice the chef is spanish because of the taste and the presentationrestaurant is on a very centric location and the decoration is really cozy you really feel like you were in spain i recommend croquetas gambas huevos rotos and tortilla i would love to give 4 stars because the quality of the food was great but the service was so bad i can simply not do it they took some of the dishes before we finished they forgot to bring half of the food we ordered and we had to remind them several times about the drinks the food and the check i think the restaurants needs professional waiterswaitress to improve customers experience, we went during restaurant week and had a set menu consisting of 7 or 8 dishes every single one of them was yummy and full of flavour will definitely be back, i have been twice to tomatito on different business trips and the atmosphere quality of food and service was just excellent its a very casual but charming place so do visit when you are in shanghai with friends family or colleagues you will not regret it, the team that is developing the chain of restaurants is always capable to differentiate
casual friendly and personal  simply isas work, we have been dining twice in this restaurant for weekend brunch menu they have two week rotating spanish dishes overall the set menu is good value for money also additional wine is cheap for quality some of the tapas was excellent some just ok overall this place is a bit hard to find but offers good value for money recommend to try, this is a good place to meet up after work i went there with colleagues while i was visiting shanghai very good service good drinks and the tapas menu was also decent, went with some friends to the restaurant we made a reservation before we went the place was full and loud the atmosphere was very nice the place is nicely decorated the food is good we let the chef choose our tapas and it turned out to be a good choice liked all the dishes the price was rather high but to be expected in the city center, we went there for lunch on a weekend recommended by a few of our friends

everything we ate was delicious and tasted authentic yet with a flair

the restaurant was well decorated and pretty cool the service was also pleasant and the chef came out to talk to everyone which was a nice gesture

my only feedback is that the place smelled of stale cigarettes when we walked in probably from the evening before i got used to the smell after a while but the restaurant may want to air out the place in the morning or deodorize it before lunch customers walk in sometimes with their children, one of the best tapas i have ever had tried a few dishes and sum up two of the best were explosive tuna and prawn cracker price is quite on a high side but probably acceptable for shanghai, went to tomatito last night saturday for dinner and found that after some while this most excellent tapas bar in shanghai is still going strong and deserves repeated visits this was our fifth visit the quality and variety of foods merits the full expression of tapas the wines are good try a glass of the tempranillo granacha the service attentive but not obtrusive and the chef carlos is doing justice to the reputation of the place and the men and the pricing is reasonable whats not to like

one modest suggestion revise your reservation policy on a saturday night at 700 we called a halfhour before arriving for seating and were politely told all tables were reserved except seating at the bar would that be agreeable no problem but on arriving we were kindly accomodated at a table for two mostly surrounded by empty tables with reserved signs on the tabletop sometime after 800 pm we left and those tables remained empty with reserved signs on the tabletop ya know i just dont understand it yes spanish diners are notoriously late eaters yes on a saturday night others may eat later than 8 pm but  to be told in the early evening that all tables are held in reserve is a discouragement for anyone eating before then, my partner and i were looking for a new place to eat and found this great sounding place everything was average really apart from the interior and atmosphere food was ok service not so especially the girl who served us yes i know im in china and i dont expect everyone to speak english but this girl didnt speak a word no smile even she just plodded the food on the table and walked away its a spanish restaurant so expected more from it waitress agnes i believe was super nice and showed us to our table just a shame she didnt serve us and i think the owner took our order

the drinks are super small for how much you pay its literally 200ml glass for 35rmb estrella draft i think personally i wouldnt come back malabar is still my favourite spanish restaurant, i had the miss fortune of going here last night arrived at 9pm to be shown to our table it then took 15 mins for anyone to notice we were sitting with no menus

once we called some over to take our order they spoke so little english they had to get another server to help with the order taking we ordered 10 different tapas along with a sangria and a beer

drinks took another 15mins to arrive then 10 mins more for the first of our food which was patatas bravas pretty good 30 mins after that still nothing else 15mins after that still nothing

i asked the service staff to check on the food and waited another 15 mins after checking with them again they told me that infact no other food had been ordered for our table i asked to speak to the manager which he openly declined and ran away leaving the waiter with a look of horror on his face he never returned also

after getting over the shock of what was happening and no one returning to our table to take a fresh order we walked out and declined to pay which no one even questioned as im sure they agreed we had every right to do so

i am a chef in shanghai myself and i know that things can go wrong but this was something i have never ever seen and hope i never will see again no fault of the kitchen of course and the patatas bravas we did get was pretty good by china standards

i will stick with other places in sh and avoid this circus, had lunch with my family in march 2016 we tried some tapas but overall the size and the quality was not ok we ordered sepia plancha but got too much legs and very little meat pieces were small and obviously frozen not fresh we got the gaspazho but it was just tomato juice with some oil and vinegar we also tried the ribs but came with semame seeds which is not really what we expected also we tried cocretas de pollo but again a bit dry inside and not much meat i dont think i will try again as you can try better spanish food in town
as for drinks we asked clarita which is beer with lemondade but it was so bitter i cuould not even finish half real pity price was ok, this is a gem of a place in one of the most unlikely places right in the middle of west nanjing 21312 down a bit of a sidestreet the venue is on the 2nd floor and very easy to find the ambiance is great not too big and great for parties of people the cuisine is tapas style and had good taste and flair presentation of the food was excellent and the alcohol free flowing all night made a special evening a perfect place for company get together or a group of friends, el willy did it again with this concept enviroment is awesome food is great alvaro the head chef is the best if you are looking for good spanish food in shanghai stop by this restaurant, what else can you ask for

usually this place is crowded with young adult vibe

excellent for after work drinks and dinner

the place is located in the 2nd floor of a chinese old house right in the middle of downtown

the experience of the tapas is gastronomically pleasant and the service is warm welcoming

they have added a �mexico lindo� dish as a fusion of culinary cultures
 
try the �shrimp montaditos� by chef julio gomez and their �tuna explosion�, tasty tapas and a good atmosphere prices also good and menu has a decent choice popular with the trendy set too, visited this restaurant recently decent food and nice ambient with few mins walking distance from nanjing west station exit 4, weve eaten here on several occasions we love taixing lu as there are several nice bars and restaurants in the area and its easy to get to from metro line 2 nanjing xi lu station tomatito is a small but cozy restaurant the wait staff are knowledgeable about the food and wine and will make suggestions prices are reasonable for shanghai and the servings are generous its fun to go as a group and try many different tapas, ok its a little tricky to find this restaurant as it is tucked away in a quaint courtyard zhang yuan near west nanjing station

find your way there to be treated to great spanish dishes in a relaxed atmosphere weekends there are a set menu which offers great value and in a more quiet environment come evening this place is busting with energy, part of the restaurant chain we were pleasantly surprised at the lovely setting of the restaurant it was housed in a quaint enclave with several restaurants like starling the premise is excellent intimate quiet hip progressive the drinks were good but basic the food unfortunately was a complete disappointment touted as a tapa bar they had used the full meaning of this to provide food of minuscule proportions the empanadas were smaller than a kids pinki really and the other dishes followed the same trend the flavors were nothing exceptional and the prices for that portion exorbitant it was actually offensive that they are allowed to scam customers with such a product clearly give it a miss trust me elsewhere in the world this would not fly, love everything here the atmosphere the food the first time i went there was this loud crowd of guys and girls and the staff didnt stop them because apparently they were friends of the owner i actually was really pissed and thought that i wouldnt come back but the food was too good i went many more times, went here with friends for dinner last week and we had a really nice evening we ordered 10 plates between 8 of us and then had to order another 10 but all of them were really tasty highlights for me calamari was delicious and perfectly cooked and the ribs which were the last thing we ordered

nice selection of cava and wine and the reds not badly priced at all

nice place to go with friends for dinner warm atmosphere and not too expensive, this restaurant is delicious  the food is great the jugs of sangria are lovely a really good restaurant with a good atmosphere and reasonable prices  really good deserts as well highly recommend , i absolutely loved this place really good cheese and meat plate the best patatas bravas the stuffed squid was less but other dishes were very nice the paella was also nice but ive had better, this is a beautifully located lively place with authentic tapas and pretty good service do make a reservation as its likely to be very crowded most days of the week the place is casual the service efficient and the food excellent if going for cocktails stick to the regular drinks like sangria and margarita the pitcher is great to share most of the food is good but certainly the mini burgers chorizo sausages and calamari are good choices, decent wine list attentive service nice ambience and deco but if you go to a spanish restaurant for what most of people go for the food then do not come here
chewy ternera extremely salty tortilla which is made with running eggs but the worse was the paella that is served completely dry so dry that the rice at the top is still hard and uncooked apart that lacks the most important ingredients a good valenciana would have seafood
such a nice place but the food let you down improve on the ingredients and get that paella sorted and i would go back, only spanish can understand some jokes related to food names in the menu related to traditional brands in spain real spanish food price is average a little difficult to find and book table is always crowded good service better on lunch, an evening of excellent tapas great value for money wine list and a relaxed fun atmosphere a real experience in the heart of a converted shikumen lakeway setting would definitely return, ended up here because tap house had a private party the place looked nice when we went in but nobody greeted us which was odd as there were staff around eventually someone asked if we wanted a drink and said we could sit at the bar when i asked if any food was available we were told no this was a shame as they had nice looking sausages and cheese etc in containers on the bar but even they werent available the drinks were fine and reasonably priced but the service didnt improve we were ignored and our drinks order was obviously missed but no apology was given when the drinks did arrive wouldnt return, we live nearby  less than five minutes walk so tomatito has become our extended dining room i think that i have nearly tried every item on the menu and this is for me the best tapas place i know in shanghai

it is located in the chinese court mansion style zhong plaza next to the nanjing xi lu subway
station the restaurant is in the second floor of the north building and you have to go though a flowershop the interior is brighter and maybe a little less elegant than el willy and el elefante but modern and urban a mixed international and local younger crowd is nearly everyday filling the tables  and walkin is often not working 

the menu while having some classics as cuts of jamon and chorizo is modernized a lot of the tapas have an innovative gastronomich touch while remaining focussed on traditional spanish ingredients and flavours one warning it is not really ideal for strict vegetarians but which tapas bar of this world is  but some more vegetable dishes could maybe enhance the menu

i liked on my visits
 croquetas  large rich crunchy deep fried dumplings filled with garliccreamymeaty filling
 patatas bravas delicious came without excessive oil and lighter modern version of garlic mayonnaise
 albondigas melty meatballs in a rich well balanced sweetfruity tomato sauce
huevos rotos  a king of messy mix of barely fried eggs with spicy meat
 small canapes wiht spicy crab meat
 mollete de pato small steamed breads filled with mushrooms tuna melt and spicyduck meat
 cruchy crackers with mild goat cheese and steak  a little beyond the obvious  but delicious

is everything always perfect  no  on one occasion my tuna ceviche with wasabi was a little too watery on another visit some of the canapees were a little too dry on one time the huevos fritos were a little too dry and also on another occasion a little too liquid at least to my taste  but you get a lot of dishes during the evening 35 per person that require such a precision that you cannot blame some imperfections if one would want to be strict razor sharp regarding some imperfections you could also justify a good rating instead of excellent  but the quality of the wine the consistent good quality of the ingredients the mostly precise and vigorous seasoning the fact that the food is served always on time despite that services is sometime appearing a little unorganized is for justifying the best rating

drink list is excellent  you may try a sangria red wine with lemonade and fruits which is better than of what tourists get in spain and i had here some of my best red wines at still reasonable prices in shanghai

i never had really things on my plate that i did not like but you should maybe take care that the chef alvaro ramos you cannot oversee the tall tatooed bearded chef is in the kitchen  full of energy drive and talent he seems to make the difference sometimes when he is off you realize that the kitchen brigade is still learning from him  and that some of the junior chefs are shanghainese because when he is absent you need to ask for salt

service is very nice and trained but some of the juniors are still in the learning mode and not confident enough to handle the sometime demanding noisy crowds in an outgoing way if your request is a little complicate you may want to reach to the two of the senior expatriate staff to take charge of you

for me not only by shanghai standards but compared to tapas places worldwide one of the nicest and best tapas bars in the world, this place is a little hard to find but it is definitely worth the effort the decor and ambience is really fantastic and it was really busy when we went on a thursday night so booking is a must the food is really interesting with fabulous combinations and flavours i will definitely make this one of my new hot spots the price was reasonable for the quality and setting too a great find, nice atmosphere although it�s a little bit noisy for dinner
recommend mini hamburgers foie ham croquetas
do not recommend pincho moruno very low quality meet or huevos rotos they were dry and overcooked
great place to celebrate a birthday with several friends and afterwards go upstairs for a drink at the bar
portions are very small as they are tapas so order enough quantity if you do not want to end up eating street noodles at the lane entrance, this sexy tapas bar is a little jem hidden above a flower shop away from the view of the courtyard entrance affordable tapas definitely a must try if you can make a reservation while the service is all over the place and unorganized they were able to deliver a decent evenings experience perhaps given some more time and training the service will be able to match the standard of their great dishes, i stopped by here for some tapas with friend on saturday night the restaurant is a small tapas bar do not not expect a large space with spacious tables the set up almost looks like a sushi bar we were seated at the bar area we ordered a bottle of wine and a number of tapas correction of error for my next visit would be to only order tapas two at a time at the bar area space is limited for too many dishes at once we started with the 5j iberico and some sliced chorizo both were very good and the portion to cost equation was good too after that we had a variety of tapas for me the standouts were the meatballs and foie gras it is a lively atmosphere that is a bit crowded food is what you would expect from the el willy group which have provided with some of my favorite dishes in shanghai over the years service is quick once you can get a servers attention do not expect a lot of attention this is a definite return trip as i barely scratched the surface of the menu","Taiwanese cuisine",0.999698644220552
22,"to resume is a once in a lifetime experience author cuisine taken to the far limits complemented with one of the best pairing ive had in my hole life
its not just the food but music aromas visuals and textures that make this not only a magnificent culinary experience but an experience itself with its highs that tempted me to stand up and dance
hats of to chef paul pairet and all the staff at ultraviolet, its an incredible experience
the food and drink pairings were overall excellent mostly small bite size dishes enough to make sure youre more than satisfied by the end of the 20 course meal each dish was unique and uv does a great job of telling a story by combing all 5 senses
the staff are well trained friendly and professional they took great care of our group and made us feel like part of the family, the price tag is insanity and i still cant believe we paid that much for this experience however at the same time ive never experienced anything like this so in a sense it was worth the price as there is nothing to compare it to

i am not a foodie nor do i go and try new restaurants or keep up with dining trends i am a working mom with 4 kidslife is sort of crazy and dinners are totally mundane this was such a special treat and way more interesting than a fancy dinner at a fancy restaurant i felt transported into another realm and was fully entertained the entire evening, this restaurant is libertys because of the anticipation attention to details and overall fun creates through the audio and visual accompaniments to the courses

the format of making it like theatre is effective and wouldnt be out of place at any arts festival

the hosts create a perfect atmosphere and a big thanks to colin and carlos who greeted guests well

this will be a meal i will remember for the rest of my life, loved this place it was different and quirky will be a place we remember it<u+00b4>s an experience more than anything else and really gets all the senses going loved the music the smells and the images that are projected onto the walls we had a huge meal each dish was amazing loved the pop rock oyster, this is not all about fine dining but the experience itself is truly unforgettable you will have a more deep appreciation of what you eat and drink realizing that its more than the sense of taste but all senses combined  it does make a big difference

exclusive dining serving only ten guest each time makes it extra special you will be indulge in every course of the meal and will be intrigue as you look forward to whats coming up next and the next its like neverending the food and wine pairing is magic

everyone will feel special for sure although i cant really say this is romantic but i guess it becomes romantic when you share this dining experience with a special someone good to go with group of friends and definitely wont matter even if you go by yourself you will not feel left out at all

great concept and every detail is just well thought of i hope to keep the mystery of it being in a secret place, it took us long time to book 2 seats and the experience is not cheap but is a unique experience that is more than food and drink highly highly recommended, i was able to snag last minute access with my girlfriend because my friends who got a pair of reservations got a notification that two people were ditching their reservation anyway it was a last minute romantic surprise for my girlfriend now fiance and well lets just say the food the experience all amazing there are more staff than customers and really it just spoils us i kind of imagine this is how celebrities get treated when they go out to eat haha, definitely something i dont want to miss on my culinary journey very well executed experience for all senses, ultra avant  garde cuisine by inimitable french chefprovocateur
the atmosphere in the room is fantastic when 10 people are having fun together if its only two it would probably not be the same the experience is made for 10 more people dont fit in the room additionally, great food but best of all is the staging where you seem to be part of the opera i will not spoil it by telling you all the details but here are a few tag lines
it is all about great tastes and combines all your senses smell sight taste into one continuous production
it will make you smile many times throughout the night it is one meal you will not talk through
orchestrated with dance like choreography and the food is coordinated with the drinks not all alcoholic and music and film

if the price does not scare you off and you can get a booking only 10 people per night then you must go the new menu c will be available in november but in the meantime enjoy a and b menus, have been there for menu a and b exciting outstanding and very creative they pair each dish which was like 12 courses with dif wines music holograms and serving all top level looking forward for coming c menu after october holidays, clearly a lot of effort has gone into putting together this epic 20+ course mealturnedthreatre production i was stunned by the seamless execution and lengths that the team went to in order to produce a perfect dinner experience you are taken to a remote warehouse from mr  mrs bund in shanghai where a 10 seat table accompanied by audio and visual effects awaits you

i don�t believe i know how to appreciate great wine as some of the others dining with us did i�m better acquainted with gin but enjoyed the wine pairing as well as the imagination that went into producing such a fantastic experience the dish above is the beginning of a clever dish that lets you create your own noodles a syringe is also involved i won�t give away too much but each course made me smile and some even made us question our own tastebuds

we booked months in advance and this meal is far from cheap even though we opted for menu uvb which is the cheaper option  it was the most expensive meal i�ve had in my life but one that i�ll remember forever, this restaurant appeals not only to your gustatory sense but also your auditory visual and olfactory senses it is an entertainment in itself and one of a kind experience that you will not want to miss when you are in shanghai

i have been there 3 times taking various visiting friends with me and thoroughly enjoyed every occasion however my nonfoodie typea husband felt that the whole thing was way too long despite the fact that he did enjoy the food and entertainment aspect of the whole setting, the food was delicious the warmness of the staffs was also brilliant the atmosphere of the restaurant was damn great and so good for romantic dinner
satisfied, this restaurant is full of surprises  chef paul pairet knows exactly how to draw a story board and integrate it conceptually with his dishes 

it certainly have delivered beyond its visual content when it comes down to the taste of the food itself  or at least for the first 10 courses before it gets derailed

i would have been blown away had the menu been streamlined

as 20 courses in a duration of 5 hours may take a huge toll on the guests mentally  exhausting us to the point where its not fun anymore and the having to endure the feeling of entrapment

despite all that 
its one of those places where youd have to experience at least once  absolutely worth it, the entertainment coupled with fantastelic food was overwhelming staff were fantastic food was ridiculous but in a good way the whole experience was something that my wife and me even years after still talk about and remember cherish and recommend
, how can i describe happiness everyone has his own criteria and own opinion so it is difficult to describe

same for ultraviolet by paul pairet a multisensory dinning experience that can not be described accurately with words you have to try it by yourself

i never thought that fine dinning could be this fun elegant and delicious

worth to try both menus uva  uvb looking forward to uvc

thank you chef paul pairet greg collin carles and the whole team for another magic night at ultraviolet, i decided three months in advance to book ultraviolet for my stay in shanghai at the minute seats were released i attempted to get two seats but for three days was unsuccessful so i mention this as you may find it difficult that being said i occasionally checked availability and two weeks later the table was open probably do to a cancellation i had wait listed but was not contacted i would keep checking if initially unsuccessful and single seats often open up
i have eaten at five pellegrino rated restaurants and ultraviolet held its own the theatrevisual experience was utterly unique and very entertaining my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed the evening worth the effort to find availability and pay the price, it is a mix between great and sophisticated cuisine with show reservation must be done with at least 3 months in advance and the price is 1000 american dollars per person ultraviolet only works with a maximum of 10 persons per night a fantastic experience, what to say more about ultraviolet this is a truly unique experience all your senses are involved the food is extraordinary with perfect service a lot of fun and memory forever, with the food and experience the experience with my friends here was one of the best experiences of my life i just wish i could say the food was the best of my life i found out that i dont have as discerning a pallet as some so the food wasnt the type i enjoy i have no regrets of going though be prepared for a night of richness and intrigue if and when you go, it completely blew me away  food by texture taste servings and the whole experience
thanks from t892 uvb  will see you again , amazing experience together with my spouse very hard to get a reservation and expensive but absolutely worth it, hands down the best restaurant i have visited i have been twice and both meals rank as the best i have eaten takeaway the theatrics of decor sounds smells collection etc and you are still left with amazing food at core of proposition the restaurant is very expensive and reservations are very tough but this truly is a gem it is a credit to paul  his team that sublimotion ibiza has completely ripped off his concept but with limited success definitely 3 michelin stars if the guide ever came to mainland china desperately awaiting my favourite chef to open a restaurant in hong kong, a wonderful evening at ultraviolet i was a bit concerned about whether the reality would live up to the hype but it was extremely well executed with lots of nice touches in terms of presentation service and surroundings
for this type of cuisine perhaps the mandarin oriental in tokyo does it slightly better but in terms of all round experience  especially the really well thought out audio visual accompaniments it was very special there is a very nice touch at the end of the evening where you really see the chefs passion for his creation i will not reveal it as it should be part of the experience when you go there bravo mpairet  i applaud your passion and creativity, this was a great experience the service was top notch the ambiance was perfect for this type of meal with the surround visuals changing with every course i could swear i smelled the seashore when eating the oyster dish
the food was perfectly prepared and there were so many courses i lost count each course was different and paired with the appropriate wine selection
i recommend that anyone who loves fine dining should try this experience at least once a very memorable and fun evening was had by all of us, we are not foodies but we enjoyed this unique experience the 10 lucky guests this evening were all westerners we had the uva+ menu the + for top beverages the host carles was especially wonderful the entire staff was focused on every detail the interior is unique and not easily described by words and pictures it is a true artistic adventure we sat across from one another and we usually request to sit beside each other if you want the luxury of whispering in your dates ear as you share the experience you should request it, thanks to my friend sebastian founder of chefstalk a reservation at the ultraviolet restaurant in shanghai was confirmed on very short notice a lucky break they had a cancelation to make a long story short this evening was the ultimate dining experience ive ever had this dining �happening designed by french chef paul pairet is truly mindblowing each of the 23 dishes were works of art miracles in appearance and taste each serving was illuminated with an intoned digital wallpaper complementary music and spotlights focusing on each plate in addition to the choreographed plate presentation and aesthetic consumption the staff was impeccable paul pairet incl head chef greg robinson host carlos and all of the uv team members were focused and precise all evening and they seemed to have a lot of fun in what they are doing their overall performance including a tour behind the scenes ensured that the dinner will be an unforgettable once in a lifetime experience, blew my socks off innovative evocative immersive i wouldnt consider it a restaurant though more of an experience, no question this is by far the best restaurant evening i have ever had this cannot be considered a simple meal it involves a carefully crafted experience which onvolves all of the senses not to be missed, this is far from what youll experience ever again hard to make a reservation you have to do that online 3 months in advance full within a few minuteshours but worth it about 2025 dishes complemented with a drink set menu just perfect you will not see any imperfection the wall lights sounds staff atmospehere and fragances will make it the most special experience ever the staffservice is like robots hope to get the chance to visit it once again in my life, very innovative presentation of cuisine and wine paring  different multimedia video and audio presentation matching each course of food 35 hours of process of 8~10 courses and one on one service made customer feeling super vip or celebrity

the presentation and process are overemphasized and the food quality is not put at the highest levelthough not bad monocular type of food pricing is a bit at higher level iermb2500head and booking time is too long = 3 months +, yes its expensive but it is so so worth it at least once in your life hence the title its not just the food which is amazing but the whole experience from the moment you step into the meeting place every part of your night is carefully and thoughtfully curated leaving you constantly wondering what might be coming next food purists might disagree with pairets pairing and techniques but if you go in with an open mind you will not be disappointed, luckily i manage to get a table and this is simply the best moment i never enjoy in a restaurant
the dishes only are already worth 3michelin stars but add all the atmosphere and magic and you have something unique and wonderfull
i can only say thank you for this moment it was the best dinner i had, more than a restaurant  an incredible journey  i will never forget  congrats to paul demonstrating again that stars are not necessarily the ones you know , well its not the usual kind of restaurant that i normally go to but this place its truly stunning and unique in its set up after the first amazement at the decor and the bright colours i did not know what to expect as far as the food is concerned the result was simply wonderful a concoction of high end french haute cuisine fused masterly with far eastern influence on it but never the less well executed the diversity is present in the presentation while the taste of classical basis are well maintained
pricey for some people it might be
but if you appreciate good food look no further its worth the hype
if in shangai dont miss out on this experience
well reccomended, ok it is a lot of money there is no way around it however i would gladly give up 45 average premium meals out for one that you wont forget everything is timed to perfection the food is amazing the service is fun and light hearted

this experience could so easily be a stuffy pretentious one but it is the opposite fun whimsical with 3m star food not easy to find

no menu recommendations as that is all sorted by the chef, i enjoyed the night very much
this is a whole complete entertainment for the night yes off course the main thing is the dinner foods but i enjoyed the whole �night� involved in the dinner i tired both uva and uvb� and now so interested in uvc� the price keep raising so hope uvc would be still that i can afford somehow i love his humor having fun attitudes in a very serious and meticulous way regarding the creating the dishes if someone is interested in and enjoy fancy foods i would recommend to try uv at least once <u+f04a>, this is whats possible when a great artistchef and his team are free to conceive the ultimate dining experience

like el bulli this is a indescribable gastronomic journey and an beautiful assault on the emotions and senses but one where the food on your plate is somehow still always the star of the show, one of the single best culinary experiences ive ever had the menu is whimsical and playful especially when paired with the other theatrics  led screens temperature music etc it should be considered a must try but the cost a little prohibitive, excellent place for food wonderfully brilliant staff great place awesome foodi never forget this restaurant, heston is just beginning  paul pariet is the genius

will we be back yes absolutely definitely it would be the reason for going back to shanghai  i want to book the whole table and have just my friends  with no cameras maybe even a race

we were fortunate to meet paul pariet the genius himself his creations left nothing to chance our wishes were fulfilled even before we made them

from the meeting place to arriving at the front door this place and experience is magic nothing is unplanned every step is magically created for you from the tableware and silverware to the music and atmosphere even the visual nothing is without purpose every dish sound taste smell is linked where it should be some of the connectections were obvious some subtle

i danced in the bar during the break and laughed with delight

you should open your wallet pay the whole thing in advance and enjoy

one disappointment fellow diners were all stranger to us and they stayed on their iphones all night taking photos movies and paying games i didnt understand why we have amazing memories of the night, chef paul pairets great idea dishes are delicious and innovativeservers are experienced and ultra high tech dining room well done, crazy fun this is a must do in shanghai but need to book well in advance it will be one of the most memorable meals of your life, uv � menu b � a reflection on the evening�
shanghai has a secret an incredible secret five nights a week chef paul pairet invites ten individuals to dine at his ultrachic hideaway called ultraviolet reservations have to be made months in advance as the venue is pure dreamscape nine of my closest friends and i were lucky enough read effie has connections to secure a full table table 683 on march 17 2015
in the rainbow of colors violet is the last spectrum of visible light the ultraviolet meaning �beyond violet� wavelength range is just outside the human eye�s perception ultraviolet the restaurant is aptly named because chef pairet has architected an immersion for all the senses that is �beyond� belief
partdinner partshow partinteractive experience the 15+ course multidimensional meal is served in an environment where the sounds visuals tactical elements smells and tastes are all choreographed together to illicit a heightened rush no words can truly describe the eats to take a line from an online reviewer �uv is not one of the best meals you�ll ever have it�s �the best�
the food aside uv has impeccable details throughout from the leather armchair that resembles a seat on a gulfstream g650 to the selection of your own switchblade steak knife to the synchronized wait staff�s entree reveals� the unconventional extravagance is palatable
my friends and i who were all dressed for the red carpet took snapshots and selfies throughout the night but no photograph seems to be able to reproduce the colors with the right fidelity the moments� seem� too rich to capture
as a group we are half way through our graduate studies which is a cause for celebration in and of itself yeah us where we will all be in a year�s time is anyone�s guess but for one night this night� happiness and life�s journey seemed to be mentioned more than a few times as we toasted a variety of wines and assorted drinks i�m so fortunate and honored to have met each one of them�
the night concluded with a uv tradition each guest autographs the wall with a metallic pen prior to signing you were allowed to drift down the graffitied corridor to read past inscriptions after more than a few smiles and a personal cocktail at the private bar the night was over my mind was racing trying to quantify my experience as we were then transported back to the city
as the shuttle approached the bund my friends wanted the night to continue i was awash in feelings and quite full honestly the only perfect ending to the evening would be to sleep but we ventured on as a group to unico where we were blasted with the raw beats of salsa the hearty laughs of patrons and the smell of alcohol and tobacco this was an unscripted event which was an overload to my nowuvrefined senses the ten of us actually walked in and walked out� later mustering a final charge to the rear of the lounge and a vessel of mojitos� dancing broke out to the deafening notes�
in reflection uv is a marvelous spectacle to witness and share cheers to chef pairet and the uv staff for an unforgettable evening and many thanks to my friends christy matt angie dennis violet stanley effie cj and cherry for including me on this adventure fight on, this was really a night to remember the constantly changing environment is a great idea its not just 1 restaurant but many  there appears to be some sort of layering in the food that makes each taste appear in order the kitchen appeared to be using a rapid cooling plate that made food cold instead of warm it was all truly delicious but i dont want to reveal everything you should have a try for yourself on a special occasion, amazing experience you need to book well in advance and put a fair bit of money on the table but its worth every penny if you ask me, i took my mother to ultraviolet uv to celebrate shanghai our lives and to provide her with an early birthday present

booking uv was not easy i organized my calendar three months in advance to book two spots on march 3 which was the 1st night they open after chinese new year which i think was table 763 after successfully securing two spots online i wasnt able to pay via paypal from canada i think that there was some weird firewall that prevented payment due to this technology issue i ended up losing my two spots and i was very disappointed after contacting uv by email they put me on their waitlist and eventually got me two spots � a great extra effort by the unnamed host at uv

an early potential logistics hickup by uv was a change to the meeting location from mr and mrs bund to unico with approximately three weeks notice not really a big deal but i received notice of this change only one week prior to my departure from canada to shanghai which was cutting it too close i did not have email access once i left canada another logistics hickup was on march 3 when my mother and i travelled to unico on the bund for the 630pm meeting time and had some trouble finding it unico is on the bund but on a sidestreet considering we are tourists with only english speaking skills there was some slight panic that we wouldnt find unico be late for the departure time and miss the uv experience fortunately two helpful city employees pointed us in the right direction and we arrived at approx 640pm meeting time was 630pm with 7pm departure

having a little trouble finding the meeting place unico was probably the last thing that wasnt close to perfection the rest of the evening was truly sensational starting with a glass of chilled pear cider at unico my mother was so pleased with the cider she considers it one of the many highlights of her uv experience as we sat with the other eight guests uv is single table with 10 guests a night there wasnt much talking other than michelle from orange county and her husband poym
once 7pm arrived we were presented with a copy of the uv menu a on a silk canvas that some guests opened but i kept as a souvenir i plan on opening it up in old age to remember the decadence of my youth after silk menu presentation and knocking back our french pear cider we boarded the private coach that would take us to uvs hidden location

upon arrival of the hidden location you are escorted to a loading elevator for a 30 second ride as the lift door opens there is a host that escorts you to the dining table which is light up in grand fashion with your seat location identified by your name in lights once seated the host introduces himself and provides a little detail around the dinner and overall presentation then one of the most memorable dinners in my life began

every dish is exceptional with personal highlights being the kobe beef cigarette foie gras fish no chips and many of the dessert items which included a meet and greet with the chef himself not to mention a beautiful birthday celebration for my mother rather than describe each course i think that it is best for you to expect incredible creativity with each course which includes pairing of food beverage place setting  cutlery optical display music other sounds and sometimes scents and actors in a restaurant setting that you will never forget

one area of confusion came at time of payment at the end of the dinner all guests were enjoying champagne and other drinks and i was asked to settle my bill my deposit was 50 so i still owed 50 as i was paying i was asked if i wanted to provide a tip i couldnt remember if service charge was included already or not so i tipped on the entire 8000 rmb not really a big deal the incredible team at uv certainly deserved the extra but on the ride home a fellow guest indicated that they did not tip and that no one tips in china i dont know if i was the only person who tipped or not but i think that this could be clarified a little bit on the uv website

overall ultra violet by chef paul pairet and his team was a sensational memory that was the highlight of my trip to shanghai i personally extended by trip three days so that i could dine at the restaurant my mother is retired and travelling around the world and she has been generous to me with invitations to condos she rents to the worlds top cities to reward her i like to treat her to tasting menus of some of the worlds best restaurants including the fat duck in bray uk michelen 3star restaurant gordon ramsay in london uk michelen 3star and la pergola in rome italy michelen 3star during our ride back to unico we discussed her trip to shanghai her uv experience and where uv ranks amongst its restaurant peers and she believes uv was the best of them all    i think she is right, great atmosphere and well done dish are served in fair priceit offers long varieties of good foodthe waiters are absolutely helpfulthanks to the great service and food","steakhouse",0.99975736411593
220,"really disappointing experience how this place is letting down on service and quality i believe can survive only thanks to one time visit of tourists or business man being italian and living in shanghai since years it was once one of my favourite spot but recently really became a rip of place to be carefully avoided you will find only bund price for 100 chinese products advertised as imported therefore sold at 56times local price mainly a restaurant to eat pasta and pizza that is btw cooked on small electric oven so no worst try main course choices at zero starting from 300rmb up for a milanese veal chop wine list as well unreasonably overcharged for basically cheap wine like barbera starting at 280 a bottle or 80 a glass but why instead of wasting money over two italian waiters they do not provide quality food at least aligned to the bill if you keep cheating on customers expecially locals you wont survive long my dear nene good luck, we are regulars at nene favorite is the octupus salad with fennel amazing simple and tasty new are the charcoal powder pizza

wines are a comapred to the food rather low and good quality nothing fancy but a perfect match to the food they are offering

the service is attentive and just right they know all content in the menu communicate in good english and so its safe and comfy, the room isnt too big and with a perfect look as italian trattoria the food is good and presented without frills according to the target of the restaurant
the price isnt excessive but not cheap as i expected
always full of people then well evaluated by everybody, the ambience was nice at nene has a home feeling i found the menu to be very expensive for what it was serving my risotto portion was small and it wasnt that great have had better and the rice was actually undercooked having said that the pizza and pasta my friends had looked good, small restaurant but with very authentic and homely atmosphere you feel like if you were at home the food is very delicious with real italian taste and there is a great choice of wines luca the manager of the restaurant is always very warmly welcoming guests and professional and all the staff and the service are very good and professional as well
highly recommended you should go and try, good italian food in a cozy atmosphere a bit expensive and noisy in case of many customers good service, wow this place is fantastic authentic italian with great providence  you need this after a day in the city the atmosphere is relaxed in this quiet suburban tree lined street its a great find, we called in here for lunch only to find this place was closed it is only open for lunch on the weekends but this shows differently on the app the reviews look fantastic but just wanted others to be aware of this will try it for dinner next time, every visit and every person i am with says the same thing wow great find the food is always good service even better which in shanghai is not easy to say unpretentiously good food in a great environment that makes you want to make a reservation for your next visit as you leave i am currently obsessed with the squid ink risotto, i only started doing reviews on trip advisor this month so never had the chance to do one in the city of my current residence but since i have started need to put out this review for nene where we have been going to almost every week for our family lunches for the past 4 years the environment is casual comfortable and service is superb pizza and pasta are great with fresh ingredients except for the scallops as they are frozen clams and lobster pieces are quite good our all time favorites are the san daniele ham w buffalo mozza caserecce aglio olio lobster angel hair spinach and ricotta ravioli 4 cheese gnocchi mushroom risotto and pizzas margherita san daniele and arugula and the list just goes on and the specials make the selection a bit fresh for regulars like us and numerous other families that we see weekly what we hope for nene is to sustain the quality and service as the founder santo has just taken a leave from china and we know behind the good food and consistency is his complete dedication, relaxed restaurant with delicious fresh proper italian food one of if not the most enjoyable meals in shanghai would recommend the fresh homemade pasta dishes and cantucci e vin santo good selection of wines and beer, our favorite restaurant in the four years we lived in shanghai small intimate locale with the owner present and available at all times the service always relaxed and attentive but not overbearing the food always excellent portion size are moderate not as large as in many american restaurants but definitely adequate the price reflects a reasonable price for the quality of the food which in shanghai is high compared to other cities for those familiar with puxi the prices are not exorbitant

spaguetti aglio olio was magnificent fish was delicious eggplant parmesan the same wine was very good

now that we just moved away from shanghai we still dream of coming back just to visit this restaurant many lovely memories were built there and it is frequented by regular customers who are find this lovely restaurant the ideal place to relax and enjoy and share a meal with friends or even alone

reservations recommended especially for the weekend, nene is the best italian restaurant which ive never seen in italy
the owner the personnels the athmosphere and all the foods are perfect
when im at shangai my first place, every time i go to nene i try to order something dfferent but my favorite is the sea food risotto i tried this dish in many restaurant but this one is the best the place is small busy in the weekend staff is serious alwys taking care of my needs best italian in town, i am going to nene every now and then for the past two years and each time i have been there i think afterwards im not going often enough i went for all kind of occasions with my wife with friends my kids and even on my own and i always enjoyed the food and just being there nene is not particularly stylish and not the cheapest place around but it is a nice little restaurant with an open kitchen a simple but cosy interior and just serves nice italian food hope to make it again soon, one of my former team members recommended this as his best place for italian in shanghai he has lived there 17 years so we had very high expectations nene did not disappoint the intimate dining room has a very classic old shanghai feel consistent with location in former french concession area note that it was just a little hard to find on a street off the main tourist areabut well worth it the food was exceptional we each ordered something a little different and everything was fantastic the homemade ravioli is incredible as were the pizzas calzones and risottos the service was perfectanticipating what we needed but not hovering perfect for families travelers and couples just perfect in every way not to be missed, came here for dinner with a friend have tried to walk in before but it is always full so you need to book the service wasreally good helpful attentive and experienced staff werecompletely on top of everything for our whole meal we ordered the charcoal pizza which was great and we chose toppings that were different from the menu with was no bother at all we also had fennel salad and ravioli all 3 dishes were superb we ordered wine and it was presented really well id say this is one of my favourite places nowservice alone is some of the best and with great food as well the price was good too we paid 200rmb each  i would have happily paid more, i have visited nene 3 or 4 times now and have every intention to return the ambiance service and food quality are all above par and in shanghai that equals a win yes the longer you live here the lower your expectations become but it becomes obvious that with the open kitchen and the full tables that nobody is hiding anything and the customers are well satisfied i havent really tried anything that was overly amazing or terrible just good food and the happiness each time i dined there is what has me returning again and again

i do have mixed feelings about this review though because i would like to send business to nene knowing it would help them stay open in a city that changes restaurants weekly but it also means having to book a reservation earlier in advance as more people find out about this gem in the former french concession, this is one of my favorite italian restaurant in shanghai great food lovely cozy atmosphere excellent service wide choice of meat fish pasta and risotto wine list is good even if a little too expensive i have been here many times and the quality is constant do not miss it, we went for dinner yesterday  must have been our 10th visit and we always enjoy the quality of the food and drinks reasonable and good wine recommendations by the owner our favorite is the risotto, its now my favorite italian restaurant in shanghai the environment is very cozy and food is just great must try their pamigiana risotto and dessert you will enjoy too, food taste really good so you can see that they are using great ingredients the enviroment its also good a cozy floor that make you feel eating in your grandmothers kitchen but a bit expensive of course good things have a price, absolutely terrible food getting bad or mediocre food in shanghai is very very common even though there is a lot of hype about shanghai and its restaurant scene the truth of the matters it really is not true
we tried this place because we had heard that the food is good after having it i can assure you the food is terrible and overpriced for the quality
i ordered arabietta pizza it was a watery pizza with soggy tomatoes and crust the mozzarella must have been store bought go to mercato or bottega for fresh mozzarella on your pizzathe rocket salad was drenched in dressing and terrible it had yellowed leaves in it i witnessed the owner or manager serve bread he dropped on the floor i kept looking hoping he would not put iit back in the basket but he did and served it with all due respect to people who think this great italian food they must have not have good italian food before there are places like mercato where you get great food ambiance service and worth every penny this nene is over priced for the lousy food they serve absolutely a disaster i felt obliged to leave a review just to save others from having bad food and spending money shanghai is full of places like this if you want good food go to mercato i read another review about nene that in german it means no no it is so true no no do not go there yuck, enjoyed a reasonable italian meal in pleasant surroundings i had ravioli and my friend had a tomato and mozzarella pizza both were ok and my ravioli was above average we ordered a bottle of pinot grigio and unfortunately didnt look closely enough at the prices  the wine was <u+00a3>46 and of average quality a real rip off  beware we concluded with tiramisu  lacked coffee flavour for our pallets the total bill was nearly <u+00a3>120 for 2 people and can you believe it the manager wanted to rush us from our table to accommodate more diners  we had only been in 1hr not the best italian in shanghai  there are better in summary nice surroundings with a good atmosphere average cuisine over priced wine, this is one of the best restaurant in shanghai you can enjoy a wide choice of food from handmade pasta to pizza meat and fish excellent wine list cozy atmosphere for a small place for a maximum of 40 people, we have been coming back to nene for the last 2 years and this is one of the best italian restaurants in shanghai fantastic cold cuts pasta and pizza the italian owner who is always there is very nice helpful and service minded this is not the cheapest of restaurants but we are happy to pay a little more for this food we will  as always come back to this little gem, i have eaten at nene at least 6 times in the past year and have always been delighted by the food the service and the pleasant atmosphere the owner from italy has always been present at the restaurant and very involved in the kitchen and running of the restaurant i strongly recommend the eggplant parmigiana appetizer the italian pasta dishes and all of the homemade ravioli dishes my favorite is the pumpkin and the smoked eggplant was highly rated by my friend having grown up in nyc i am had the pleasure of eating great italian food all my life  and i would seek out nene if it was in nyc highly recommended when you have had enough lazy susan dumpling feasts  or just feel like excellent italian food it is a bit pricey but well worth it, a quiet side street in shaghais historic french concession a small but relaxed italian restaurant very good to excellent food with quality service and no rsuh rush rush excellent, we have eaten at nene a couple of times once with our 3 young children at lunch time and again just the two of us yesterday evening both times we were delighted with the quality of food and service, strange to think about eating really good if a little pricey italian food in the heart of shanghai  but that is nene  and i suppose that is shanghai too  the meeting point of east and west food was very good  risotto done to perfection and the minestrone soup full of flavour with firm vegetables nice soft atmosphere in a very interesting and increasingly vibrant part of the city wide selection of choices and a gentle service  greatly appreciated, visited with 2 colleagues solid rustic italian fare in the french concession area smallish only about 12 tables go before 800 to avoid crowds the ravioli and the farmers linguini a puttanesca really were quite good note likes many places in shanghai this does not accept amex bottom line you wont go wrong here if you want an alternative to dumplings, went to nene with a friend i made reservation in advance the ambiance is good laid back and informal frequented mostly by foreigners than local folks
they have a good wine collection the sicilian wine was great the food was fantastic as well

return  yes, the angel hair pasta with scallops was delicious but it was a bit costly service is very good and despite the crowd i am grateful they were able to accommodate us so last minute without a reservation appetizers like the eggplant parmesan are very large so they could definitely be shared by two people will definitely return to try more of their selections, went to nene for a dinner with a colleague restaurant was packed but we were offered last two seats by the bar which was fine good selection of wine though a little bit on a pricey side they also serve aperol spritz  food menu is pretty long it has different pasta dishes pizzas and mains we shared antipasti platter and a pizza pizza was quite light and crispy antipasti was good some of them were very tasty and delicate others were nothing to rave about like a small cubes of lasagne which were cold and lacked depth overall a good restaurant nice atmosphere, we called on a saturday night around 6 and got the last table of the night by walking over right away very quaint and cozy my 2 kids werent the only onesalmost every table had a kid or two maybe because it was so early my daughters gnocchi was terrific the bruschetta sampler was great a little expensive but a nice treat will go back, this is one of those places where you want to go back a dozen times in a row to try out the menui had a calzone for lunch and im cannot rave about how its the best food in the worldbecause it was a calzonebut it was a very good calzonefor example it had several varieties of mushroomsnot the expected canned mushroomsand if they can do that with a calzone i cant wait to find out what they do with pasta

for a place with such great reviews on their pizzas it seemed odd that their kitched didnt have a wood fired brick ovenbut after tasting the crust of the calzoneim convinced that the fancy oven would have only provided additional asthetics and not additional taste

this restaurant is located on a quiet tree lined streetwhich is a dramatic departure from the high congestion of most of shanghaithe interior of the restaurant is also very relaxed and comfortablethe service was friendly and prompteverything in this restaurant invites you in and makes you want to stay

now the best partthe tiramisuwow

one other thingi almost didnt go to this restaurant becasue on the tripadvisor page it says something about meals ranging from 900 to 3000 rmbthis is an errorpizzas are approx 128160rmb the calzone was around 160rmb the tiramisu was 58rmb if i remember correctlyi dont think you could pay 3000rmb for dinner here unless it lasted a week

very happy with this restaurant, we have lived in shanghai for over a year now and have searched for a great authentic italian restaurant i found nenes on trip advisor and the ratings are true and accurate if you are looking for an authentic italian restaurant it is worth going we had a salad lasagne and a calzone the pizzas were coming out of the kitchen like crazy and they looked amazing the service was exceptional this restaurant is very small so i would advise to make reservations before going so you arent disappointed, nene is not simply a restaurant it is a heaven of taste ambiance and service in the heart of shanghai located in one of the most famous streets for entertainment in the french concession nene welcomes customers in a chic space where everything from lighting to furniture from decor to music preludes to the perfect dining experience waiters are wonderfully attentive without ever intruding and meals enfold as smooth as the gorgeous southern italian wine that the restaurant keeps in its impressive cellar
however what impresses the most about nene is food italian and mediterranean dishes are prepared with the best ingredients and an exquisite touch as well as a perfect sense of quantity try especially the seafood pasta with fresh mussels or indulge in the perfectly baked pizzas everything is a feast for the palate i�ve been coming to this restaurant since my first visit to shanghai in 2011 and i still haven�t found any better place in the city i strongly recommend it, i like nene very much couzy admosphere good food and friendly staff everyone that likes italian food should visit, i visited nene for lunch on a sunday a small casual and cosy restaurant they had a sunday brunch menu for about rmb200head which comprises mainly egg and toast items for main we did not opt for the brunch menu as we like to try some of their house specialties like pizza and pasta they have an extensive drink list and a la carte menu complete with starters pizza pasta main and desert price is really on the high side averaging rmb150 for pizza and pasta when i was there 80 of the patrons were italian families so its strong confirmation that the food is authentic italian we had a 4 cheese pizza and a sausage caserecce  both were perfectly done and prepared with top grade ingredients the food and location score as what needs improvement badly is the service staff whom are inexperience and did not understand the menu the italian owner is usually around so check with the owner if need recommendation or explanation of the menu, this is an excellent restaurant the food is fantastic and the service very good there is a wide choice of italian dishes and a good wine list i am italian and can judge the quality this is one of the best italian restaurant in shanghai will come back for sure, was told the best italian food  i agree hand made pasta with great flavour salad is so fresh and big healthy portion small but nice homely atmosphere must reserve as its a small venue friendly service staff simply yummy, it is not cheap but for the size and the quality that u having this place is great i loved their fresh pastas  pizza the owner focus in premium quality products and good portions we had san danielle pizza with gorgonzola tuna carpaccio a fresh fettucini with sea urchin  so yummy biscotti with vino santo 2 large bottles of san pellegrino  an espresso700 rmb that is around 120 dollars no cheap but for the quality is very good the decor is italian rustic small only 20 people and located bellow a popular bar called the apartment i recommend you if you tired of chinese food and u want drinks after dinner with walking distance apartment shelter el cocktail jz bar all at 30 seconds walk from there, ate with some friends from out of town my 3rd visit and delighted to say just as expected again beef carpaccio seafood pasta extra notch of chilli  stunningly simple but stunningly good friend had the mozzarella followed by the red snapper he couldnt talk for savouring when you couple this with decent wines a warm welcome from the owner it makes for a great way to spend the evening bravo id love to keep this place a secret but it just wouldnt be fair go early or book a table to avoid disappointment, scrumptious gnocchi and a fennel salad with a glass of white wine from campania
owner working the floor and totally on the ball aware of everything that is going on
good lighting and ambiance
pricing a bit on the high side but ok given the high quality fresh ingredients
the ricotta on the salad was super light and delicious, restaurants in shanghai tend to be designed to impressed the visitor by the size and the decoration nene is an exception in the local scene located in the former french concession you really have the feeling to enter an authentic italian family restaurant

the decoration and the food are up to the level family cooking style but with a modern twist a really great place to enjoy a meal between friends and share food, great little neighborhood restaurant everything really fresh and delicious great italian wines the place was packed from 73010 while we were there so call for reservations as the place is small, when im out of italy i usually dont go to italian restaurants however i went to nene in shanghai and i think is one of the best italian restaurants ive ever tried
the atmosphere is warm and friendly thanks to the owner santo and his kind staff
the awesome food is made with highest quality italian ingredients try the lasagnas and i loved his wide wines choice 50 or more different bottles also the handmade pizza is very good
my advice is to reserve a table because the seats are limited, this very easy going restaurant is a great place for a quick jump if you are missing italy too much italian cook and italian owner very reasonable price and very good quality for simple italian food my spaghetti aglio olio e peperoncino were excellent, this place was recommended by a client and turned out to be a gem very fresh ingredients and nice flavors blending together well managed and service was great it was a late dinner so we only sampled the assorted antipasta and a salad both were excellent esp the antipasta next time we go back we will be ordering more its a small restaurant so make sure to book in advance","French cuisine",0.572509790898837
221,"what to say best pizza in shanghai after 1 week of local food i was missing home flavors found marzano pizza and loved it fresh ingredients good pizzas nice service well done, if youre a regular at pizza express you will be pleased to find marzano its pretty much the same great pizza  good value  friendly service nice location in the trendy xintiandi area, pizza pasta and some others i liked the dough of the pizza thin and light combinations are ok and you can order half pizza one flavor not so far from other italian restaurants in shanghai with prices almost double, good pastas and pizzas at xintiandi the dessert was very tasty too food 8510 service 910 cleanliness 810, quick service nice pizzas service is good most of the staff are reallyice for wifi you need chinese mobilenumber that is ampitty good food for good prices, quite surprising went to that place earlier and it has improved dramatically food has been very well prepared and loved their carrot apple juice their salmon pizza was amazing will probably come again also love their restaurant at west nanjing road quite good both of their stores used my credit card offer to pay rmb 78 and to get 100  purchased 2 vouchers and paid the remaining balance of rmb 9 separately, very good place lot of restaurant in thus areai be seat in marzano its good salad and good pizza very nice envaiorment when you seat outside good service to , the food is delicious and we enjoyed it a lot fell in love with their carbonara quite cheap but the taste is superb, youve been warned this place had a waiting list thought thats a good sign waited 10 minutes to be seated menu was good drinks we good pizza was awful

staff seemed to try but i wont ever be back, i love their pasta carbonara it tasted so great it made me order another plate pizza was also good and the cocktails were fantastic friendly and attentive staff efficient and fast service nice location and atmosphere can get little bit crowded though good value for money nonetheless, located in the k11 shopping centre serves great pizzas also available as lunch deal friendly service and nice atmosphere, mozela pizzeria lovely pizzas with ample choice friendly staff with flexible attitude and decent english indoor and outdoor seating with a pleasant atmosphere kids treated nicely and a kids menu is available my kids loved the pasta bolagnes as well as dough balls with nutella, located in beautiful xitiande this restaurant provides outstanding pizza with great ambience my suggestion is the peking duck pizza is exceptional between 27pm there is a happy hour on beer with 50 off which makes 2 pints of hoegarden just $8 pricing of the food is good value with 13 inch pizzas priced between 50rmb and 120rmb service is fast and efficient, good italian food and pleasant atmosphere with the opportunity to dine alfresco in the nice xintiandi walking area, had a starter and pizza for dinner pizza was good made in an openkitchen so you can see what they are doing
staff was friendly quick good english, this is in the pedestrian area along with all other bars and cafes has outside seating and a large seating area inside its meant to be pizza express however from be very slow service and the soggy pizza it fails the base of our pizza was so soggy the salads are boring the mushroom soup which was the soup of the day was okay average prices, relatively expensive but pleasant eatery in the lovely wine and dine area of the city good food and drinks selection and they even serve the very large hoegarden beers for the ale lovers, italian food reasonable price very good location should improve service outside table available, if you want to have a quick dinner at a reasonable price and quality marzano offers it with a good variety of types of foods service quick and caring the customers, we ordered a carpaccio salmon salad which was very nice and a pizza after both pizzas with and without tomato sauce were good the italian white wine was ok but too warm so we ordered an ice cube the ambiance is nice and crowdy like always in xintiandi first there was no place on the terrace so they put us inside but later they moved us to the terrace service ok, i ate there with my colleague usually i dont like eat italian food outside of my country we ate pizza the tasty and the quality were good the price little expensive but in china this is the price for a pizza, from all the restaurant chains in shanghai pizza express is my favorite one the pizzas are really great and all other dishes more than just decent not for fine dining but great with kids or some casual meet with friends the marazano is not particularly my favorite branch as it is in the busy xintiandi area with its many tourists which i usually try to avoid inside it feels a bit like a canteen but the food is at the expected level, good pizzas and salads  cozy and fresh  outside is good on day time  selections of flours are good  if want to have a fresh italian pizza must stop but nothing special, located in the old french concession area of xintiandi the marzano is a quiet relaxing place to eat great pizza as a vegetarian i had the lava which included polenta as a topping but was excellent

service was friendly and prompt

prices were reasonable for its upscale shanghai location, nice italian restaurant with delicious food and beautiful ambiencegood option for vegetariansoutside and inside sitting, this restaurant is located in a very nice zone the pizza was great its has a thin crust we ordered calabresa and 4 cheese they were excellent great flavor the service was very good definitely an excellent choice, ive been to this place a few times and the pizzas are very good they have two different styles of crustsboth of which are excellent they have all of the standard western pizzas that you would expect but they also have a few innovative ones to the region my favorite pizza is the honey chicken pizza and my local coworkers really enjoy the peking duck pizza

pizzas range from about $1520 and a hungry adult male could pretty much take down an entire pizza maybe 12 slices short depending on the pizza sizethey vary based on which one you pick

as a starter weve tried the dough ballsi wouldnt recommend

if not for the price i would have given this place 5 stars, my coworkers and i tried this early on in our business trip and lets just say it was so good that we were back three days later i consider myself a pretty good judge of pizza and this is some of the best i have ever had if you enjoy a nice crispy thin crust this is your place we tried five different pies all had great flavor with the crust being exceptional the desserts and service were great as well this will definitely be one of the first places i eat on my return trip this is also in a more upscale area of shanghai with shopping close by, so we wanted pizza while visiting china close to our hotel andaz xintiandi we happened along this restaurant nice outside seating service was great and pizza after a bit of napkin soaking the grease off the top was tasty
for the convenience and the varied menu i would try it again, so this is the other name for pizza express the pizzas are basic but good and they can do wide adjustments to whats on the menu to meet your preferences i am fussy with pizza and it is hard to find places that let you make adjustments to the menu in china it is not gourmet dinning but the staff are friendly and the food is good this has become our go to pizza place in xintiandi, basically a pizzaandpasta place with some salad thrown in serve its purpose as a quick food variation without spending a lot of money which in xintiandi is not such a difficult thing to do the salads are actually ok pizza is rather disappointing and standardly bland pizza prices in the region of 90130 rmb, this place is located at the most happening area of the city you can find lot of restaurant and bar and it is very difficult to choose were to eat and in our case all the more becoz we are pure vegetarian which means no fish no seafood no meat no egg normally my husband has a habit ofof getting
��, we had a great experience here we ordered a large cheese and meet tasting plate followed by pizza everything was good bordering on authentic the service was efficient and attentive nothing took too long and the atmosphere was relaxing while its true that one should not go all the way to shanghai just to eat pizza some of my family
��, i know good pizza this pizza is not bad this pizza is not good this pizza is just fine its dry its not too cheesy the bread is soso good for a quick lunch or solo dinner the waitstaff is consistently attentive the problem is the management if you want to use a nonchinese credit or debit card the waitstaff
��, i was here 2 times before first the pizza was far too small second time one hour waiting time the wrong pizza with very few toppings and lots of empty space i complained via customer survey and got an invitation for a free meal so todays comment is about a free meal made and served with extra care service 5
��, we are europeens used to eat greattt to excellent food and got to try an another italian in xintiandi who was in front of marzano and we were desperate to just find average pizzathis onemarzano if you re really hungry and looking to eat something great is a very great spot to stop buydefenitly a place to recommand +the waiter
��, recommended by a local and very good our pizza was excellent one of our party ordered a spaghetti dish and was disappointed in the offering but baaed on other comments may not have been the norm the large local draft beer is served in a glass the size of a small bucket and a great deal not bad at all
��, expect to pay around 100 kuai for a 10inch pizza  also the dough doesnt taste as authentic  crusty as in the past atmosphere of the place feels like a fast food restaurant it is quite loud and families bring their children even pizza hut is quieter than this  would not recommend for a date on top of
��, good pizza place and internationallyitalian dishes this chain from hong kong is an easy place with kids fast and good service with good trained and patient staff kids love the pizzas and the pasta dishes and there are good options for salads and pasta for adults too coffee is good and kids menu has everything for the little one from
��, i am actually writing this review whilst sitting in this restaurant for the third consecutive time my family and i were disappointed to find that they again didnt have any dough balls or garlic bread left what will they say next time no pizza disappointing since pizza express is one of our favourite restaurants in shanghai, you might think it should be embarrassing to go to shanghai and have pizza well im from the uk but live in japan and sometimes you just want that comfort food experience its definitely pizza express but branded pizza marzano for some reason i cant work out they used the same brand in hungary also last time i was there

anyway great thin crust pizza you can if i remember rightly choose the type and they have at least some of the same menu favourites as back home the have the same wine also not cheap but there you go if were being honest xintiandi is a tourist area after all dessert list was a bit limited possibly but the garlic bread starter was unexpectedly huge all in all we had a nice relaxed time and went back to our hotel happy and content

service was good and delivered with a smile, im english but live in australia so i get very excited when i go anywhere that i can get a pizzaexpress fix the menu is similar to the uk but not exactly the same

pizzas are good but we found the food came out in a strange order my boyfriend received his entree and main within two mins of each other and i received my pizza and then the entree about 10 minutes afterwards bit weird but still worth a visit when visiting shanghai, im italian living in shanghai and as a good italian i can not stay without pizza once a week
every time i want pizza i go to pizza express in xintiandi this place has the best pizza pizza here are really good same as the once i can eat in italy
pasta is also good but they tempt to put chili spicy in all the pastas sometime is good sometime it covers the taste of the all dish
they have very good appetizers as well as very good salads
the location is nice they have 2 floors and some table also outside during summer is beautiful to stay outside and enjoy a nice weather with a nice pizza, unfriendly and incompetent staff i got there with my wife and my dog small very quiet and calm poodle around 345pm on sunday after waiting for over 20 minutes we finally saw a table free up close by the road on the corner of their outside seating area naturally we quickly grabbed it as an earlier table was taken by passerbys even though we have told the staff we are waiting for a table for two

after being seated they started to clear off the table and only then they told us in a very rude way that we will not be served if we are seated there with our dog this is in my opinion no way to run a business they could have told us from the start that we are not allowed to bring the dog and not make us wait for over 20 minutes just to tell us very rudely to leave

i do understand that people get annoyed with dogs when they bark and interfere with the staff or interact with other clients but our dog was sitting calmly under the table

we then left and went to kabb which had no issues with us taking her there they have always been very friendly towards smaller dogs which i can recommend for anybody with a smaller or medium size dog kabbs food lunch and afternoon tea menu are great also starbucks which have a similar location to marzano allows you to sit down put your feet up and take your dog with while enjoying a nice afternoon with a coffee and sandwich in the sun

my suggestion go to kabb or starbucks and avoid pizza marzano and if you do crave for a pizza order dominoes

a nice environment with fairly expensive food that is nice enough but in any western country would not do well on the plus side the salads looked good, this place is very good  great pizza good salad and a very nice restaurant in amongst the mixed bag of xintiandi restaurants this is a good honest pizza restaurant good service and excellent pizza, pizza marzano is part of the english group pizza express i would say as a pizza writer that pizza marzano has the best pizza in shanghai they have 5 shops pizzaiolos are highly trained pizzas are still handmade opened the pizza have individual size and we recommend the salmone affumicato andor the giardiniera, for a decent pizza in a tourist area of shanghai xintiandi you cant go wrong with pizza marzano we prefered the thinner crust version that they had its all fresh and quite decent, used to frequent pizza express in london so we had mixed feelings about going to a fancy sitdown pizza joint in xtd it was very good from the salad starter to the pasta and pizza we chose all were tasty our only complaint was the price but we knew that going into the restaurant try it","sport bar",0.999752687504381

and we were not disappointed as is often the case � especially in china this is a �real� authentic italian restaurant the chef is italian and makes superb dishes in china when going to an �italian� restaurant they normally use local ingredients that just doesn�t cut it as they always miss the mark and you end up with �sortaitalian� dishes with an asian flair

not at prego they fly in buffalo mozzarella meats and even flour for their freshly baked bread directly from italy daily and it shows

the menu selection was extensive and each of the dishes we had over the three meals we had there was firstrate italian sublime italian

to top the experience off we were taken care of by claudia � also authentic italian she was a perfect hostess with menu recommendations attentive service and a joy to talk to

if you like italian food and are in shanghai make your way to prego easy to find as it is in the westin at the bund � the lotus leaf topped building

splendido, a very disappointing visit

several of the dishes on the menu were unavailable  the meat slicing machine wasnt working so no antipasti they kitchen had run out of vegetables for the vegetable soup and could not provide chillies for a pizza

the draft tiger beer was flatter than the ambience of the fairly empty restaurant

service had a sneer after we complained about the lack of availability of the menu items

watched the staff remove a dirty table cloth from one table and replace it with another dirty and crumpled one  poor quality and training

a poor experience in a restaurant and hotel than should offer much better, have a meal at prego if youre looking for real italian dishes the dishes are of high quality which are reflected in the prices but it is well worth it remember to save some space for the desserts, my business partners and i had an amazing meal at prego great selection of wine reasonably priced delicious salads and homemade pasta that melts in your mouth the maitre d claudia added the finishing touches allowing us to relax decompress and enjoy dinner at the pace we wanted i highly recommend this restaurant, really wonderful tasty and authentic restaurant in shanghai great soups apitaizers salads main dishes and deserts i highly recommend this restaurant, prego is a lovely dining destination it offers a menu with plenty of variety dishes are good value for money though wine can be on the slightly pricier side its hard to get authentic flavours and really fresh ingredients in china or so i hear so i was pleasantly surprised when i dined here, went for business dinner at prego and got invited to join the free flow champagne and international wines offer absolutely great price value offer for 588 <u+00a5> get all you can eat plus free flow of taittinger champagne and free international red and white wines and beers had fantastic italian cheese olives ham salami focaccia etc antipasti followed by awesome napoli style pizza with lots of fresh san marzano tomatoes and red then beet risotto with gorgonzola later tasty orecchiette pasta with chili ricotta and eggplant dessert was homemade authentic italian tiramisu with affogato espresso w vanilla icecream and limoncello from amalfi coast great service included unique opportunity for tasting all the best of italy in one evening forza prego thank you to giulio louise saverio and irene and all other prego angels, thanks thomasand all staff in the prego restaurant 
for the food and for your ancients flavors veri good, i had dinner at prego with a colleague of mine and we ordered two authentic italian pizzas after some high quality traditional appetizers the service was excellent from every single member of the staff and the atmosphere in the restaurant is enjoable and appropriate for one of the most historical building of the bund, wonderful dinner here at prego
the service was top class they took good care of our different diets and helped us choose the best the food was so good you got the real feeling of italian cuisine great italian managertall guy who was extremely nice, my colleague want an italian restaurant after many days stay in shanghai found this restaurant in trip advisor

the food tasted good and dessert is great the service is excellent however the price is on the high side the starter is 198 yuan and a panna cota is 98 yuan it can be easily 600 yuan per pax for 3 course meal here

good for ambient and if you really want italian food dont mind to come here if i am on business trip again

spg member got 15 off, after reading all the good reviews we decided to go to prego for dinner the restaurant was not very busy we ordered some appetizers and two pasta dishes one of the pasta dish was served lukewarm we asked for some chili flakes and the server came with a tiny bit it looked like it was a leftover from previous tables the service was not that attentive despite the restaurant being not busy at all menu wise they do have a good selection for both food and wine, definitely an authentic italian restaurant very good food and very good wine pasta is cooked as it should be i need to say the chef saverio gives a boost to this restaurant he is highly skilled in the kitchen and an extremely nice person to have a chat with
im a big fan of the sunday brunch to be enjoyed with free flow of champagnehighly recommended, great selection of pasta dishes try the spaghetti with truffles and parmesan i would definitely recommend it for special occasions

js, such lovely authentic italian restaurant in the westin shanghai very attentive staff reading every wish from yr lips awesome italian atmosphere very best value for money deal on fridays offering all you wish to eat paired with free flow french champagner and international wines similar to sunday brunch but on a friday evening  delicious tasty truly italian, first time in this restaurant for lunch the feeling is great only few tables for lunch which i didnt expected for this kind of hotel however the service could be a bit more professional in term of food knowledge the food was ok lunch set semi buffet there are better options in town for a lunch, prego is an outstanding italian restaurant in shanghai one of the best indeed recently they have started every friday night to offer free flow of champaign and international wines paired with limitless italian delicacies from the huge antipasto buffet to as many main courses you want to desserts with no end all at a very reasonable price prego offers the first sunday brunch on a friday evening awesome have to try reservations very much recommended, whilst staying at the westin we decided to eat in the hotel for a change for local cuisine and the weather outside wasnt great weve eaten in this chain in the united states and enjoyed and this was no different the restaurant wast busy but the staff were attentive and the food of a very good standard slightly more expensive than our usual experience but to be expected within a 5 hotel and certainly not excessive recommended, prego restaurant great choice for my business dinner and thank you chef vito for having looked after us and for your recommendations regarding the food and the wine i can tell chef vito loves his job because of the  love  he put in our every single dish that we have tried  carpaccio fish caccio pepe pastatiramisu  warm chocolate cake home made bread etc he also found a little time to talk to us and told us about his experience around the world i wish i could have had more time to listen to your lovely stories about the food

we all left super satisfied and a big thank you again
will definitely return soon, last week i was in shanghai for business
prego was a great discover the ambiance is a little bit old for the shanghai standards but the food was amazing
the italian chef come at the table to give us some suggestions about the food the yellow fish in crazy water the mushroom and truffle risotto was absolutely perfect and the chocolate orange cake with strawberry cappuccino mmmmmhhhh unforgettable my friend told me that the duck wit rucola and spicy chocolate was incrediblethe service was a little bit less than the food but really good absolutely suggested, at shanghai for business we went in pro with a friend to eat some italian food and surprise finally a innovative menu with hot respect of italian traditional cuisine the service was a little bit chinese style and the waiter dont speak good english but the food was super the chef came at table and give us suggestions on food and beverage moreover he cutter a incredible amazing 1 kg tbond at our table the wine was a little bit expensive but good as dessert the tiramisu and the chocolate cake was simply wow we will back thank you chef vito, the first floor buffet is superb the 2nd floor prego is nothing special the best thing about the meal was the salami pizza several dishes were cold and they had problems keeping the items replenished, we have been waiting long for a new star to rise at westin prego italian restaurant finally it has happened prego e rinascito prego is back as one of the hottest restaurants in town thanks to awardwinning chef mr vito bellomo
incredible delicious amazingly decorated artistic style culinary masterpieces dishes like paintings from the louvre endulge yourself in tastes you have not dared to dream about come and taste heaven freshest caprese with rucola spaghetti melting on your mouth crusty pizza with the flavor of italy and divine tiramisu ask for vitos favourite cocktail and be surprised this man is a real magician, manytimes ive been in prego westin bund cause im a starwood platinum member
anyway  prego just arrived a new italian chef thats brought his long worldwide experience and especially the passion for italian cuisine he follows up every detail sourcing food temperature of serving wine cocktail and so on
ive been 3rd march the chef vito recommended us some fresh fish ricciola di mare  my god so tender delicious and he suggested a red wine as companion trust me the best marriage ever seen
then i got spaghetti cacio e pepe  they were very italian 
finally i have to say the quality the real italian style improved a lot

and this is a real quite place  this is not an overcrowed place full of tables and so on nice athmoshere if would like to talk and hear the others are sharing the dinner with u, we typically avoid italian restaurants in china but thought wed try prego since we were staying at the westin and it was long business day so glad we did the cuisine is very comfortable and the simplicity is what makes it so great the chefs are not trying too hard but everything felt italian authentic we enjoyed the minestrone soup and rucola salads to start with half portions of pasta along with sicilian white wine the table service was excellent with particular nod to peter we felt very taken care of in an intimate way at a large hotel, whilst staying in the hotel my wife and i decided to eat in after a very hectic day sight seeing on reflection really not a good choice

ok we arrived a little later for dinner than the chinese norm and maybe the chef was off for the evening but the food was a total disappointment somewhat akin to heavily influenced chinese italian fusion with my wifes pasta so spicy it my have well been a sichuan dish

only saving grace was the service and service recovery when we pointed out the shortfalls

maybe we just got an off night but it was the low point of an otherwise excellent weekend, business dinner in the hotel setting is nice for excellent food and great service easy in and out  wine list is great and prices are reasonable, only my second visit here but a good location for an excellent business lunch they have both a business menu with numerous quick options and of course an extensive a la carte menu thus time i opted for their generous menu with the icelandic cod being an absolute standout in subtle flavours with many winebytheglass options a great way to compliment all dishes well done, the food here is exceptional not cheap by shanghai standards everything is served perfectly and the staff are very helpful the managerowner is rather overbearing and the night we dined when he was off was relaxing and the most beautiful seafood prepared and plated perfectly with a beautiful flavour had the roast cod and was scrumptious would go here again expensive although you get what you pay for with food, came in for a lunch and had a nice meal i had a bowl of pasta with the marinara sauce and it was very good prices are what you would expect in a large western hotel chain but none the less it was a nice meal, my wife and i went to prego to try out a new italian restaurant

we ordered 2 glasses of wine which was very nice they had a good selection although many by the bottle

we ordered the minestrone soup caprese salad and margarita pizza all were very delicious and went very well with the wine

it was nice ambiance while eating dinner as the westin lobby band played up until 900pm

it was a little pricey but it was good quality food

also luciano the manager was very nice and pleasant to talk to he made us feel very welcome and thanked us for the business, the staff smoothly catered for both chinese and international guests by creating the perfect custom designed menu that everyone could enjoy together the modern room which has a private wine cellar creating a cozy feel made the guests felt at ease in the restaurant�s genuine italian atmosphere located in a prime spot the heart of shanghai with a private room for 2030 guests austen morris associates hosted one of many successful private investment seminars the chef designed a custom menu and portion size to ensure all guests got to try a bit of everything there is a reasonably priced highquality wine selection which all the guests enjoyed paired with their antipasto misto prego the second course lasagne al forno and main course which was a chargrilled australian 100 day grainfed beef tenderloin with risotto cake broccolini wild mushroom and port wine the entire management of the event was highly detail oriented which allowed the dining experience presentation and event as a whole to flow smoothly the service was definitely that would be expected from an international fivestar hotel even in china furthermore prego at the westin bund center will soon start its fourth year as a chi fan for charity restaurant sponsor donating 100 of a table for 10 to local charities, nice and quiet not crowded restaurant with ok food excellent for business lunch if wish to continue discussing while eating, we visited prego for a quick dinner on thursday night i really liked the interior service was impeccable we had salads pizzas and to my surprise they had a piedmont wine which i really like really satisfying visit, nice menu but the food is not italian more like asia fusion italian really poor red gravies and the price is outrageous but that is to be expected in a westin hotel

skip this place and go to goodfellas about 3 blocks away, it was my first trip to shanghai for work and the after a long flight i was delighted to feel so welcomed by luciano who is an excellent host he went above and beyond making me feel at home thursday aperitivo is not to be missed excellent food and free martini cocktail flow for a very convenient price the atmosphere is so friendly relaxed and professional at the same time it has been my point of reference for the whole stay and i will definitely go back again if i will find myself in shanghai in the future thank you luciano and the staff, always a pleasure to be at prego at every stay in the westin in shanghai we have one culinary experience which is one dinner at pregos we ask luciano to prepare a meal off menu must admit this is excellent  you can take your time no rush good service and ambiance last trip mid march 2015  he did it again the starter was artisanal  phenomenal the course excellent in taste and exactly balanced
thanks luciano and team 

best regards

the netherlands , the calamari was tender the pizzas were yummy and the gnocchi was great we ate twice during our stay, they have this awesome italian host who says mamma mia when bringing you your lunch fantastic food is just ok they have an amazing antipasto area  get that and skip the main course, we are in prego for a champagne dinner 24 people in the private dining room at the back end super service from team luciano and chef thomaswell created cooked  presented menu courses excellent cold seafood starter and a plate of duck several ways was superb lovingly made desserts ah yes and several bottles of taittinger, finally i found an italian restaurant that can service not only the best italian food but warm service the manager luciano is very friendly and considerate he asked and understood what we need and recommend the most suitable food all of these make me feel like i was in italy again in my opinionperhaps it is even better than many in italy

absolutely i will come again once i am in shanghai so i joined the spg club my membership is 52141220349 with which i will enjoy additional benefit, dined here recently for lunch and can say that the meals we chose had very authentic italian flavours the pasta was delicately prepared and the salads were fresh and tasty great selections of wines from most parts of the world also available the ambiance was soft and spacious although not very italian apart from some furnishings while service was quick and pleasant i dont know why we decided to eat italian in shanghai i guess it was conveniently located at the hotel we stayed in, when you are ready for a change in shanghai and want italian food plus a very good wine list stop by prego in the westin hotel in the bund enjoy good service from the staff francis was quite helpful and he speaks english and italian and the food was very good if luciano the manager is on premise ask him to stop by we ate risotto gnocchi with giant prawns and lasagna al forrno beautifully presented very tasty and the bread is homemade i dont think we have ever been in such a friendly place, the restaurant has a italian style it is very comfortable and represents an option for tourists hosted at the westin bund however the numbers of kind of pizzas are not so big each pizza serves 6 slices the waiters can speak english, prego restaurant at westin shanghai serves up some amazing italian food with flavours that pop in your mouth the manager luciano makes the dining experience feel friendly and very welcoming ive stayed at westin few times now and always look forward to lucianos welcome and surprise food off menu the personalised experience you get from luciano is well worth it, i habe been twice exciting atmosfere good and tasty food friendry staff and luciano the manager lovely and professional guy  i never eat a so tipycal good italian pasta in shanghai 
i will back for sure and i suggest to everibody ","Turkish cuisine",0.999816045417586
224,"this is a great place to visit at night vibrant  great atmosphere and really lovely but quality  the food is the usual mexican fair its fairly good but the beers  spirits shisha smoking pipes are great as is the music sitting outside is best  get there around 9 pm to get a seat though, if you want to get drunk with your friends dance and have a good time and dont mind loud music and inside smoking then this is the place for you it can be fun especially as last venue of the night but it feels quite touristy and personally reminded me of these beach bars in mallorca, was here for a drink with my babe the bar is very nice with varieties of drinks to accommodate each and every one i liked mojito cocktail its an open space so for this season dont forget to take your coat no need to worry about transport bse meter taxi are at the door, strongly recommended if you wanna go out with friends and you dont know where to go there are so many foreigns in this club you will enjoy so much for sure, what a lovely restaurant with a young man with amazing hospitality archie vellanueva managing the whole friday evening crowd efficiently the quality of food and drinks were equally good like the whole environment and the pub with an upstairs and open air restaurant, we put our coats in the dressroom never found them they didn t even pay back the money for the dress room, a good mix of easternwestern young and not that young with a cool atmosphere if you want to go dancing this is a good place with latin and commercial music it has also a good terrace to meet new people or chill with friends if you are looking for a posh place this is not the place but if you feel like just enjoying without being judged its definitely worth to give it a try, very cool and chill place with latin atmosphere on friday and saturday is complete full people can dance on the top bar counter its so fun
plus i met some cool people, drinks and food are excellenti took tacos one portion with chicken and another one with porkcocktails during happy hour are around 40 rmbduring weekend and holidays can be busy ladiesnight what they call it on mondays and wednesdays some stunt to attract more people on low weekdays , zapatas is a restaurant a lougne a bar and a night club
you find both local and foreign peoples
you can really have a good night such a party here 
and you also can have a drink on a nice terrasse with smooth music
no entry fees and the drinks costs are acceptable, for a mexican barpub it is a very nice place it is nothing fancy but for a mexican bite and a party vibe this is a good place it shares the same garden with sashas

on tuesdays from 1821 they have a all you can eat taco buffet for 88 rmb and you can add a free flow selected beer soft drink or margaritas for 50rmb i have not tried this buffet but it looks really nice

i tried the chimichanga with chicken i got some rice and some bean pure to it and 3 different dips for 65rmb a really good price for what was served they also have happy hour on the drinks which make the drinks even cheaper

for a shisha there is a individual guy walking around between the two restaurants, overall a very unpretentious place  they have a bar and dancing is encouraged  no special dress code and they have a large open area  porch  excellent for summer or to watch games they also serve food until late cocktails arent great better to stick to beer and they also serve free tequila d
why i say more of pubmexican bar and less of restaurant because sashas within same compound is a restaurant, we had a boys night here while in shanghai rolled up early looked dead but once you hit 11pm it went off great music shot girls on the bar everyone enjoying themselves  great night unbeknown to me i lost my passport there  i was literally at the passport office when the management rang to say they had my passport mad dash in a cab and yes had my passport back management would not accept cash or a kiss but they did get a big hug shows a great club which entertains but also cares about its patrons  you guys are the best , i do normally enjoy eating out in zapatas but our last experience wasnt the best between a lengthy wait for our food the meal bill arriving before we even had finished eating and hadnt requested it and drinks that were below par it wasnt the best night i could understand if the place was busy but it was empty except for one other couple, we didnt eat here but have been several times for drinks and dancing and hooka love this bar it plays great music drinks are reasonably priced and you can dance on the bar, i lived in nanjing for just over 2 years and visited shanghai at least once a month and every time we would go to zapatas on mondays it was mexican night which was great fun the food is great and for girls its free frozen daiquiris between 9pm and midnight it starts off with salsa music then its classic pop tunes its a great bar for westerners to hang out and a great place to meet other expats, this is a great bar visited by both western as chinese people
actually its 3 bars in one relatively quit bar inside on the 1st floor fantastic garden outside and a disco inside at ground level
disco is as to be expected women dancing on the bar etc etc
you can order sishas waterpipe with apple tabacco next to every kind of strong alcohol you desire
taxis are in front of the bar all night even at closing time which is at 0430
a great alternative for the much more expensieve barstreet, this place has it all  djs girls dancing and crazy drink specials highly recommended for a night out, first time for me here their are a lot of expats there
thats a good place to meet with friends enjoy some drinks and music, big terrace to drink good atmosphere
the food is not really good but i recommend this place for a drink andor party in the club, ok for some drinks with friends but the food is sad it is a landmark in the city and has been around for ever but is only worth a visit when the weather is nice and you want sit outside and drink margaritas eat elsewhere, zapatas is tagged with mexican pizza bbq and bar aside from bar it doesnt really do any of the others very well most nights however if you want a lively bar pretty good music have a decent boogie engage in some excellent people watching and leave at too late oclock then i would recommend a visit if you are a girl youll have to put up with being hiton pretty regularly usually i am sad to say from rather drunk foreigners who are there due to its reputation my wife and i are irregular visitors but always have a good time as we know why we are going and we know what to expect hint if you go around the major holiday periods you get a higher percentage of locals attending which usually makes for a slightly calmer evening, on tuesday nights this place has an all you can eat buffet its pretty limited but the food is fresh and tasty plus you can 50rmb for all you can eat drinks  including frozen margaritas

this makes it a fun night out, i went only from 0100 am to close and had such a dancing and funny night of course everything depend os the mood and company but if this is good then place if you look for the latest hits dancing and laugh with your friends or people there going up and down to the bars bar to dance while listening the latest pop and dancing hits you will definitely have a good night price drinks is ok and ambient full of western people mainly but also some asian ladies once per hour they play the tequila song where you can drink one shot no pay, there is nothing much mexican about this place except maybe the tequila but still good fun you can dance and drink a lot and prices are ok you can enjoy the terrace of the sasha anyway, nothing impressed
drink was pretty poor taste margarita martini
meal was ok
ambiance was good and staff was friendly, the food was ok nothing great but the portions were large the basic margharita was so so the more premium one with the upside down beer in it was much better, the bar is fun and they serve very tasteful pizzas outside there are many foreign people good atmosphere certainly recommend this place with those free tequila shots, mexican very good food soooo much food did not finish the chicken fajita great drinks mango margerita mojitos tequila and much more service good but we went there on a saturday for free flow margaritas and taco buffet but when we arrived they did not have that, i kinda became accustomed to going to this place for a drink and some good music but realized that being a person who lives in shanghai i think i outgrew this place good for travelers but ok just for me, im in shanghai for only two days and seriously this was the worst salsa night out ive ever had no problems happened but started with a dinner the quality of mexican food was no where close to being mexican at the same time it is over priced more than double what it should be

the staff was ok but then when me and my friend went to the inside area where everyone dances salsa and bachata they charged us 50rmb each to go into the dance area even though we had dinner there and even though my friend doesnt dance still charged the 50rmb
then the saddest part started around 30 guys and 5 or 6 girls and nothing called romance or connection or anything between the dancers was all mechanical a freak show everyone is just trying so hard to swing pull and push the girl and at the end to land her on his private part even though some girls tried to get out of it that didnt workthat was really a sad dance experience, good hang out place to meet non chinese people gives you chance to gyrate on loud music atmosphere is electrifying at times, if you miss home or miss chatting with your western friends then this place can help lots of westerners drinks comedy food outdoor seating rare in shanghai and fun people open to chatting with strangers check it out always something happening here, always started the evening here dont go there on friday and saturday because they will play the same music but possible that has changed watch out for the women of the night, small dance floor upstairs and downstairs good sound system to make an enjoyable evening great patio area outside when the crowd inside gets too intense always something fun going on, location is excellent just next to sashas popular and good for dancing i recommend for the night and bar hopping, you can have a really nice mexico food there
in summer you can sit outside in their beer garden they even have a bar outside

after 11pm disco starts in first floor with free tequila shots from the bar dancers
every wends day its girls night girls can get free margarita until 12pm

cocktail is around 55rmbcup beer price is around 50rmbglass

our favorite food there is quesadilla its one of the hot spots for foreigners in shanghai, went to taco tuesday at this fun mexican restaurant all you can eat fajitas  not in fact tacos but nevertheless amazing selection of fillings only thing missing was guacamole but i was promised this would be rectified on my next visit fun atmosphere mainly for the young returned on halloween and couldnt move for people mostly westerners in the most amazing array of costumes i have ever seen wall to wall people and loud disco music very much for the international set, first and the most important  tequila is fake especially in club bar secondthat place is look ing cozy but it became a station for prostitue for european people there is no much option in that area except hollywood but it is also small, bars and restaurants in one place with standard mexican favourites the outdoor setting was a plus easy to get to on the metro but the front door is hard to find go to the street corner and enter there, this is the place to be on mondays nights free beer for the guys for an hour and free margaritas for women for 5 hours free tequilla shots all night every hour you have to go in with an open mindof course the free alcohol is cheap but its free rare in the big city the interior always has upbeat music playing that you can dance to you can dance on the bar as well there are interior and exterior bars and a beer garden you can smoke hookah in the garden there is a sit down dining room as well as a snack shack that stays open 11 pm to 2 am food is good, i live in the former french concession area of shanghai its know for its bars and restaurants zapatas is a 2 minute walk from my apartment the staff is the best and they will quickly become your friends

the craziness doesnt start until about 11pm and goes until 6 am every hour gorgeous chinese girls in short shorts cowboy bootshats get on the bar and dance and pour free tequila shots in everyones mouth that approaches the bar

only word of caution is watch out for the hookers unless you are wanting that  and a gift that keeps on giving they are persistent and will leave you alone if you say no just know that there are single ladies and there are hookers youll learn to tell the difference in the way they look at you and approachlol

enjoy, wed ladies night is a blast and very popular the place is famous for its latin style but these years it just gets weirder and weirder full of creepy old men plus the dj never changed songs i get bored quickly, if you want to have celebration atmosphere great musicmeet a lot of positive peoplefeel yourself younger and dance all night and next morning be happily tired  zapatas will be the best next time in shanghai 100 i will come there tekila time, zapatas is an excellent place for people from western world  the place has a global feel  most of teh people are expats and tourists

the food  drinks are good and reasonable  moreover the place has a very safe feel 

every one hour after 1130  you get free tequilaa , i never go for food but drinking and dancing around sometimes late at night it is a fun place and you can meet relaxed party going locals and expats enjoying a bit too many drinks and jumping around
the music is not the best the drinks normal priced are nothing to write home about but the atmosphere is usually good
beware there are plenty of professionals hanging around in and around the bar, on monday night this is the perfect place to start your clubbing trip ladies night with free margaritas and free flow of beers for one hour from 10pm to 11pm

in addiction if you want to taste some quite good mexican food on tuesday night for just 88rmb you will have an allyoucaneat buffet remember to get in before 9pm otherwise you are no more allowed to have the special price

then during the night zapatas will change from a pub and restaurant into a night club and the ground are will be full of music drinks and people dancing

the outdoor space is very cool in particular in warm season the perfect place to chill with old and new friends, if u wanted to grab some drinks this is the place to go its more of a dive bar irish pub feel so its not really high class the price is good though, great outdoor space but the drinks are quite expensive for just catching up with friends
the bar turns into a club at night and has regular ladies nights, sitting outside in the garden of zapatas a hip restaurantclub in the french concession having dinner and many drinks made us feel like heaven after that we went inside to zapatas lounge to party in the club very good danceable music by the way","dumpling restaurant",0.661551515266814
226,"food this is a highend french dining experience it is not a bistro they offer alacarte but you can choose a menu of 46 dishes and choose from the alacarte menu at set prices 4 dishes was around 800 yuan + beverages we ordered the foie gras with truffles recommended for entre and the merino lamb highly recommended for main their souffle is great too a high point was their bread service  3 unique housebaked breads spread out throughout your meal

service faultless service my girlfriend had a sore throat and asked for a hot water with a few slices of ginger in it  the service staff obliged and continue to fill her cup throughout the night this is an example of their overall keen attentiveness and pleasant demeanour, amazing restaurant with great food and very attentive service the entire hotel is very very posh sir ellys is no exception the restaurant was surprisingly empty on a friday night probably the corrupt officials are not entertain so much these days the views are fantastic same as the atmosphere and the food we had an amazing wagyu tomahawk that was cooked to perfection the shrimp carpaccio was also very good only the wine was not living up to his fame and we were till the end not sure if it was genuine or a creative chinese remix, my friend and i were traveling to shanghai for a leisure trip in december
we went to the sir ellys terrace on the last day of our stay for drink it was amazing we actually regretted why didnt we find out it earlier

the location couldnt be more perfect the rooftop bar offers many amazing night views with the century skyscrapers on the pudong side the fantastic view along south river also flanked by the classic elegance of the 1920<u+2032>s bund precinct buildings i thought i was falling love with the mix of fascinating historic building and modern architecture

the service was also impeccable the staff couldnt have been friendlier by the time my friend and i arrived at the 14th floor cherry served us stunningly

we heard the rooftop bar is currently under construction and it will be finished before april hope the renovation is going well we are looking forward to returning to sir ellys terrace, ellys restaurant made my birthday lunch special the food was sumptuous but the king crab cannelloni was outstanding there was a variety of accompanying bread rolls but the bacon ones are worth looking out for despite me not wanting a birthday cake the chef made my dessert extra special by presenting it wit a happy birthday plaque made of chocolate staff were attentive but not intrusive, we went for a meal at sir ellys to celebrate my wifes birthday with my family in august 2015 sadly we had an inside table but still were able to enjoy the spectacular views of the pudong riverside

right from entry the service was excellent well trained friendly staff took care of us the sommelier put me on to some excellent chinese wine the food was exquisite three of us had the tasting menu and each course was a delight the black cod was particularly memorable

my only complaint and im really digging deep here is that the staff need a brush up on silver service occasionally they would serve or clear from the wrong side but im being super pedantic in that complaint the service itself was friendly overall and unobtrusive when required

we finished the night by going up to the roof top terrace for a final drink given they served brilliant non alcoholic cocktails and kept the popcorn coming in limitless supply my kids were very happy i actually tipped the dj as she ran a clever set of modern takes on classics that was a perfect mood setting as we watched out of the busy river and pudong skyline

though your wallet will notice the visit the food ambiance and service more than compensates, great views interesting crowd and a gin cocktail list that goes long just stop by for the 7pm lighting of the financial center every eveninggreat spot, the views the service and the feeling was so great that we had drinks twice in the outdoor terrace when we were in shanghai

perfect for a predinner cocktail or drinks to see shanghai light up, this was our first visit to sir ellys walking through sir ellys lounge on the 13th floor into the restaurant there is a fantastic panoramic view of the bund in three directions the seating staff are very cordial and professional the environment in the restaurant is quiet for conversation with soft music and enough distance between tables for privacy the cuisine is a frenchasian fusion served western style the food is truly outstanding which is accompanied by its price we opted for a six course tasting menu to try a variety of the chefs creations from a fois gras appetizer an oyster appetizer through consomme fish and meat entrees and a dessert creation all of the food was a gourmet delight very well done by the chef the wait staff was attentive knowledgeable and helpful this is fine dining with small portions individually prepared and served correctly which allows for conversation between courses the wine list was excellent both by the glass and the bottle
for a pleasant evening after dinner in the restaurant enjoy a drink and the marvelous view in the lounge, we went to sir ellis for just some drinks at the terrace the terrace has stunning views amazing to the pudong area and luckily we got the best table at the terrace with a magnificent view but then since it was getting late for dinner we decided to try their restaurant one flooor below we hadnt read any reviews so we tried our luck to say that we were not disappointed is an absolute understatement it was absolutely amazing we had the foie gras for appetizer and for main course i had the veal with truffle and foie gras sauce absolutely unforgettable service was also great even if it was a bit late in the evening, sir ellys terrace is an upscale contemporary rooftop bar and lounge the views of the pudong skyline are stunning and are arguably the best in shanghai the drinks are pricey but fantastic service was great a fantastic venue for late night drinks, i will be honest i went here for the best views of the bund and to enjoy a drink with a friend before hitting the nightlife overall the views were absolutely impeccable but the bartenders definitely need more training in both service and crafting expert drinks at a five star level do not go here for an expertly made manhattan or martini recommend scotch on the rocks or something they cant mess up alas i will continue taking guests here and look forward to seeing improvement, magnificent rooftop views across the bund 3 staff standing in the corner having a nice chinese chat about ladies whilst we sat and waited for them to amble over we finally got served unlike the poor guy next to us who was waving frantically to try and get his bill very poor bar snacks of dried out popcorn sweet nuts and tasteless olives a very good craggy range sauvignon blanc was a hefty 23 us a glass and was not that cool if you like to pretend you are rich and famous and want to get a taste of the usual arrogant shanghai service then please come here but if you want to know what a real peninsula hotel is like then go to bangkok which is where they should send their staff, visited the rooftop terrace with friends for late night drinks really enjoyed the spectacular view of the river and skyline behind the river perfect service, really nice restaurant and excellent service we were a little nervous about trying some of the local restaurants and probably very unjustifiably however we felt very confident of the hygiene in the peninsula hotel, spectacular roof top view that is hard to beat just make sure you check that weather forecast for day before you make the reservations popped in to the roof top bar for wine before we had dinner below note that children are not allowed past 9pm at the rooftop bar
food at the restaurant was good as expected service was very good as well but be prepared for pay for the dinner with the view had the table next to the window but nothing beats the view from the bar, the peninsula rooftop will not let you down their terrace was amazing overlooking the bund and shanghais modern landmark buildings the drinks were innovative and tasty it was really worth going and my favorite experience in the city there were plenty of staff members who made guest feel very welcomed, perfect spot to view shanghai and the amazing lights at nightthey provide pashminas if you are cold and you can order delicious finger food with your drinks, this is one of the fewest real fine dining restaurant in shanghai is it pricey yes is the portions smallyes so if you do not want to damage your wallet and just fill up your stomach and complain that here is expensive just stay awayhere is about quality not quantity, this is a great restaurantexcellent food and service while
ambiance is out of this world came to dinner near closing  after
just arriving at hotel and staff was most gracious in serving us
and keeping restaurant open till we finished long meal including
desert, by 11pm the lights on bith sides of huangpu river are going to switch off

make sure you go by the evening to secure a corner table for the best view

standard cocktail are reasonably priced given the great view expect around 100rmb average for a cocktail, try their chef tasting menu over a bottle of shiraz wine hong kong manager is nice but rest waiters need some knowledge about their wines over 1500 per person worth for view only but not that worth for food, we enjoyed a drink and casual food on the roof of the hotel overlooking the river my martini was perfect and the accompanying finger food delicious this is a lively western style bar attached to the restaurant the service was impeccable, starting with the terrace the view is superb and as one can sit there just for the price of one drink it is a bargain even at peninsula prices in fact we had a light supper on the terrace on one evening being looked after by the charming olivia and having just what we wanted on that occasion

to mark what was nearly the end of our holiday we had dinner in the main restaurant which was superb the rack of lamb almost melted in my mouth the hong kong maitre d runs everything tightly but subtly

no it wasnt cheap but food wine and service of this quality arent usually cheap, just let me pass you through our night

so we got up in the lobby and there was no hostess so after waiting for 2 minutes i walked in and asked a girl she looked for our reservation but couldnt find it while it was just confirmed by the lobby in the peninsula she didnt say this though so she wanted to seat us in the rather empty hotel though we had a window seat this is why im pretty certain why they didnt have our reservation because there were no seats left near windows after 5 minutes a table came free so were were put there at a rather wonkey table when my friends came in again no sign that they actually had our reservation and it wasnt till he mentioned my appearance that they made the connection the floor guys are messy and will ask repeated questions the main guy i think from hong kong was excellent though friendly and helpful guy but they should get more of him

the food was amazing though we had a paella mind you tiny but great its a modern twist oysters and another dish all nice attention to detail and the taste was amazing mind you we like to share but these dishes really dont lend well for it the main course waygu 9+ grade steak was amazing cook to perfection nicely presented by the hong kong guy next to the table exquisite sauces just wow

their wine list while large and some impressive wines are a bit oddly priced a sicilia vega which retails here for 4 to 5k sells in the restaurant for a little over 5k a rvc which is roughly 25k goes for absurd 80k also while extensive a lot isnt what you would call the obvious choice

the end was a small oddity they couldnt cut fapiaos i eat in a lit of places and this is the first time ever i hear this

all in all the food was amazing but for a restaurant and hotel of such stature the service was an extreme letdown except for the hong kong guy, last months has been there with my husband we ordered 780rmbaround this pricecant remember clearly set menu to be honest cant used to their sea food that much its too fresh keep the orginal tastewhiout any sauce to cover the fishlike smellbut maybe that s the frunch cunsine like their beef steak ver much the meat is very soft and tastey it just melted in ur mouth super deleciousand their dessert is very nice as wellthe name is sufula i think service no need to mention just excellent, visited restaurant for dinner we had a lovely table by the window so we can enjoy the shanghai skyline

we went for three courses which was delicious i would recommend this venue for a special dinner with the backdrop of the skyline, i was looking forward to my dinner in sir ellys as it had been on my list for a very long time when i arrived nobody bothered to take my winter coat so i had to throw it on one of the chairs in the lounge where we were having a predinner cocktail when we were asked to move into the restaurant i had to take my coat with me and had to ask if somebody could place it in the cloakroom the restaurant looks immaculate as can be expected from a venue like this decor is tasteful and the high ceiling impressive had an excellent fish carpaccio appetizer but the rack of lamb i selected from the menu was not available instead we were recommended the lamb shoulder minimum two persons which when it arrived was sliced at the table and accompanied by mixed vegetables the meat portion was huge whilst the vegetable portion was minute the sauce dried up on the plate shortly after the dish was served and we had to eat the dry meat by itself my partner and i were disappointed and had expected a lot better from a restaurant of this caliber and in this pricerange sir ellys is expensive we finished our excellent craggy range sauvignon blanc at the bar and settled the bill when we wanted to leave there was nobody at the hostess desk to farewell us and i had to walk back to the restaurant to get somebodys attention and assistance to retrieve my coat from the cloakroom all in all an expensive disappointing experience and a restaurant concept that with its table service is no longer of this day and age, its definitely the most awesome place if you want to view the shanghai skyline in style while sipping on a delicious cocktail the drinks are a bit o the expensive side but not surprising as it is an elite terrace bar on the top floor of the peninsula hotel, we stopped here for the great view but on a chilly and windy october night decided to drink and eat inside sliders were nice but the service was ridiculously slow the waitress first brought coasters a few at a time we had a group of about 8 took orders and food and wine orders came dribbling out one at a time over a long period a pleasant experience despite the slow service, forget about the bar rouge and other rooftop places along the bund instead come here for your shanghai skyline evening drinks but do not tell everyone because soon this place will be crowded too

a bit more expensive than bar rouge but offers way better views with both the pudong and the bund visible and does not gather the ridiculous crowd and pumping music in fact not crowded at all small coffee tables only people are not allowed to stand and linger around the terrace if the tables are full the place is full

extra kudos came from having those gas warmers around the rooftop terrace warmed up our autumn night nicely

come early so you can still get a table especially the pudongbund side terrace fills quickly expect to pay 100rmb for drinks + 10 service charge they also serve snacks tapas oysters and all that stuff what goes well with your drinks i did not have taste of these but at least they looked good on the menu and on other peoples tables, if you want the quintessential shanghai skyline view skip the sky high observation decks on the pudong side of the city and instead head to sir ellys terrace in the peninsula hotel the beautiful open air space offers a 270 degree view of shanghai including an incredible vista across the river the view is even better at night with the skyscrapers fully lit up make sure to come before 1000pm when many of the lights are turned off there are heat lamps to take the edge off cool fall evenings the food and drinks are pretty good too for a change from local cuisine go for the beef sliders and the cheese plate, i was at sir ellys in october 2014 i ordered caviar foigra oysters and pigeon all was good
there are not many places where you can have black caviar and the only lace where you eat pigeon
restaurant stuff are really nice and helpful my friend who is strict vegetarian didnt find anything what he would eat in menu and they offered mushroom risotto and salad which wasnt in menu all was very delicious
we will definitely come again, bring your wallet to for the overpriced cocktails and acceptable food for one of the most romantic bar experiences to be had anywhere in the world

be prepared for sticker shock but the lasting memory will soften the blow, visited sir ellys last week with friends while staying in shanghai for a holiday we arrived after dinner elsewhere and unfortunately the lights on all the buildings we could see from the bar didnt stay on for too long they go off at about 10 pm so would recommend going earlier to enjoy the view

service was very slow and the cocktail list could do with an update as its quite limited and uninspiring it was really cold that night and we were not dressed warmly enough we asked a waiter for a gas burner that was not being used to be brought closer to our table and the table next to us as those guests were also feeling the cold that took quite some time to happen after they had attended to many other things first

the staff service could be improved to match the impressive location, other than the impressive huangpu river view that wows the diners there is nothing much else to rave about this restaurant food was ordinary service was below par
there are many better european restaurants than this one in shanghai, spectacular views of the river activity and the pudong skyline the martinis are excellent if that is your poison of choice, amazing bar at the rooftop of the peninsula shanghai hotel one of the best view from the bund
a lot of taste single malt whiskey too , probably the best rooftop bar in shanghai in terms of view
drink varieties are good tried peninsulas house wines and theyre not bad cocktails are also not bad

the only thing is the barely there service it took ages to take our order and even longer for the bill staff also seems to have limited knowledge on the menu, my new favourite place in shanghai sir ellys terrace at the elegant peninsula hotel offers stunning openair views over the bund puxi and the famous pudong skyline its only on the 14th floor so low cloud wont affect it like some other openair  rooftop restaurants around town the restaurant is inside downstairs but it is possible to dine well from the bar menu on the terrace the staff are mostly pleasant and the standard of english is good enough naturally such a location atop such a hotel means the prices are equivalent to any major city so this is not for anyone on a budget it gets pretty busy just before sundown so arrive around 5pm to ensure a good seat, this restaurant is beautiful located inside of the peninsula hotel in shanghai on the bund the cocktails before dinner were on their rooftop bar the bar sported the best view ive ever seen but the cocktails were very weak and expensive a must do in shanghai dinner was very good and different my wife had the cod which was excellent and i had a new york strip steak which i thought was a little tough but tasty however the view and upscale ambiance make up for anything that could be a little off highly recommend, loved the view and the decor of the restaurant the bread was fresh and delicious my only comment on the fish is that it could have been a bit fresher still good though, we had a wonderful anniversary dinner at this restaurant we appreciate their thoughtfulness by placing rose pedals on the table forming a heart shape their sommelier jean claude has a very vast knowledge on wines we had a very good steak perfectly cooked at our preference  their oysters were very fresh and the caviar from china was so good it was such a memorable evening, two couples went to sit outside on the terrace under a heater but with incredible views along the bund across to pudong and down and up the river we drank cocktails which were well presented and came with nuts and popcorn to help soak up the alcohol

service from unobtrusive staff was good and the highlight for me was the lift up to the 14th floor terrace a classic art deco lift in what is a traditionally built modern hotel

yes the cocktails were expensive but we were sitting out in november and appreciating the views in a relaxing comfortable setting, yes a lovely looking restaurant with its art deco style and views along the bund  as it should be for the peninsula however you can get equally arresting views and equally nice if not better food and service with less of a sting from m on the bund or new heights at 3 on the bund
we went to sir ellys for a business dinner and it was very disappointing the service was probably the height of our annoyance the waiters were surly and the first spilled red wine on the tablecloth and my side plate first pour completely ignored it
the beetroot salads had two quarters of one beetroot in them both seriously a beetroot salad folks another guest and i had the consomme however they forgot to bring us soup spoons waiting waiting we finally had to holler for a waiter to get soup spoons 3 of us had the lamb loin and disappointingly it was a bit dry and tasteless for near $50 incl the 15 surcharge a plate very disappointing the wines were seemingly grossly overpriced as was the table water which you have no choice about or so it seemed
at the end of the main meals we sat for ages and noone attended to us dessert coffee perhaps no in the end we again had to attract the attention of the happy chappies its no wonder they are unhappy seeing what silly people like us pay for such food probably their weeks wages
afterwards we headed for the bar by now a stinking cigarettesmoke filled area that i simply could not stand for one minute lest we passively smoked thru a pack of cigarettes surprising for the peninsula i nay we were not impressed at all this dinner should have been an unforgettable experience well it was an unforgettable experience wont be going back nor recommending it for dinner at any rate, roof terrace bars are spectacular at any venue along the bund but this one not only offers a milliondollar view of pudong and the bund it also caters to a quieter crowd and lets one have a relaxed moment taking it all in my first visit to shanghai dates back to 1983 and so i always marvel the great changes that have come to pass in this great city sir ellys offers a great selection of cocktails and whiskey in the true peninsula fashion i love their hotels and will always make it a point in visiting their exclusive fb venues sir ellys can compete with the best in hong kong new york or tokyo highly recommended, great view of the financial district on rooftop bar away from the crowds on the streets

drinks are expensive though <u+00a5>60 for cheapest bottle beer plus 15 service

they should also have a policy of stopping people going up just for the view as when youve paid that much to enjoy a drink and a view its pretty annoying people climbing all over you to take photostraipsing through the bar

shame as ruins a great spot, sir ellys terrace on the top of the peninsula hotel on the bund has a great view of the bund as youd expect from the peninsula hotel it aint cheap we paid about 210 rmb for two cocktails, there was a spanish night in sir ellys i dont know if they do that often or if it was a single occasion

we have waited around 1 hour until our starters arrived which is inappropriate
waiter spilled some wine food was ok but nothing to write home about
if it wasnt for the amazing decoration and design of the restaurant i would give a bad rating, had two business meetings here both in the afternoon its a good quiet spot to talk over teacoffeedrinks and small bites, drinks were ok but not a lot of alcohol the scenery outside made the experience vs the bartenders abilities
dinner on the other hand was amazing had waygu beef and fish beef was perfect and my wife said the black cod was the best fish she has ever had

227,"following a recommendation from a friend we tried this place as we had never experienced japanese cuisine other than sushi wow were we impressed professional attentive service from the start and an excellent range of food they have three set menus at different price points the cheapest being around 400 rmb and the most expensive around 900 rmb we opted for the middle option at around 550 rmb and were treated to an 89 course tasting menu that would hold up to michelin star restaurants in the uk it really is that good from fresh sashimi to wagyu steak to fruity creamy custard it is really excellent food it doesnt seem to be mentioned in many good food guides and is located through a courtyard quite far back from the road so it is very much a hidden vastly underrated gem try it for yourself, we stumbled upon this amazing japanese restaurant thanks to smart shanghai it is set in a nice location in the french concession and you might not see it without specifically searching for it it is set in a villa and has a huge atmospheric outside area in an open space conservatory with lots of candlelight the staff was very friendly and helpful and it felt like being on holiday in a 5 star hotel we went for the cheapest set menu about 380 rmb per person as we just couldnt decide with all these delicious options and absolutely loved the food it included sashimi oysters prawns and lots of other seafood and japanese fine dining dishes that we havent tried before the drinks were also reasonably priced with a glass of wine or beer from 48 rmb the bathrooms are like in the ritzcarlton seat heating lots of toiletries very clean we loved it at shari and lots of my friends have already asked me where to find this place after they saw our photos of the food cant wait to come back, had an excellent dinner at the shari a victorian style bunglow converted into a chic eatery in downtown shanghai the place is elegant cosy and the staff really friendly the food menu is extensive and the servings absolutely fresh the sushi and the shashimi are very standard and so is the selection of drinks and beverages the restaurant has both outdoor and indoor seating options and is highly recommended for a romantic candle lit dinner with friends or family alike, what a great place we went for the summer free flow and then stayed the rest of the day it was really fun a really good atmosphere  good food good drink  good music and dancing it was like being at a wedding party it was really a friendly atmosphere i really liked this place for a afternoon and evening out highly recommend, located in shanghai french concession near hengshan subway station ive driven in front of several times and always wanted to give it a try finally with my spouse we went there for a romantic dinner restaurant is in an old manor and we got a table in the garden atmosphere was very nice japanese food tasted good but nothing special we are usually patient but service was quite slow it is also pricey in shanghai you can find better japanese restaurants but not as nice, set in a hertitage house with indoor outdoor and glass house seating
service was good food was nicely presented but taste was mediocre
we three ordered set lunch at 299 rmb per pax according to the local dianping website + extra tempura which could buy us an excellent dinner at the bund for same price
taste of pork in curry hot pot was very odd
will not return, visited there for dinner
very light very tastefully presented service could be more engaging but no regrets food sort of made up for that
very artistically presented
enjoyed my evening, beautiful restaurant set in an old colonial building grounds the sashimi was very fresh and probably the best i have eaten in shanghai if you are a japanese food fan then this place is a must try the only negative point would be that the service was quite slow, i went to have a dinner last week end we had seat outside they have huge terrace which is so beautiful every dishes looked like so beautiful and delicious particularly beef steak perfect medium rare and garlic soy sauce is superb service was attentive and friendly i must come back to shari soon  perfect , i was looking for a sushi place with good reviews nearby my apartment and shari was the selected place i arrived as a solo diner and they accommodated me inside of the big house menu is not super extensive but has a couple of different options than your standard sushi places eg the shari rice which i didnt order but most of the tables around me did i had the salmon sashimi the prawn tempura and a roll and came out very satisfied the best part of the night was the roll it was made with special care i have to say

would come back only remark would be the price for 4 dishes including dessert and a asahi price was about 280 rmb almost 50 usd but for a date or a night of splurge and not too far from home is ok, shari is tucked away in a private villa on yongjia lu theres 2 sitting option either in the villa with 2 floors or on the garden with both sheltered or open air sitting the menu covers the usual offering of sushi and sashimi but its a modern japanese restaurant that gets creative with very good quality and creativitybeen there for both lunch and dinner was surprised to find that the lunch set menu is very good value
they coop with the folks from enoteca and theres a great bar next door highly enjoyable with family friends or even a date night, really good japanese food served in a stylish way with very good service traditional mix of many small dishes with excellent quality very nice atmospere as well, we decided to not go with the set menu we ordered sashimi and sushi it was fresh and the sashimi was one of the best we have had in shanghai we spend a whole night with friends in the garden it was relaxing and nice, delicious japanese food in a garden setting host greeted and seated us with a warm welcome
indoor seating is also very nice we chose to sit on the terrace outside efficient service and pleasant staff, went to shari with a group of 10 for a going away party my wife is pregnant so we ordered what we thought was a shabu shabu style hot pot instead of sushi with the rest of the group after the rest of our friends sushi beef tempura etc had all come we were still waiting for our hot pot we repeatedly asked the server when our food would arrive and were repeatedly told very soon after 52 minutes of waiting we were given a pot of just mushrooms with 6 pork meatballs with cartilage inside them price 198rmb 30+usd this pot of sadness and disappointment could have been prepared in literally 14 seconds but somehow took the geniuses in the shari kitchen 52 minutes never again shari there so many other options for japanese food in shanghai choose another restaurant, great atmosphere and great food
this is one of the best venues for japanese food in shanghai

ive been at shari in spring 2013 and i tried the 300rmb set menu it is a progression of surprising taste experiences rooted to japan but definitely unusual

located in the concession it is a beautiful villa candle light silent classy and romantic

impressive, located in the former french concession area this restaurant is part of a japanese chain that specializes in japanese food with a designer touch on the expensive side for shanghai but competitive for japanese food in tokyo my japanese wife raved about the rice the small dishes the presentation and the atmosphere i liked the old english house that was built in the late 1900s and was at its heyday during the 1920s with a very nice garden area that is used for bbq parties and large groups the japanse manager tomo utsubogo from kobe was very friendly to us and wanted to make sure that we were happy with everything service was attentive and they have some nice set menus make sure that you make room for the nice rice dish toward the end of the set menu set menus are $45  $75 per person and with drinks expect to spend up to $100 per person but there were many families with kids eating around us at 6pm on sunday, i love sushi and this was amazing food service and atmosphere my fiance suggested it having heard good things add one more to the reasons i love her everything was great and menu took a lot of choosing the atmosphere was great service amongst best in shanghai salmon tartare is a must try not cheap but definitely worth it toilets didnt match the standards elsewhere get a discount by downloading the wowvip app for food offers useful traveller tip for shanghai no affiliation promise like sushi and japanese food make this a stop, wanted to goto garlic but they had an event and we found shari just a few mins walk away

it was a tuesday night so it was not too busy it is a big place with a large outdoor terrace and 2 levels indoors

service was good but am not sure how they would cope if they were full waitstaff spoke great english helpful and provided great recommendations

the food was very good and we had multiple rolls apetizers and the recommendations of the day

228,"this restaurant probably has very good italian food and the place is very cozy and comfortable to eat at, have been to many of their outlets in town they serve decentlypriced italian food in grand gateway most restaurants are usually very expensive so if like me you do not like overpriced restaurants this place is for you quality of the food is quite ok overall, i ate there many times usually i dont like eat italian food outside of my country but my boss told me to try it and i had to 
the food is cooked in real italian style and the tasty is also very good
pasta cooked as we italian people like al dente
pizza also good quality
the service is a little slow but in general it is a good place to have a lunch or dinner in italian style, i was in pizza express 3 times for lunch im surprised by really tasty pasta pepperoni pizza san remo salad and the best tiramisu in china  pizza dough was so thin and very good also there is an olive bottle on the each table so you can use it if you like prices are not high recommended for families with children, i came here with my children one evening for a meal the waiters spoke very good english which was helpful as my mandarin is not that good the food has some of the usual pizza express favourites but also some local variations my son had a peking duck pizza by local standards this restaurant is not that cheap but the food was good and we went away happy, lunch on a weekday was super busy and the ratio of service to demand was skewed in the favor of playwithyoursmartphonewhileyouwait rather than attentive timely service

this is a busy spot of shanghai and descending into the open amphitheatreesque pit towards the apple store and pizza express puts you in a gladiatorial bout with time

the parma pizza with prosciutto was really tasty and fit with the restaurants cool backstory a londoner who in the 1960s opened the first restaurant in soho after being frustrated at not being able to find quality italian pizza

today according to the menu the pizzadoros or pizza chefs undergo 12 hours worth of training to really grasp the italian flair and art of pizza making if you get the right seat you can watch them toss fire and bake up pizza pies in the open kitchen

if youre in a rush for lunch in this part of shanghai avoid this place

but if you have time to spare there are pizzadoros just waiting for you to join the company of a hungry rapt audience, this is a review for the pizza express located in level 2 of the hongyi plaza in shanghai
the service was great we ate by the window overlooking the busy shopping street the ingredients were very fresh and there were quite a variety of pizzas from which to chose we were told one pizza would not be enough for two persons so we ordered two pizzas but   one would be plenty for two unless you were starving if you crave pizza while in china i cant imagine a better place to eat prices were very comparable to what you pay in the states two pizzas and three beers were about $40, this is a good pizza express with friendly attentive staff and fairly quick service the soup and pizza meal deal was a reasonable price and the food was tasty a decent place to go for pizza, of course  whats good is relevant but for being a pizzeria in shanghai this was excellent the staff is very friendly and the terrace in the back is really nice highly recommended if you have craving for pizza whilst in shanghai, pizza is not as good as london version but still a nice break if you tire of local cuisine around $20 per person restaurant is well decorated and very clean staff spoke enough english to easily get through the ordering process, great restaurant  great pizza  great pasta good place for families with kids i been to so many pizza express around the world and they never fail  reasonable prices , on our first night in shanghai we decided to visit pizza express the crust is crispy thin and the toppings are fresh and delicious the fresh basil on the pizza was an excellent add

the service was quick and friendly food was delivered hot and quickly

wine and beer available

the entire restaurant was very clean and organized

i say go for a slice, i really would like to give this restaurant five stars and if the food was all that mattered i would

im from the midwest usa and used to live in new york and have traveled extensively in italy i know good pizza the pizza at pizza express is fine nothing extraordinary its frequently dry and its not served hot its served quickly and the kitchen is open giving the place the semblance of propriety and efficiency i just wish the pizza was 50 better then it would match the exorbitant price$18 to $25 usd per 11 inch pie

plus the food is not all that matters at a restaurant the management matters too

this is where this restaurant gets dinged bigtime if you want to use a nonchinese credit or debit card the waitstaff will apply something called dynamic currency conversion dcc to your check lets say you are coming from the usa and paying in usd regardless of whether you press the button for cny or usd on the card reader the check will be registered in usd at an exchange rate that robs you of 5 of the check and pays it directly to the restaurant

yes the restaurant robs you of 5 of your check without your permission

this is not the fault of the waitstaff circumventing the card readers default to dcc is extremely difficult to do this is the fault of the restaurant managers and owners who accepted card readers with dcc knowing full well that theyd be stealing from their customers

if you think im exaggerating im not when i disputed three separate charges at the restaurant with my credit card company i was refunded the 5 in question in the dispute settlement the restaurant knows this is criminal chase amex and mastercard know this is criminal now you know this is criminal pay in cash or with unionpay, it was nice to be able to eat a pizza after a week of chinese food only the pizza was delicious and the staff very nice and friendly and very affordable, i found pizza express in shanghai very spacious since we were on a business trip to shanghai and one of our team members is a vegetarian our hosts took us to pizza express for lunch on more than one occasion there is a variety of food to choose from the grand chicken caesar salad is recommended pomodoro pesto is good we liked the local beer tsing tao

the service was quick and always with a smile enjoyed my food good experience, great pizza great atmosphere and great service they have a very neat place to see food was very good we ordered a large pizza and a house salad it was plenty for the four of us to share the only draw back to it is it is very noisy but i think all restaurants in china all like this so other that it is a great place to eat in shanghai, if you are traveling in china doing business or vacations you will find your self sometimes you need find a restaurant where find just a good pasta dish pizza or something you feel familiar with this is that place excellent pizza pasta and service highly recomended, not quite as good as their uk or hong kong branches for taste but decent nonetheless service was good too and conveniently open all afternoon, casual restaurant with good quality pizzas pizza variety is great  service is good appetizers  salads are also very good recommended is the pizza reggina and trufolata, we ate here several times during late june and july we enjoyed all of our dishes from the pizzas pastasalads and desserts a good break from chinese food for western travelers looking to have a couple of meals without msg great middle of the road option, we were surprised to have pretty good pizza in shanghai this restaurant was located within the ritz carlton hotel complex very convenient and much less expensive than the hotel food, very nice pizza restaurant in nanjing road street pizza was delicious and soup as well stuffs were helpful they have internet coverage which you have to sign in by china gsm line they also helped me to get my code with their cell phones thanks a lot order a hot soup enjoy your pizza while searching web and finish it with desert coffee is free for you, on a recent work trip i spotted pizza express and having a craving for pasta this was a stroke of luck having eaten in this chain in the uk i wasnt sure what to expect in china but i was pleasantly surprised food was consistent with what i have had in the uk and service was excellent we had some sharing starters and a mixture of pizza and pasta for mains their villa maria marlborough sauvignon blanc on the menu was lovely it had a lovely relaxed but quite lively atmosphere which was just what we wanted you could go here as a couple or a group of friends, went to the outlet in xiantiandi and it was very pleasant  a great rocket salad with nice cuts of italian ham plus the pizza was the very authentic great service too, my friend and i came here to celebrate our first month in china the meaty pizza and truffle pasta we ordered were both great it helped that their chief waiter spoke perfect english and was very attentive to our needs highly recommended for big groups and those who want to enjoy good food at an affordable price specially in an area like east nanjing, after a long day of apartment hunting we happen to look at a place in a neighborhood across the street from the center that this pizza express was in i had never heard of this restaurant before and in all my life never knew of a pizza restaurant with the word express in the name to be anything more than casual dining
well after browsing the menu we were pretty surprised by the prices for such small pizzaspasta portions but being 9 pm and having 3 hungry children to feed we went for it and tried to carefully construct a dinner that could fulfill us and not go overboard on the bill we did the best we could and after 2 cheese pizzas which are meant for one hungry person not really two people unless youre having a light lunch a pasta dish and a kids meal plus one beer and all a glass of water at no charge  we still left paying a bill of a little more than 650rmb
it adds up fast and its become a running joke in our home now if we are about to purchase anything over $100 that we spent more than that on pizza

the service was good all the staff very nice no complaints on the taste or quality of the food either but it wasnt enough to make me ever want to return  and i have had better pizza for far less even in china pisa pizza in nanjing china comes to mind

so if you want to prove your wealth and impress someone with your love for pizza and ability to toss away money  pizza express is the place to go, so here we are at the marriott courtyard pudong on the 2nd evening and just wanting some comfort food just around the corner was the pizza express which was well known by the 2 english ladies in my party with their recommendation i tried the sloppy giuseppe which was such an easy pizza to eat we also added a peking duck pizza to be shared and after that and some beers we left very comfortable indeed good, i cant say i eat pizzas every day but i do love a good thin crust pizza with a glass of red i popped in to pizza express and enjoyed the nice and simple good quality pizzaswaiters were friendly with speedy service and even the odd tasty dessertcheers, this restaurant is very convenient if your in the area or staying at the portman ritz carlton beyond that there are much better pizza options we had the peking duck pizza which was ok and the margarita pizza which was dreadful it was missing large portions of cheese and soggy in places, good place for lunches when we came here it was full of people we were seated quickly the service in this place is very very very good but thats about it the food and specifically the pizzas are a real hogwash the salad were great i ordered a summer salad and my wife ordered a blue cheese salad they were perfect loved it but the pizza omg really bad the tomato sauce on the pizza was too much it was dripping off the pizza the cheese was not at all in tandem the most unbalanced pizza i have ever had it was an american peperoni pizza the tomato sauce almost tasted like tomato ketchup sweet and tangy i read about it about how its a speciality but when applied in balance not when over done it really felt like eating tomato ketchup on a very soggy pizza base the pizza base was white without any blemishes or signs of cooking

overall i will not recommend this place unless the chef is fired or they change italian family recipes that they claim in the menu

bit the service was perfect, ive been to pizza marzano in grand gateway mall countless time this year its so good i keep coming back the service is impeccable and the managers get an a+ for their service and kindness to their patrons the service is quick and the food is always delicious the dough balls and salads are to die for, the place is in a shopping mall so there is not much to atmosphere nice spot after serious shopping

comparing to its surpass court counter part this place was falling far behind in service we went on a monday night the place was pretty empty with 6 waitrons on the floor they still managed to forget my drink and not refill our free flow ice tea so really there is no excuse

the pizza crust was not that crisp so no brownie point from me

their rosemary bread was good though not as crispy as id like but the flavour was very aromatic","dumpling restaurant",0.370121242344349
229,"our last night in shanghai we ate dinner here and had another great experience in this marriott the food was very good, tried the set dinner at wan hao restaurant during my recent stay at jw marriott tomorrow square loved the ambience and the food is awesome great service by the mr joe always making sure the food is served in a timely manner and warm great place for family dinner gathering dr e chow, buffet lunch came with meeting package great dim sum local team loved the food esp steamed crabs which were in season not cartbased so orders take a little time but well worth it, we had lunch here after arriving to hotel while waiting for our rooms we had dim sum which was delicious staff was very courteous and attentive and some spoke english quite welltry it youll like it, the best part of staying at the jw marriott in shanghai is wan hao restaurant on the 39th floor year after year it wins awards for best authentic chinese cuisine with an added flair of modern cooking techniques you would have a difficult time finding a better restaurant the room is comfortable and the staff very knowledgeable and courteous, i just want to say that this hotel stay was the most pleasant stay we have ever had at any hotel anywhere in the world right from the hotel entrance concierge lobby staff pool rooms cleanliness food everything i would especially like to thank maria the director of guest relations at the hotel for her warmth and her helpful nature nothing was too much trouble for her and she always took out time to have a brief chat really felt welcomed also the food was excellent we are strictly vegetarian and were visiting there with two of the fussiest kids but the restaurant staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs and even cooked special meals for us
also the hotel is very conveniently located to visit the attractions near peoples square, pricey but overall good food and service the view was very nice and service was good portions compared to price were on the small size, after arriving from a long tiring flight we went to this restaurant hoping for delicious comfort food what we got instead was terribly slow service a tiny bowl of congee with just chicken bones fast food quality dimsum fresh mango juice made from concentrate and an exorbitant bill for what we got i suggest to just visit the marriot cafe or other nearby restaurants instead of eating here, a very broad selection of authentic chinese cuisines in their menu

we had the king prawns with wasabi mayo an old favourite of my that did not disappoint and the steamed mandarin fish absolutely superb

its on the pricey side considering usual chinese food prices but worth it particularly if youre staying in the jw marriott and it is convenient to try

people who are more looking for your bastardised western versions of popular asian dishes may not enjoy this place come here if you want authentic, excellent food and service was very well presented and food was unique and charming i know that is a strange word for food but it was, as a regular guest in the jw marriott i also eat on a regular basis in the wan hao restaurant sometimes alone very relaxing or as business dinner with a group

the food is always of high quality i never have been disappointed also the service is for shanghai standards very polite and helpful peking duck is always perfect i wouldnt call it authentic chinese food what exactly is that anyway but highstandard chinese food

the wine menu is the reason why i dont give full points it is in my opinion not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant and hotel the sommelier should work on that

prices are according to the location, we love this place although it is at a 5star hotel it is very authentic and clean
the beijing duck tastes better than the ducks in beijing
the environment is nice and services are great
each weekend we are in shanghai we would go there for lunch, if you would like to try some authentic shanghai local dishes with a quiet cozy and romantic environment you may come here i had a few dinners and saturday or sunday brunches there my last meal there was group dinner with more than 30 alums

it servers local shanghai food with a little canton twist i met chef once when we had a group dinner there the restaurant usually is not crowded except sat or sun brunch you have book a table a couple days in advance if youd like to have brunch there services always is great there

below are a few dishes which i would recommend you to try when you are there
sauteed river shrimp with clear sauce
hot and sour soup with seafood
wokfried diced chicken with three cups seasoning in black pot with bones
grilled shredded fish with ginger and lemon sauce
panfried shredded beef with black pepper and sweet bean
stewed pork belly and whole egg in brown sauce, recently i had dinner with a business associate at the wan hao chinese restaurant on the 39th floor of the jw marriott hotel at the tomorrow square in shanghai we were pleased to have a table by the window offering us a splendid view of the shanghai city from such high level  although we would have to stand up to observe the streets below

the second impression we got was the young service staff were busy but very pleasant and professionally friendly they really knew how to serve by the ways they took order served food and checking whether we were happy with the food and drinks the yunnan tea was first served in a glass pot and then poured into a cup for drinking instead of allowing the tea leaves to be soaked in hot water all the time  not many restaurants had the knowledge or care to do so properly

what appealed most to me was the way the dishes were available in different portion size for 1 to 2 persons for 34 persons and for larger group  with adjusting prices accordingly in this way smaller group like ours could ordersample more samples without worrying about wasting any food that could not be finishedconsumed

amongst the dishes we had that evening we liked its soy marinated chicken bbq pork marinated with honey and seafood sauce fried scallops wrapped in bacon stirfried guangdong choi sum veggie and stirfried flat rice noodles with beef and soy sauce but the wagyu beef was a disappointment  too dry and too much seasoning but with little wagyu beefs natural taste","Chinese cuisine",0.724069656310292
23,"my husband and i walked into the waldorf astoria long bar on a friday night and enjoyed a lovely evening listening to an american jazz ensemble with a singer who sounded just like frank sinatra i would have loved an ipa but their beer offerings were minimal my husband ordered a dortmunder beer which was nice served in a tall glass which we both shared

we returned to the long bar on the following night a sunday and as there was no entertainment it was pretty dead

so hit it up on a friday or saturday night and enjoy the music and ambience, go early to get a good seat i think they open at 4 very pricey but the ambiance is excellent as are the drinks worth if just to check it off your list of must sees, arranged to meet some business colleagues at 630pm last wednesday as i opened the door to enter the bar a staff member blocked my entry and shut the door and told me i could not go in as all the seats were occupied i looked in as i was about to enter and there was plenty of standing room  what bar does not allow customers in just because the seats are occupied wont go back to the long bar in a hurry plenty of nice bars to choose from around the bund, we were here to have a drink and chill very nice place with great bar foods we ordered a chicken quesadilla and sliced ham to share very nice service also very good, this is a highend bar in a luxury hotel so it is expensive surprised but you get what you pay for the classic cocktails are wonderful the historic interior is beautiful and the atmosphere on a friday night is lively thanks to the jazz band great peoplewatching too, firstly we search our lonely planet pocket guide for bars in shanghai we found the long bar what it didnt say was it was within the waldorf astoria  we found that out after we arrived at the front of the building it was dark and gloomy inside and we had to use our phones to see the menu im guessing its supposed to be a place for wealthy people who dont care about prices  there were 4 of us  we had 2 alcoholic drinks one lemonade and a serve of spring rolls  it cost aud$19800 yep  thats right the service wasnt that great  maybe thats because we werent dressed in suits and had our beanies on because it was zero degrees outside wouldnt go back even with a million dollars, the long bar dates back to the british presence in shanghai
it is a great place to soak up the atmosphere of a previous age, i love this bar in every aspects i came to have some drinks here almost every nights during my stay at the waldorf astoria hotel

friendly staff especially the bar manager  johnny who always greet us and give us some tips about the drinks and the city is the key that brought us back here every single nights

i found the live jazz band here is superb smoking is allowed and a good collection of cigars is available

advanced reservation is recommended, you hear a lot about the long bar and its good immaculate service and truly excellent drinks make it the perfect place to while away the later part of an evening the band are pretty good despite their hilariously egotistical between song chat

this bar will break the bank so save it for a special occasion or come during happy hour, definitelygo for a drink at this lovely bar we stopped in on valentines day after walking the bund and were pleasantly surprised by the bar and jazz trio playing just perfect the bar is truly longand goes for miles not really you can have a glass of wine a custom cocktail or enjoy a cigar lit tableside by the waiter, we were staying in the hotel for ten lovely days the long bar was always an easy place to have a drink before or after dinner or meet up with friends the service was impeccable and after the first visit i was never asked for my room number the food was excellent, a must do when you are at the bund  to have a drink  or one of their famous cocktails  in the famous long bar in the waldorf  nice atmosphere  in one end of the bar is a cigar corner  in the other end an oyster bar  and some live music in the evenings relaxing atmosphere in a setting of the 20s, not a lot going on here the history of the place is quite exciting but did not find a very interesting vibe cocktails were just ok and very pricey, one of the nicest bars ive been to i really loved the atmosphere in this place i thing its quite famous as people come from all over the city we saw this bar as we were staying in the hotel we visited a couple of times great service great atmosphere, i was at the long bar because i am staying at the waldorf astoria i wanted to organise a simple and casual birthday drinks for my gq editor i didnt like to go there at first but its more convenient for our group who all stayed at the hotel the decor is kinda traditional jazz bar which is fine i asked the hotel concierge to prepare a surprise birthday cake and asked the waitress to bring out when we all arrived unexpectedly the hotel didnt have the whole cake so they gotta order from the bakery which was ok after opened a bottle of champagne surprisingly the waitress served the cake in the unexpected way she served the cake while its still in the box with the cheapest paper plates and plastic knife as attached photos she didnt take the cake out from the box didnt put the cake on the plate and of course didnt put candles on cake i was shocked to see that then my assistant gotta run out to teach her how to prepare my question the waitress didnt have the common sense how to manage my simple request or my request was too difficult or strange here in shanghai wont go back there for sure this incident also made me feel that the hotel doesnt offer the refined service, as the porters open the huge wrought iron doors to this fabulous hotel youre taken back in time entering from the bund side the long bar is just inside but miles away from the teeming crowds my mind ran wild with the desire to relive the millions of conversations those mahogany walls have heard over the more than 10 decades this grand lady has survived the drinks were ample but plan on blowing the budget  best not to have one to really enjoy this vista and its abundant vibe we were treated to a live music combo that set the perfect mood and allowed us to truly sit back and drink it all in wear your best  i cant imagine ever being overdressed for this regal room, i never thought i would say these words i had the best burger of my life in china we enjoyed a late dinner and drinks upon arrival at the hotel followed by cocktails on another day service was impeccable and the food and drinks were great get the wagyu burger, a place to see when in shanghai if you
 like old movies
 favor jazz music
 love classic cocktails

the history of the place is mind stunning  we felt like in the 1930s, nice old fashioned atmosphere with live music expensive but good cocktails beware of the smoke my hair and dress was stinking of cigarette smoke afterwards, it is the best in shanghai in terms of the ambience service and music so classy the band is excellent would love to go there again, shanghai has many great watering holes but the best one in my opinion is the long bar at the waldorf great ambiance great drinks and excellent service the lvl band helps also to make a great experience, a wonderful old bar on the bund smacking of history and class the drinks are lovely and the service is very good and the food if you eat there is not excessive but well presented and tasty we really enjoyed the vesper martinis, we drank and ate here a few times a lot of fun great cocktails great service and great food including oysters, decided to stop at the hotel and wait for a friend the bar was very dark but very cool many people were enjoying themselves the drinks menu is extensive and service was as you would expect for the brand i will certain return, we decided to try this out read lots of reviews we went early evening and spent about 2 hours plus here it was nice and quiet so easy to get a table there was a good selection of cigars and the wine list was good too the red wine was lovely not so cheap but then great location comfy leather armchairs lovely jazz music playing the band had not come on yet some nice nibbles too olives nuts and pretzels nice decor shame it was so cold in there and ended up coming away with a cold service was good not so easy to get a taxi though leaving as they cant stop on the main road so we walked round the corner, we stayed at the waldorf astoria which made is easy to visit the long bar beautiful 100+ year old bar in colonial style jazz music begins at 10pm it is not cheap its in the wa and is quite noisy probably not the place to have a nice quiet conversation, saturday nightthe bar was crowded good mix of chinese and foreigners enjoying the music and having a good time its funloud and rather masculine its not a place for conversation its a good place to end your evening with a good cocktail its the waldorf expect higher prices, we stayed at the waldorf and on the bund for 9 nights after the second timebecause it was in the hotel we didnt go back it was expensive no view
we found better options, this bar has a lot of historyit was crowded and seems to be very popularthis used to be the british mens clubvery well work the wait to get in, very chilled out old style bar very classy and i really enjoyed the few hours i spent here it was good to try somewhere new and the drinks are fantastic i tried a martini infused with peach and sichuan pepper this is one of their signature drinks and i really enjoyed it next i tried a different drink with passion fruit lime and fresh thyme perfectly constructed and full of flavour this was a great recommendation from the barman

the service is very attentive but not over the top and it was easy to order drinks and food when i needed to i also tried the steak sandwich and it was delicious heaps of perfectly cooked steak on a toasted bruschetta with potato wedges the perfect accompaniment to my drinks and im sure i will be back again, a step back in time fun live classic music fun menu of drinks great atmosphere perfect place for a nightcap, pop in for a cocktail and enjoy a taste of old shanghai it feels like a remnant from the days when the foreign concessions operated along the bund, i have visited the long bar many times over the past few years and it is truly a great experience the drinks are a bit expensive but i have never been disappointed and if my schedule would allow the time i would be there each night from the moment you walk in through the front doors until you leave them you will have a hard time believing you are in china, live music cocktails and wine with great service  what more can you ask for in a bar restored to its historic character, the band is top notch if you like old school jazz this is the place the vibe is truly special the drinks are expensive but youre paying for the band theres no cover charge the drinks are some of the best in town you will not find a better atmosphere anywhere, visiting the long bar was a really great experience so authentic and so much history huge range of cocktails and fine wines may also have some excellent beers just a wonderful atmosphere, long bar drinks are made with great care and fresh mixes old world comfort i have repeatedly met business associates and friends here before and after dinner good jazz music at night daytime feel is one of great relaxation excellent staff polite and attentive both bar and wait staff one of the places that makes shanghai special, at first this is a bar and not a restaurant thus wrongly listed with the opening of the waldorf astoria hotel the long bar from 1911 was completely restored in the original art deco style the long bar has a long history and is one of the most famous bars of the world enjoy your pre or after dinner drinks here especially if you like single malt scotch whisky or a cocktail it is an insult calling this historic bar a restaurant, my fiance and were looking for an evening of live jazz while in shanghi the long bar is in the beautiful waldorf astoria and is very comfortable the bar is the longest bar i ever saw probably 100 feet or more the service was exceptional and the scotch and wine selection was magnificent if you are wanting to unwind i highly recommend this place, this is a nice bar for an after dinner drink the service is good and the building still retains a lot of its colonial charm there are much better places to eat locally but if you fancy a snack there is food available in the evenings there is often live music, elegant bar that serves good drinks with very good service matching this luxurious bar are snacks like spanish ham oysters etc and of course the luxurious bill  well worth the experience, the burgers are quite good here but the oysters were overpriced and unfresh we end up a bill of 1200 for two champagne by the glass is not cold enough when it gets served dont go for the house cocktail which was a disaster, gorgeous bar beautiful decor menu for food is ok waygu burger was quite good drinks are not the best and trying to get a drink is a challenge kept getting flat tonic and service was so so a bit cheesy but still ok, i was recommended to come here for jazz and i wasnt disappointed the long bar not only offered cocktail mocktail but also cigars and oysters if you were to look for external view then this is not the place for you jazz commenced from 10pm service was brisk and attentive smoky dim light art deco leather couches made long bar a rather inviting and decadent place to linger in the place isnt cramped in and so you have oodles of privacy and space it is well priced and a great surprise highly recommended, conveniently located on the bund the place has a rich history and an elegant ambiance a nice place for a drink and check out the oyster bar while you are there and while sitting in there can you imagine it used to be home of the first kfc in china , during my one week stay at the waldorf long bar was my favorite spot the staff knew my name my wine got prepared as soon i walked in and i enjoyed the olives and pretzels as snack which were free every night around 10pm jazz music started and the bar filled up with a nice crowd on different nights there were different mucisians surprisingly no entrance fee as charge looking forward to my next visit in september kind regards mr farrand, i have been to the long bar on several visits to shanghai and i have never been disappointed it is an expats hang out and you can find some very interesting people to chat with
the western food is a welcome relief from chinese the beer is cold and reasonable, wanted to see the bar where the singapore sling originated

the service was alright was a bit crowded when i was there

there was live music being playedthe ambience was pretty laid back

just be careful if youre every going to try the oysters felt sick after eating some, it certainly is a beautiful mahogany bar but i found it very very smoke filled and at 630pm it was interestingly emptyand certainly no jazz band was playing the drinks are overpriced but that seems to be how the touristy areas in shanghai roll, even if you are not staying at the waldorf stop at the long bar for a cocktail or after dinner drink it is the perfect shanghai experience from an era long gone

vintage drinks are on the menu and the vibe is cool and jazzy if you are lucky the crowd is as wellyou never know in shanghai

the staff is pleasant and attentive the mixes are perfect i certainly enjoyed my martini

cheers","Taiwanese cuisine",0.833195064674122
230,"very nice bagels here good and fast service but a bit pricey not the biggest amount of choices i believe around 7 different kinds, a reasonable selection on the menu the staff were very friendly and helpful i got 2 bagels with melted cheeses and house pickles  very nice indeed but i think theyre rather overpriced at the equivalent of <u+00a3>560 each, oh my god

the standard menu bagels are fantastic or you can mix and match from their diy menu decadent and so so tasty  this is a regular mustdo for at least one lunch whenever i am in shanghai

you can go the healthy route and select a bagel you choose the bread and topping type eg whitewholemeal sesame or cheese etc and stuff it with rabbit food  or you can have a breakfastlunchdinner option by adding extra cheese ham and bacon  as i did, we love chinese food but to find a bit of home comfort in a delicious bagel in shanghai was amazing these bagels their sandwiches and cookies are some of the best we�ve had anywhere they are super fresh and made using quality ingredients we had the breakfast bagel i think it�s called the brekkie very yummy with their own cured bacon the nutella sandwich is so gooey they also offer boxing cat beer which is a local brewery you gotta try their fat chewy cookies aftering eating our bagels we loaded up on a few cookies to last the day
there are two locations but we visited the xintiandi location twice and it�s a very short walk from the xintiandi station lavender 10 subway line we will always eat here when in shanghai, we wanted breakfast and seems a lot of places on sunday morning were shut so we stumbled across this place amazingly the staff all speak excellent english menu in english too there is an outside area and a small seating area inside with high bar seating too its really quirky and there is a clothes shop at the back it was halloween so really well decorated our bagels the brekkie one with egg and cheese were delicious you have a choice of bagels seeded ones and different types they were fresh and tasty the tea choices three pigs are lovely and service is good
reasonable too, the restaurant is a bit small and it was uneasy for us to find a place to seat we have to wait for another people to go because it was summer and we wanted to seat inside however the bagels are really tasty we tried the pizza bagel and the parmesan bread yummy, we love the newest spread the bagel and stumbled upon it by chance after we discovered the nanchang lu location was temporarily closed down alfresco seating and a nice touch to be located inside the alter concept store at fashionable xintiandi style mall, the bagels are great always freshly made and of consistent good quality ive been there on average twice per month every now and then they dont have my favorite everything bagel but plenty of other choices to try  i highly recommend louis veggie , truly the best bagels in shanghai i always take the parmesan bread just awesome nice terrace cute staff and cool owner wish to have one in jingan soon
cheers to christine love it, spread the bagel is an excellent choice for lunch in xintiandi fresh bagels superb coffee and good service recommended, went with a friend tried the spicy sausage on while wheat and the classic bacon egg and cheese both sandwiches were excellent the honey mustard aioli put the spicy sausage sandwich in another leaguethe bagels are a good combination of bready without being too filling

if i had to nitpick i would just request the bagels be a little more crispy on the sandwiches not to concerning with the flavors the sandwiches provide, i havent had a bagel in at least two years and now i cant remember why the bagel was excellent and the coffee was perfect for a rainy morning the manager is an american woman who delivers service with a smile, can�t recommend this place highly enough for quality ingredients and bagels at an affordable price and in a very stylish location it will be even better come warmer weather when you can sit outside and watch the world go by

big fan of spread the bagel from their nanchang road main deli and pop up shop on wulumuqi road so i obviously had to try out their new xintiandi location too and yep they are still the purveyors of the best bagels i�ve had outside of the us i�m trying to think of one specific bagel to recommend but we tried several and they were all excellent loved the bagel chips that came with it too

the restaurant is located in a shopping mall filled with up and coming chinese designers and trendy brands from around the world i�d never been before but will revisit when i need my next bagel fix

location is perfect for a bite while sightseeing in the area but without having to pay the extortionate xintiandi rates also great to grab a quick bite if you work nearby or for a coffee and bagel while you mull over that potential purchase

don�t miss it, recently opened a wonderful little bagel place with any amounts of extras and variations  its bagel heaven that will transport you instantly from shanghai to the big apple the best culinary discovery of my 2month trip to shanghai  i lived off the bagels for days ","dumpling restaurant",0.994687211401425
24,"our usa group visit to shanghai after comparing with a lot of restaurants finally we choose here the restaurant has convenient transportation and elegant environmentour manager is very satisfied, i recommend it for anyone like a good food and shisha all people in the restaurant are friendly the food is very tasty and fresh ingredientsit is real moroccan restaurant, the tajine of this restaurant is very good i like it firstthis restaurant serves the best foodyou nevertaste nextthis restaurant has a lot of programs for customers every nightfinallythis restaurant hasbest musicthat can make you feelright, we ate here twice once for lunch and then we came back for dinner the food is very good and the atmosphere was very nice there were not many people there when we had lunch and the food came out in a reasonable time but when we went back for dinner they were very busy and it took a long time for the food to come we werent in a hurry so it wasnt a problem but i would not go there if you are in a rush we had a nice walk on the bund after dinner which made the overall experience a good one, this is a wonderful morocco restaurant maybe it is the best in shanghai i tasted the distinctive foodits really hard to leave and let me linger
i will come again, we had chicken and beef tajine and they taste awesome we had also soup harira which was extremely delicious the staff was very kind and they speak english the restaurant is decorated in a unique and cozy style and it is only steps to shanghai bund i will highly recommend this place to ppl who are looking for a decent place to hang out with friends, the restaurant is nicely located in the bund but i dont think it is worth to try their food so i dont recommend this restaurant if you are in the bund even if you never tried moroccan food there are far better restaurants to taste this type of food and at a more affordable price

the service is good some waiters can speak a good english
the taste of their couscous is fine but its really nothing special for its price quantity was okay i also ordered a chocolate milkshake which its taste is not even close to a starbucks coffee but two times more expensive and a brownie with chocolate ice cream ive never eat a brownie that hard but the ice cream was excellent
the atmosphere is great the restaurant is pretty but thats the only points i would give to this restaurant, i used to live in morocco before and now im leaving in shanghaiso far the best moroccan food experience after 5 years in shanghai
we came for a birthday dinner on a saturday night i have to say frankly i didnt expect anything special after all the some reviews i read on this place but i have to share my feelings as we had a very nice time there
first i like the asmosphere its a cozy place with nice decoration music is not too loud
we share the food so we try many things from their menu chicken and almond pastilla beef couscous chicken lemonolive tajine lamb prunesalmond tajine and also lamb kefta all the food was good very tasty large portions i especially love the lamb and prune tajine meat was so tender it is true that they serve starter and mains at he same time but as we were sharing and only took one starter so it was ok
we also try their hookah and moroccan tea very nice ones my favorite hookah was melon and vanilla
attentive service they were supposed to close at 11pm but we stay a little after midnight and they didnt let us feel like they want us to leave so they can close
price was fair with dinner winechampagne and shisha it was less than 400 rmb per person which is a treat but worth it
i definitely recommend this place and i will come back again for sure for tea lamb tajine and nice shisha, very beautiful quite prestigious  fantastic restaurant located in a very nice place in shanghai staffed by a very welcoming persons esp ms lili  really i enjoyed my diner with them
they provide halal arabic moroccan foods, maybe we chose the wrong night i can not be sure it was valentines day and the restaurant was serving a set menu to all
the layout was terrible with all the table set out like a row of school desks with very narrow gaps between hardly a romantic setting it also appeared that bookings had been made for set times and all those booked for that time were served together
the included glass of wine was the smallest glass of wine i have every seen not much more than a damp glass nowhere near the claimed 150ml and a fresh bottle was opened for every table in the hope you would pay for the full bottle what they did with so many 75 full bottle i do not know
the soup arrived missing  as we only found later  the bread then half way through eating that the sharing bowl of salad arrived and was placed on the table that was hardly started when the tajine was also placed on a crowded table swiftly followed by the lamb why were we not allowed to finish a course before the next one arrived at this stage we realised that we had not been served the bread so enquired as to why to be told  we forgot  how can you make mistakes serving a set meal we were offered free coffees to compensate and ordered a cappuccino and a black coffee we got two cappuccinos unbelievable
there were plenty of waiting staff but they had obviously not been shown their duties correctly and many tables were being taken the wrong things at the wrong time the two management people seemed to be out of their depth and even had to make a telephone call to someone else when we asked for a receipt
i do not understand how this place gets so high in the rankings it certainly does not deserve it, really enjoy this place we started with the traditional morocco soup and free bread after we ordered beef kufuta tajine and vergetab couscous we were so full sweet service and all not expensive we will come back, we just had dinner a few days ago at tagine and had a really nice evening the food was very good particularly the eggplant salad beef kofta tagine and couscous as we had just visited morocco in december and january it was a nice way to remember our trip and chat with our friends about the wonders of marrakech in terms of a travel destination we also really liked the atmosphere in the restaurant it is quiet with soft music in the background allowing you to enjoy a conversation with friends this is not always easy to find as many shanghai restaurants are very loud and conversation can be challenging, my friends also recommend this restaurant i final book a table tonight we came here we order a hommos and beef kofta tajine lamb cutlet and balaclava dessert nice environment warm greeting anticipate service authentic food amazing aperitif tajine is very bueatiful i like moroccan food i will come back, really good tasted food it is healthy and nature the atomosphere is also really good love it willing to come next time, the food were very delicious
especially the chicken tajine  lamb chop empyloee and service were also very nice
love this place, it was a great lunch everything s perfect in this charming restaurant very quiet place beautiful decoration friendly and discrete staff and the must of the must  the food
incredible tajine well cookedsmells and savors from marocco are the same than we know and love
thanks i had a very good time there, really authentic selection of moroccan food including houmous and various tagines would recommend a small size tagine as they are huge could even share a small tagine with some other food only downfall is the really overpriced drinks and beers but i guess this is just shanghai really good location as you can just walk along the bund after would definitely visit again, the music was authentic as was the decor but aside from that nothing else

we called to make a reservation for a late lunch around 4pm and were told they had no timeslots until 6pm so we thought wed try our luck and arrived to discover an empty restaurant

the prices made our eyes pop out of our head somewhatparticularly considering how humble north african food is ingredients are not all that expensive since its been a while since we had north african food we thought wed try a large tagine waiter informed us it was for 4 people and some mezze moroccan salad set everything that arrived tasted bland not fresh and inauthentic the large tagine was really for 2 people not 4 and we left with a hefty bill

a disappointing experience to say the least would not go there again im not sure why this restaurant has such great reviews if youve had authentic moroccan or north african cuisine in morocco or even in europe this doesnt come anywhere close, everything is very good the tajine was very delicious
the service also very good we like very muchwe will come back, a ceremony of ckgsb we had really good food here the taste the service are prefect we had a good time here i would come here next time with friends, highly recommend  the best moroccan restaurant ive been  awesome environment with beautiful decorations very special both food and place near the bund  <u+8fd9><u+5bb6><u+9910><u+5385><u+5728><u+5916><u+6ee9><u+65c1><u+8fb9><u+73af><u+5883><u+5f88><u+597d><u+67d4><u+548c><u+7684><u+706f><u+5149><u+6d6a><u+6f2b><u+7684><u+6c1b><u+56f4><u+97f3><u+4e50><u+4e5f><u+5f88><u+68d2><u+5f53><u+7136><u+8fd8><u+6709><u+7279><u+522b><u+7684><u+6469><u+6d1b><u+54e5><u+98df><u+7269><u+6109><u+5feb><u+9002><u+5408><u+548c><u+670b><u+53cb><u+4e00><u+8d77><u+6765><u+5403>, please keep in mind that the title applies to only those who are just minded or in other words not self indulgent as to what they expect from others while falling short of it themselves sorry however having read some reviews here and elsewhere one might get the impression that there are an awful lot of connoisseurs or actual critics out there enough on this point
tajine has never failed to satisfy i have been there at least 5 times the moments of pleasure just seem to blend together thus it could have been 4 more i always mean to order something different when i do go but i always endup ordering the mixed grilled platter absolutely divine capitalization intended the mint tea is oh what the heck heavenly on the olfactory senses as well as the palate your nose catches the mint even before pouringthough i confess to having a particularly extra keennose for such thingsthank goodness the desserts are equally delicious especially the baklava it would be remiss of me to not give rightful due to the staff of tajine they are in a wordor twocourteous and attentive a special thank you to the bartender robin i do hope i have your name right for that unique twist on the mojito ginger root was it i am so impressed by and with tajine that it has become a nobrainer destination for my first meal upon arriving in shanghai a sort of personal ritual as it were alas i will definitely be there for lunch and dinner january 20th keep up the phenomenal work tajine ps the chef as it turns out spent 5 years in canada which being canadian myself was an interesting sidenote, the food was amazing goodwe went there with my friends and loved the food all delicousthe service outstandingbest moroccan food in shanghai, excellent restaurant we went there 5 adults we ordered a big morocco mix bbq and tajine the meat import from australia halad really deliciousprobably the best moroccan restaurant in china my friends been to morocco he told me the plate name was tajine they bought from morocco looks so beautiful we will come back again , so my family and i were in shanghai and we decided to get some moroccan food we went to the restaurant and it looked nice so we went inside as most people do and we looked at the menu it looked exquisite and various other things among the like it was so crowded but we still got seated within 10 minutes i was so impressed once we got seated the server promptly took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to order which i like i ordered the chicken kabob and it was so goooooood probably the best chicken in shanghai everyone got their food and everything went so swimmingly everyone agreed their food was excellent i would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends if they are ever in china, it is delicious and environment just like in the localitywhats more it is worth to come again, a restaurant on east yanan rd i come with my friendsand i think the food is very delicious and the service is very good, very friendly and attentive staff enjoyed the complexities of the flavors of the dishes we ordered we had tajine lamb and barbequed prawns both were excellent, supplied with diligence food high quality memorials make your tongue feel excellent trip experience warm north african decorations and kind waitress impressed me very much, i felt like home  warm and welcoming staff mint tea on seating with traditional morroco cakes many choices on menu if you are looking for a gastronomy dinner or lunch  delicious mediterranean food  complete dinner costs around 200 rmb  person  will back soon , first time to morocco restaurant in shanghaideep impressedvery good taste and confortable envirorement the lamp is my favorite and will recommend to my friends, it has been a wonderful experience and a pleasant night to dine here multi linguistic service lite up the atmosphere the food has been great very thoughtful cusine proper moroco flavor you got to try their mint tea, very friendly  welcoming morrocan restaurant in the heart of the bund area for a traveller  their english was very good  helpful but not expected so ordering was easy fresh tasty and well presented morrocan food  great choices and designed to share wine was very limited as per usual in shanghai  but a basic chilean red went well for about 250 yuan $50 aud, very rice restaurant on the bund good service delicious moroccan food and a mint tea just perfect  we ordered harira couscous and dessert and they were all excellent i invite all my friends to eat here and try tasty moroccan food , tajine is on the second floor of a building which is right on the bund as with many buildings on the bund access is from the side street after a couple of weeks in china the quietsoothing atmosphere of tajine was most welcome unlike the upmarket restaurants nearby there was no pressure to order and our waiter ali was happy to spend time answering any questions we had about the menu while we decided a small bread basket with warm rolls arrived with a dip of fresh herbs and olive oil there is a small but reasonably priced wine list the meals are generous portions and can be ordered in 3 sizes i ordered the small lamb tangine and had difficulty finishing it the lamb was mouth wateringly tender piping hot with prunes olives and crunchy almonds scattered through my husband opted for the chicken kebabs which again were freshly cooked tasty and generous in size there was no room left for desert but the almond icecream nearly forced a change of mind tanjine restaurant is a little gem among the hype of shanghais upmarket restaurants, this is most halad food i ever had in shanghai  oliver cooking oil  lamp is nice nice service chief is moraccan i believe you will like the mint tea also , the mojito seemed very virgin we had the salmon tajine a ridiculous small portion was served to us whereas we had ordered the largest out of 3 portion sizes for a very expensive price music was repetitive with the same song 3 times during the dinner run away, the tajine maroccan restaurant is lokated near the bund and have a nice interrior
the food is very delishes and the staff is friendly and some of them speak very well english the price is a little bit high for chineese conditions but it<u+00b4>s for us was the price ok for this special and very delicios meal, like the title it was the sencond choice for our dinnerbut it was so surprising for us at lastso impressed with all the cuisines especially for tanjine chicken lamb bbq, my guest was a bit nervous about arab food which made the introduction all the more fun but to be honest the dishes are pretty inauthentic at least if you are used to moroccan meals in the us and europe the appetizers including hummus and pita bread were weak points the couscous was way too mushy but the chicken tagine was tender and flavorful with a tasty chickpea stew for something different and if you are in the area go we were the only ones there for dinner and would like some company the waitstaff is very nice too, was greeted warmly by soukaina whos moroccan and hence very passionately explained the dishes showed me pictures of how a tajine looks like as it was my first tajine meal and made me feel so comfortable in this authentically decorated moroccan restaurant
the lamb tajine prepared using new zealand lamb is not only very delicious but its so tender and juicy served with potatoes onions raisins prunes olives and almonds
apart from lamb there are plenty of options with chicken and beef at this halal restaurant special thanks to both soukaina and lily for their warm hospitality, really enjoyed the dinner  they have a various menu and very friendly staff i was extremely satisfied with the taste of chicken tajine that i ordered i will go back there soon to try other moroccan dishes, we ate here twice in 2 weeks ones with a bigger group 14 people and ones with 4 we like the food and service the staff is nice and the food excellent it is hallal prepared and the taste is real maroccan it was very quiet on a sunday evening they have to reconsider their prices in shanghai are a lot of restaurants also very good ones were you can eat for the half of their price, we enjoyed a nice early dinner 400 pm and there was nobody there yet lucky us because my understanding is that there is usually a crowd i enjoyed a beef and carrot and peas meal and my son enjoyed a lemon chicken dish both were delicious they served soft buns with an olive dip which was a nice addition to our meal the hostess was so sweet sure it was pricey but truth be toldi got tired of paying cash for everything and i finally got to use my credit card haha, very nice restaurantgood foodgood peoplegood environmentnear the bund areaalways good to take friends here, the food is amazingauthentic moroccan food i personally enjoyed the lamb tajineso many other items in the menu to try and the marketing manager is the best next time i come to shanghai i will come here againdefinitely telling my friends to try it, it is really nice and tasty and the host is really nice and kind and cares a lot about the feeling of guests, nice service and tastemany foreigners have dinner here to enjoy the holiday fresh steak and snacks, food is amazing very friendly and welcoming stuff and excellent service everything was great thank you, we was there on friday night  we get suggested about this restaurant from a nearby friend  and its absolutely amazing  the harira soup was a really pleasure  full of mediterranean flavor  we also ordered a vegetarian tajine for our veg friend  well prepared the prawn tajine also was good and the best one was the lamb tajine  tender meat  great spices  service was good  highly recommended  we will definitely come back ","cafe",0.999748471849741
25,"this is seriously the only restaurant i miss in shanghai and i cannot wait till my next trip to shanghai so i can dine in this restaurant again

just a heads up  this restaurant is filled with foreigners which you may feel that it�s a tourist trap but for people who don�t fancy restaurants the locals frequent in shanghai like me i loved it not sure if they have tweaked the traditional recipe to cater to foreigners i�m just happy i found this place�, came here with a big group of locals and visitors and managed to get a private room to ourselves the food was very good and the resturant ex pat friendly there are pictures and there is a mix of very local delicacy eg chicken feet and more basic things like cauliflower and tofu etc the food is spicy but not burn your taste buds off kind of spicy you can also ask them to prepare things on the milder side the portions are decent and you could get 4 or 5 dishes for a group of 4the ribs and cauliflower were very good and so was the prawns in chilli pepper it gets busy so definitely try to book ahead, we ate here with a colleague from shanghai who took us out here traditional ambiance mix of locals and westerns  tourists
we had the ribs which had a unique taste the grilled vegetables were great as well

i would surely come back and recommend this place when you visit shanghai, this was stomping ground ten years ago i had to take my wife since i told her about this years past the same still have the same great food although foreigners like myself seemed to be in greater numbers than locals

the stew five layer pork is a must its chairman maos favorite pork ribs with chili and anise are tasty they have a choice of beer and wine selection but i still with the tsingtao draft if bund is a sight to see then this is a place to feast, the decoration there would give you a hunan feel and whet your appetite the spicy spare ribs which is their signature dish is very good but a bit too small and overpriced most of the food are spicy but you could still find some nonspicy ones on the whole a restaurant which is worth trying, the staffs were not that nice we have to set all chairs by ourselves which kind of disappointng a bit

they have english menu so u dont have to worry about playing guess challenge

and the food is ok just ok, followed as most of the times the trip advisor recommendations and found another restaurant which i will put on my shanghais favorites for sure
its a nice cosy and traditional place to have typical chinese  shanghainese  food service is good but food is great as you can see on the pictures we had the steamed frog which is one of the best in town in my opinion especially the soup is delicious but spicy as hell

will definitely get back there  what you get for your price in terms of quality is unbeatable

zai jian, it is a famous restaurant for the spicy food i can confirm that the quality is effectively good
i had a quick dinner with some good vegetables spicy very good
also the chicken in hunnan style was very good
the service is not really nice and they do not speak english
better to reserve in advance, definitely try the ribs overall a great authentic experience with great food i would like to have tried more so dont be shy and try a lot of different dishes, this is just ordinary chinese restaurant simple place with super delicious food really suit my taste whenever i come always see a lot of foreigner here must try two colors fish head pork ribs spicy chicken and for dessert should try banana caramel
this is one of my favorite yunan restaurant in shanghai good food and affordable price always want to go here at least once a month, its hard to notice this restaurant on the busy street as its located upstairs but once you are there the place is absolutely buzzing it seems popular with tourists and expats as well as locals

beware  portions are massive we ordered a side dish of eggplant and the bowl turned up huge crispy crab and chilli prawns were fabulous i always check out other peoples food as my eyes are bigger than my belly and it looked spectacular

the place is also a good people watching scene, the food here is delicious although this is by no means a fancy restaurant

for good chinese hunan style this is the place to go prices are ok not cheap but also not expensive

there are so many good dishes here and it is hard to go wrong some are worth a special mention the ribs are amazing a must try also good are the white broccoli hot pot and the egg plant

just give this place a try, foodies will argue whether dishuidong or guyi is the best hunan food in shanghai both great � i like dsd order the ribs 22 rmb each � they are big the �frog in bamboo tube� and i loved a simple vegetable dish of eggplant and green beans that veg dish epitomized hunan flavors to me instead of the piercing heat of sichuan and chongqing there is a low slow satisfying heat here somewhat smoky in flavor and it seems to just envelop you in this dish my guess is that the eggplant was first deep fried briefly to soften it then fried in the wok with the beans and peppers and spices the frog is one of my favorites � its just the legs so it is really meaty and the squeamish among you do not have to deal with the very froglooking ribcage etc that�s in most frog dishes the red peppers in this dish are the key they are soft and moderately spicy just bursting with flavor i think they are �pao jiao� that is spicy red peppers that have been soaked in a brine of various spices the atmosphere is informal and warm with woodcovered walls � and the bathroom is absolutely freezing in the winter who cares when the food keeps you warm
hint the place is up a flight of wooden stairs and out on the sidewalk they have a little podium manned by a receptionist the sign says the full name in chinese characters and i noticed several signs with the initials dsd as well, we have visited this restaurant for the first time the location is easy to access within city center it is an old shanghai building nicely decorated not too flashy but looking authentic
the food was i must say among the first 3 of all my travels within 24 different cities and many restaurants
for anyone who likes spicy food hunan kitchen is must to taste this restaurant is certainly among the best ones
however i must say that if you do not prefer spicy food there is not much else to eat as well
service was ok prompt and kind, the ribs were reviewed in a lonely planet guide i believe they have a very good reputation the seasoning they use here is wonderful they didnt disappoint i had the fried banana for dessert the portion was huge and delicious highly recommended, love the ribs and its spicy food it is a fantastic place for you if you like super spicy food i guess it is not a place for everyone, really great hot and sour tofu absolutely delicious green beans and eggplant very good cauliflower hot pot scrumptious a happy place beer on tap a great complement to the not too spicy food, in search of some spicy chinese food we found this place on ta arrived about 6pm on a tuesday night and found the place relatively empty however by 730pm it was nearly full

we tried 6 dishes and let me say if you are not a chilli fan this is definitely not the place for you each dish is brimming with chilli

we ordered the following the spare ribs the sweet and sour prawns the shredded beef the chilli egg plant chilli crab and the chicken with cayenne pepper

all of the dishes were loaded with chillies to the point that the guests next to us were physically sweating and the staff turned on the aircon the large selection of beers definitely came in handy

the food itself was delicious though with the eggplant beef and prawns being our top picks

they also provide you with watermelon after the meal to ease the heat

the restaurant is up some wooden stairs enjoyed by locals and foreigners alike, best value for money in town nice service not easy to find it is a small door with stairs leading up so watch out, a famous name being around many years in shanghai their spicy hunan dishes are delicious if you love spicy food this is the address to be added to your list, we went here with a friend who lived in shanghai and knew the tips and tricks she did order all dishes and they were all succulent we had 11 all and all and we loved them all great atmosphere super service try spare ribs the crab the fried veggies and for dessert fried banana balls caramelized yummy, the restaurant look is very local which is liked a must the ribs and re bun for dessert the restaurant is very clean and cheap, restaurant with wide menu to a great price and taste you can pick what you like from the chinese cousin there is both locals and foreigner eating here, this is a great restaurant thats popular with locals an foreigners alike we always visit when were in shanghai
the food is all very fresh full of flavour and heat and the restaurant atmosphere is great dont go expecting 5 star cuisine with starched table cloths and snooty staff but do go expecting great authentic food
when we first visited 10 years ago you could walk in off the street and get a table but booking is now essential, their signature dish is pork ribs it is a good place to start warming up toeating local chinese food you also see a lot of locals eating there its not expensive and they also have european beers to drain down that spicy chicken or pork ribs, we go here each time we visit shanghai and it is consistently delicious the clientele is a mixture of chinese and foreigners so this isnt an authentic local experience but dont be put off by this the food is much better than at many of the super pricy recommended usually by hotels tourist spots

the food is generally very hotspicy but as everything is freshly prepared you can ask for it to be toned down if you wish green beans with pork prawns on skewers you get about 12 smoked pork all really good there is a fair selection of wine at very reasonable prices, another shanghai favourite quite spicey cooking but fresh and nice and with reasonable wine too simple decor with checked table cloths, as mentioned by many other people the ribs are tender and delicious if you like lots of cumin we ordered a 2nd portion as everyone around us seemed to be having hotpot we ordered a tofu hotpot which we thought to be meatfree as there was no mention of meat in the short english description it had small pieces of smoked meat which did add a lovely flavour it was the same with the vegetables we had we didnt mind but for the vegetarians i would suggest that the meat question is put to the staff
most maybe all of the dishes have a lot of chilli  for me that was perfect less so for my husband who sweated a flood, for dinner specially on we reservation is really recommended they propose a blend of chinese different regions  with some hole specialities such as the cumin ribs the apple caramel or the fish with ketchup  sweet excellent right price 100 rmb per head, great place for expatriates to enjoy hunan food and located off huahai road i highly recommend the pork ribs, one of the best hunan restaurant judging by its plaque of awards at the restaurants entrance i cant be wrong

the ambient is eclectic and warmth and packed with diners the service is ok
we ordered maos shrimp spiced whole fish crispy hunan toufoo beancurd with chinese sausages maos chicken stir fried cauliflower and taro balls
althought its spicy but at its right paceexpect the flaming red chillies and oil in dish as its the essense of preparing hunan dishes that brings outs its fragrant and strong taste its a familiar taste for those who is a die hard fans of hunan cuisine, it seemed to be a locals spot and the restroom supported that theory i took it as a good sign that there were no western toilets we were happy that maredsous beer was on the menu our new favorite we like spicy food and enjoyed everything we ordered we had both the spare ribs and a heart shaped dish described as ribs in ketchup sauce we took the risk and ordered it it payed off the ribs and sauce were delicious no ketchup i was an immediate fan of the roasted cumin seeds on the spare ribs we had two types of shrimp dishes one covered in chili peppers and the hot and sour shrimp both were excellent we had a broccoli dish and snow peas with bacon both so good the snow peas were infused with the bacon flavor we had soup dumplings and fried bananas for dessert the bananas were fantastic and it was fun to watch the server pull them apart with chopsticks we would eat here frequently if we lived in shanghai and were very grateful to trip advisor for the tip, i love spicy food and the choices were plentiful my chinese distributor ordered the fish head with two different sauces and it was tasty they have several different beers on tap including tiger which is one of my favorite asian beers

after dinner in the small side room four tables we met another friend for a few more beers out in the main dining room as there were few empty tables i will return again, great food easy drinking beer and super fast service in a restaurant with good ambience recommend the pork ribs you do need to reserve a table in advance especially on weekends, was recommended here when staying at the 4 seasons if feels off the beaten track and very local but once youre in there the food is great and spicy without being overbearing

enjoy, absolutely genuine from meet to fish all is great  can go for anything without hesitation excellent value for money, one good thing about sites like tripadvisor is that you are given a legs up when it comes to venturing outside your comfort zone to search for good food especially if you looking for places outside the vicinity of your hotel

dsd as per the signboard on the main entrance downstairs is a comfy restaurant in maoming road look out for the narrow entrance by the side of the building which actually houses many fb outlets inside

we just had to order the muchraved about spare ribs together with prawns and a chicken dish which was delightfully laden with lots of chillies and a plate of veggies which was enough for the two of us

staff was attentive enough without being overbearing

i can see how it could easily be a neighbourhood favourite if you are staying inaround ffc, a lot of time we<u+00b4>ve passed looking for a good chinese restaurant right well the best option is here i<u+00b4>ve been in china for 10 years and still one of my shanghai forever favorites try the ziran ribs amazing, dishuidong is a wellestablished hunan restaurant in shanghai very nice assortment of dishes cumin ribs <u+81ea><u+7136><u+6392><u+9aa8> are great but as with most of my favorite dishes there portions get smaller every year

also good are the deepfried shrimp <u+706b><u+7206><u+867e> the familystyle eggplant <u+5bb6><u+5e38><u+8304><u+5b50> and the pickled mountain pepper fried beef <u+91ce><u+5c71><u+6912><u+725b><u+8089><u+4e1d>

if youre a spice lover make sure to tell them as they sometimes tone the flavors down without asking if they think you have the look of someone who does not like spicy food, have eaten here so many timesthe best ribs i have ever tasted the menu is also in english so no surprises
great for a group of friends fast efficient service, it is a chinese restaurant that caters a little to the foreigner pallette without losing flavour in the dishes favourite dishes are kou shui ji shou si bai cai pickled radish la zi ji ding special pork ribs banana fritters been living in shanghai for 8 years and i would vote this restaurant the best chinese restaurant in shanghai we often order too much as there are so many nice dishes its hard to choose
dongping road has a branch but the food there has too much oil and somehow not as tasty as maoming branch
service is better than most chinese restaurants, food is excellent most dishes are quite spicy ribs are musteat location is down to earth service quality is chinese which is not specifically friendly or welcoming but they are quick and you get what you want we come back regularly, sichuan food at its best combined with the enchantment of the french concession it is a must try the ribs spicy but absolutely delicious, although this restaurant is not shanghainese but they do make the best chinese food  if you really like spicy and chilli dont ever miss this place
the ribs are so savoury and rich with flavor and cumin other recomended dish is steam fish head so moistsoftand super spicy
for adventure people do try their stirfry frog legs its really yummy and unforgetable
and for dessert dont miss their deepfried caramel banana yum yum yum, if you like spicy food and great atmosphere you should not skip this place i have been here at least 6x and cant wait to return in the next weeks 
quite reasonable prices large choice of mainly spicy dishes very good rice honestly and i really like the table clothes
traditional place in shanghai  its on the top of my list of shanghai restaurants, this is excellent hunan cuisine well cooked food ingredients fully of chinese and genuine stuff spicy with chillies, we loved every minute we were here twice in two days and were only in beijing for 4

the food here is spicy and i mean spicy the menu is massive with a variety of meat and vegetable dishes

we tried the beans and minced meant the little dried fish the fried chicked with chillies bacon and potatoe the eggplant and more none of it was a miss watch the chillies though as they leave your tongue numb if you go crazy but there are a range of dry and gravy dishes to try

the restaurant is always busy but its pretty big so easy to get a table the staff are efficient and the menu has pictures so its easy to order the food tastes familar so youll scoff it down reasonably prices between 3050rmb a dish makes it a place you can let loose

for me this place is a must go, really delicious food here i loved this place prices were totally reasonable too i saw that some other people said you should make a booking but its a big place and we had no problem either time just walking in  i went in a group of 3 then a group of 4 the eggplant was phenomenal and make sure you save room for the fried banana fritters covered with toffee so good would probably have gone again if id had the time, we had a couple of hours before a late night meeting at the jia jiang hotel so where else to go but dishuidong it was packed as always we went on a tuesday night and it was full so make a reservation in advance but we were promptly seated their staff is so nice and their beer is freezing cold a plus when youre eating such spicy food the jellyfish is so delicious and spicy their amazing ribs are just incredible as were uncles shrimp we also ordered twice cooked pork if youve had it here in the us youve never had it the real way like they make it here

this place has great friendly service great prices and most importantly wonderful food, many friends had recommended and finally made the trip nothing too spicy but certainly not bland right balance so the blend of tastes spice meat vegetable etc were not overpowered highly recommend","cafe",0.999561033785435
26,"quality food  good service clean environment need adjustment to your food they are happy to make adjustment staff usually friendly, i am an australian burger fiend  this is the best burger place in shanghai the beef is high quality australian tasmania beef service is great good beer selection nice fries as well
located right by the ritz carlton on west nanjing road its right in between two metro stops so pick whichever one you like or just get a taxi to ritz carlton, im from los angeles and a burger fanatic one of the best burgers ive ever had quality of meatingredients a+++, if you have enough local food this is great alternative i had black pepper burger which was greatif you like pepper of course
+ chili cheese fries
the place is just a few steps from jingan temple subway station, went there last weekend best burgers in town with great beers just that restaurant is too small may get filled up fast on weekends, nice small diner with a small menue but you will miss nothing on it pricing normal for shanghai
surely we will come again, my girlfriend and me have been there the first time we followed a friends recommendation and it was absolutely worth it nice service personal cool location and most important great food i had the baconcheeseburger with sweet potato fries and my girlfriend had the normal cheeseburger with liberty fries
both burgers were really juicy which we love
will definitely come back, the duck confit christmas special was ok but the bun was much too large and actually greasy some of the fries were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside but probably half were soggy the macaroni bites were underseasoned service was good but there were only two or three other tables occupied when we arrived all in all nothing to write home about we wont make the trek for this meal again maybe we would stop in if we were nearby but probably not, that title might sound like an exaggeration but from a chicago guy that travels a lot and have had my share of burgers its not

the burger was cooked to perfection medium on the inside with a very nice grilled exterior juicy and well seasoned

after all what other burger place has a 1 star michelin rating sorry five guys m burger shake shake game on

and the fries were great too, went there for dinner on a weekday service was prompt despite the place being very busy it is a small restaurant for casual dining can be very noisy and the tables are quite close to one another so you basically can hear the full conversation of the guests at the next table good selections of burger if you are craving for burger then this is the place to go to, a burger specialized restaurant our first choice for burgers in shanghai fries are also very good beer selection is decent the place is clean and relaxed the toilet could be improved a good recommendation for beer and burgers, my third visit too this restaurant love the taste of everything from the bun to the meat its not mcdonalds so expect to pay high scale burger prices worth the detour in the ritz carleton plaza food area, i ate there twice over the weekend and had the peppered burger and fries plus a chocolate milk shake very good burger and fries remember you are in china but the burger is as good as usa my opinion, great food music and atmosphere we had the sliders and chili loaded chips excellent choice and highly recommended if you fancy a break from chinese food, i live very close to this establishment and eat here at least once a month with my young daughter the menu is not very extensive but then it does not need to be  burgers cheeseburgers chicken burgers mini burgers burgers in salad they have a few other items but if you are craving a good burger in shanghai this is a good place to satisfy that craving also good fries  regular or sweet potato they have good indoor and outdoor seating though much more space available outdoors, was expecting a lot better than this the burger was ok but nothing extra the fries were very boring not very crunchy at all have been to a few burger places in shanghai but this one is not one of my favorites, a solid burger restaurant in a relaxed atmosphere limited menu but solid selections good bar selections outdoor seating was nice a good safe choice if you are looking for a break from chinese fare, we visited this place on saturday it wasnt overly crowded but enough to buzz a place it has a great atmosphere an great delicious burgers nice selection of drinks really good service too a really good option to visit on a casual evening, craving a burger and found this cosy place in the shanghai center for a old fashion american burger you can ask for the burger well or medium they had mac and cheese fries as well as sweet potatoes fries salad shakes and beer the place was busy with casuals diners and solos like me all enjoying some burger and chill time, we came here for lunch since my husband was craving a hamburger the menu is varied so youre not limited with choice he had the classic which he said was tasty juicy and just the right size i had the pulled pork and it was good but not amazing the bun was nice and crispy i wouldve liked more slaw the pork had a nice flavour we also tried the sweet potato fries and the regular fries we were happy with both options the service was attentive and fast the location is convenient but not very interesting i didnt give it 5 stars because there is another place in shanghai that i think had a better burger overall, i was looking for a quiet place to chill and catch up with a friend and i was not disappointed the weather was great so we got to sit outside and wait staff was attentive without ignoring us sat at the far corner food wise the selection wasnt too wide which i thought was appropriate for the establishment we had classic burger and a sliders with fries and sweet potato fries  using fresh and good ingredient the drink selection was good and the staff was kind enough to make me a lemon honey drink for my sore throat i was disappointed the lamb burger wasnt on the menu and will come back again for that, spent 6 months in sh for work and i did not spend a week without going to beef  liberty i highly recommend this spot where i can say i have eaten the best burgers i have ever had  and try the ketchup i forgot to take the name of the brand unfortunately , nice burger good atmosphere good service
you can get here by walking around 710 mins from jingan temple, delicious burgers and appetizers bit priceybut thats essentially all of shanghai my boyfriend found the lambo burger to be good but the pulled meat was a bit dry

the staff are amazing very attentive it was busy but we never felt ignored, great location indooroutdoor dining good value pricing for the high rent location simple but good enough atmosphere and service very good fries burgers etc, in my point of view the best burgers in shanghai really a nice place to enjoy delicious burgers with friends , when you found yourself in a burger joint outside of usa the one thing you appreciate is when you actually find good beef in the burgers

this was what we got at the beef and liberty at the shanghai centre a delicious relief with our cheese and bacon burgers done exactly to our degree of medium well

the bun was fresh and the fixins properly layered the extra surprise was the mac and cheese bites fried chunks of breaded mac and cheese different tasty and satisfying

the decor is spartan but has nice outdoor seating the only comment would be id preferred heinz ketchup to what they were serving

all in all a well recommended pitstop to quench that burger crave, a good place for beef burger in shanghai i order a classic burger with medium cook good quality of beef and juicy i love it but the soft drink is too high price rmb 28  coke can next time i may order beer or milkshake instead the service is good, very good burger in the portman complex on the nanjing road made with australian beef decent fries good beer choices with a happy hour deal as well, this is a great place for just a casual relaxing not fancy dinner i sat at the bar service was great the chuck norris chicken burger outstanding and sweet potato fries hot and good they even had wild goose ipa nice casual place where you know what youre eating try it youll like it , i was in need of a decent burger and beef  liberty delivered just that i had the cheese and bacon burger and some regular fries and the chocolate mint milkshake

the burger was a good size well cooked with a good soft bun and decent bacon the fries are thick cut and again pretty good the milkshake was a regular chocolate one but with actual mint leaves in it which weirdly to me tasted less good than when you get the fake mint flavouring but i guess im just a heathen

in total i think it was around 150rmb which is acceptable for a meal of this type the service was good and the staff spoke some english which is always nice

its in a bit of an odd location just off the main street in a hotel complex and the atmosphere is more of the kind of place you come to grab lunch than go for a night out if you fancy a night out with burgers then i recommend fat cow instead as it has a better vibe for the evening, very nice food and at a reasonable price the service was excellent and very quick couldnt fault it, so i came here with my family while we were visiting shanghai and we got to this place from a reccomendation from theburgerguidecom
this place is a great restaurant i mean it actually functions like a restaurant and not like some street food place the burger is done very well and the cheese on top of it is really good moreover i chose the burger with the jalapaneo which also gave some good tastes to the burger
the fries are just perfect
so if you are in shanghai and want to have some good burger meal thats the place, it provides classic burger with a youthful twist it is also most younger people who come here to eat typically a home place the menu is rich and the burger is very good quick serving despite the fact that there are always many people here  not very cheap but worth the money, good western style burgers and cold beer cant go wrong there can you always had great service here and get some of the beverages i am used to at home as well, the burgers were really good just stick to the burgers then its easily 5 stars both the beef and chicken burgers were quite on point juicy but not soggy deliveries from here is quite good as well if you miss a good old american burger this is the place for you, variety of good burgers even tasty falafel burger for vegetarians
nice place for work meetings grub a drink or good western lunch and dinner
reasonable prices in shanghai scale, perhaps because we went on mondays buy 1 get 1 free for burgers  a great price it was very crowded at 930 pm

overall we waited a long time for a waitstaff person to alert us we finally received menus after flagging someone down then it seemed that this was the way you did things  you flagged someone down when you needed something it was quite hot in the restaurant with the doors constantly left open to the outside seating

it was excellent by way of cost but honestly theres got to be better food ask for how you want your burger cooked we did medium well is a 7 and to me it was still too soft inside it equated to more of a medium rare in the us i think it may just be how things are cooked here very cooked on the outside and not so much on the inside

the fries were fine but nothing about it was memorable

its located close to the ritz carlton there is a pizza place next to it  if im in that area again ill try that over this, well i generally say that umami burger or inand out is my favorite i had a great burger yesterday at beef and liberty the contender pale ale from boxing cat was also fantastic i will for sure come back, went here twice during my stay in shanghai the perfect spot for when you just need a burger nothing fancy just a good burger and fries would recommend and would return again, the restaurant is decent looking and has what you would want for casual quick dining

right 3 points this place got for the burger the burger was awesome and the meat really delicious hint they dont know medium as i got a medium rare asking for a medium well i like a medium but as i saw a review i upped it to medium well and it is true they undercook so i was lucky the taste though was spot on and the fries were nice not perfect but nice

now why it loses 2 points
1 some staff were nonchalant not caring and abrupt with their answers
2 the seats are stiff and hard they have some sofas but it would be cool to add pillows or a soft back and seat
3 the milkshakes were so bad for the price 55 rmb i had a chocolate and mint and a strawberry the strawberry tasted of nothing the chocolate was better but still a weak flavour also the milk flavour just was not there i have had a 25 rmb milkshake in hk triple os and is was the best ever uk milkshakes like mcds 15 rmb good but very sweet this was not even rivalling the mcds a shame

it is a bit of a walk from jingang temple subway station say 10 minutes

overall would have got 5 if they nailed the milkshake and service but that blatant ripoff 55 rmb for one of the poorest milkshakes ive had no way with the female waitress being cold and blunt no sir

so id recommend this place if you have cash to burn avoid the milkshakes at all cost that said a great burger the meat is so awesome but needs to be bigger

id return for the burger and the happy hour 2 for 1 beer

okay price

cheese burger 88 rmb
bacon burger 98 rmb

cheapest burger 78 rmb

they also have sides and some other bits and pieces but the burger looked where it is at

beer 30rmb but happy hour 58pm you get 2 so 15rmb each

suitable for friends really work lunch couples fine but not romantic but looks nice, the food was really good first it looked a bit small portion for the eyes but after finishing it it was perfectly satisfying
the service had satisfying english level and they were also friendly
the place has a real western atmospherenice and cosy
i would recommend it, good place for hamburgers they have a vegetarian option falafel burger service is fine youll be charged for every extra sauce you order mayo bbq sauce which tastes mostly like ketchup etc, one of the best burgers ive had so far
we had cheesburgers with fries and some chicken sticks portions are generous

that they only use the best ingredients you taste the difference with every bite<u+2661>

+ very good food
+ tasty milkshakes
+ nice service
+ good atmosphere

indoor ans outdoor seating available, the food here was pretty good and decently priced by shanghai standards my burger was a little undercooked but the milkshake was great and the fries were crispy and wellseasoned service was slow as it often is in china and ended up having to get our own napkins and condiments from the bar outside because none of the waitstaff were responsive if i was to rate this place on food alone it would have a 45 but the service brings it down to just a 3, been here with a friend for lunch the location is nice and you also have the possibility to sit outside

i had two burger the classic and the one with extra cheddar including salad as a sider since also those burger seems this hold true for all burger in shanghai are relatively small i took two the meat was good however the burger far away from better than average especially the bread was a disappointment since it was not handmade and fresh but a bought mass product

already had a much better tasting burger in the city

price is quite high but average if compared with other burger restaurants around, by far one of the best burger in town but recently they changed menu too often why the chili burger it was their most unique and greatest signature burger is not available anymore big disappointment, this is the best burger i ever had  i ordered the chilli one  whith that little jalipino hot pepper  fries was amazing  great place for a quick bite  will add this place to my favorites  hilgly recommended , it is hard to find if you are not form this area just search for the shanghai center and there you will find it near starbucks the place is small around 15 small tables inside and like 10 more outside the burger  fries sweet patatie fries were on top the burger paty from tasmanian cow full bio meat realy tasty the fries were also delicious english speaking waiters nice serving pricea are around 70100burger that is around 15$ but hey shanghai is very expensive for services something like london if not more expensive nevertheless i would visit this place again, a mustvisit for someone in need of a proper burger ashamed to say we visited more than once during our week long visit to shanghai it was just that good definitely recommend","dumpling restaurant",0.99962467592129
27,"had an amazing food experience mixed with some beautiful bulgarian wine will be back for sure with friends colleges and business partners, there is one only bulgaria cuisine restaurant even in china mainland the very golden location metro 2 and 12 and 13 station west nanjing rd is very convenient to arrive the pita is very yummy and it is different with turkish type the side paste is even gorgerous it is mixture with garlic sweet pepper tomato celeryonion and etc after chat with chef mr ivanthe chef mr ivan is typical european because he is very talkable and nice and with grand humor the atmosphere is very welcomedi am recalled my trip in hungry by the typical bulgria suit on the wall because i bought the shirt and vest with the similar easteur type to my daughter next time i wll try famous wine imported from bulgria and other wonderful bulgria cuisine, a must try for their foodalso more convenient to reach the place being near a metro stationits just a few walks away, we have just returned to vancas after too long an absence and we were so delighted to find vancas just as we had the last time just perfect honestly vancas is simply divine  but you must go with an appetite because you want to eat everything on the menu  accompanied of course with the most excellent bulgarian red wine go for the pinot noir  its a perfect match with the meats platter ivan the owner is a marvelous host  he educates you about the menu suggests some new things to try and truly makes you feel like an honored guest he and his team provide a welcoming haven tucked smack in the middle of the busy dagu lu whatever you order you must start with the shopska salad a refreshing mix of cucumbers tomatoes and a generous portion of yummy light cheese on top incredible good value for the money too and dishes are perfect for sharing atmosphere is inviting comfortable tables in an elegant and warm happy place  the kind of place to try new things enjoy an evening with friends and family  and perhaps meet some new friends too be sure to make reservations in advance highly highly recommend, classic east european with lots of good meat and some great wine
go there for a quiet evening expect to come back sated and happy, having been to vancas several times and again after a long absence from the city i finally distilled the taste of the place down to a few words vancas is comfort food

in shanghai having varied cuisines from within and outside of china in shanghai having dozens and more excellent restaurants a visit to vancas is like a visit to the neighbors at home familiar yet still different but above all is the comfort food you remember from home

any of the sausages mixed grill or minced meats are very good the snow white salad remains a necessity and visiting vancas without having the baked sea bass is not a full visit eating at vancas no matter what culture you come from no matter what language you spoke when young is reminiscent of the tastes and feelings you had when young eating at home you may now approach the table with mature experienced taste have dinner with wines and in foreign places but sometimes no matter where you are a place gives a meal which give you a comforting feeling

that is comfort food and that is had at vancas, we had a party of 10 friends all going out to eat they had a section in the upper level of the restaurant prepared for us we showed up a bit early but they were all set up and waiting

the food was great i loved the ribs and loved the sausages all made by the owner himself we ordered a ton of dishes and all ate more family style the chicken cordon bleu was a bit dry so i wouldnt get that again but the other dishes were great

i was a great little spot that was perfect for a night out with friends very reasonably priced with great service, i went to there with a group of ten people and we had our first rose juice the servers are really kind and the food were delicious especially the steak ribs, one of my shanghai favorites great food big potions and fantastic service had the naan with feta cheese the white snow salad yougurt and cucumber which is so wonderful and the ribs had no room for dessert geared toward westerners but prices are fair i will be coming back  so many good things to try and the rakkia bulgarian brandy was a nice touch at the end of the dinner, we visited vancas on a friday evening and are very pleased with the restaurant we ordered ribs snow white duck with salad and nuts everything tasted wonderful i recommend this restaurant highly, my wife and i found this place several months ago and since weve never had bulgarian food decided to give it a try all i can say is that we were not disappointed been back there 6 or 8 times in the past year sometimes with friends or just for a date night and its always on the list when friendsfamily come to visit is in shanghai stuffed cabbage is delicious the ribs and pork knuckle are eat with a fork tender and he makes several different sausages that are great weve seen people out a suckling pig which looked awesome we also enjoyed the bulgarian red wines but thats another story

lastly dont leave without trying his homemade yogurt in an appetizer or dessert or even on its own we buy a couple tubs to take home for breakfast throughout the week, great place for dinner and drinks try the ribs and the snow white they are the best ivan is also wonderful welcomed with a smile and treated like family, vancas wonderful home style cooking is expressed through some of their signature dishes

 mouthwatering best in shanghai so far spare ribs tenderly cooked in a homemade sauce
 bulgarias authentic and unique shopska salad cucumbers feta cheese and tomatoes plus a secret dressing
 amazing stuffed cabbage leafs with minced meat marinated in deliciouslyflavoured marinade
 the musttry mixed grill consisting of grilled meat marinaded overnight in vancas homemade grill mix superb
 the delicious yoghurt salad
 best best best yoghurt produced on the premises

of course a great variety of wines and other alcohols makes the visit wellworth the ownerchefmastermind greets personally all guests and suggests the dishes and wines based on each individuals taste and preferences

bravo vanca, this unique place is a must go for all the people who like good food
i have been several time and the food in excellent and reasonable prices
suggestion give a try to the grilled fish is the best in shanghai, easy to find on dagu lu this little bulgarian restaurant is home to the best ribs and mixed grill in shanghai and we have tried many i would also recomend the cheese pita for starter although portions are very generous so you will need a good appetite my favourite thing is however the home made sausage i have found sausages in shanghai always a little disappointing and was apprehensive when i ordered but they were amazing the portions large and meat heavy over all very good value

the staff are all friendly with good understanding of the menu both food and drink we were not sure what to expect from bulgarian food but i now have every high expectations, i�ve been looking at this place on line for quite a while and finally got around to trying it out tonight i was very pleased that i did it was quite when i got there shortly after they opened and i seated my self toward the back of a small cozy downstairs dining room menus soon delivered and a cool belgian duvel ordered as i went over the menu to start i had of the best cucumber soups i�ve ever had along with some feta cheese pita wedges it was a filling appetizer at the suggestion of my host i went with a mixed grill of homemade sausages and grilled chicken each was delicious in its own way this is a pretty place in a vibrant downtown setting friendly folks and a good value for sure, after a drink on dagu lu we headed to the bulgarian restaurant  vancas the owner ivan suggested we start with a typical salad with feta cheese and a mix of yoghurt and cucumbers salad he recommended we try the pinot noir from chateau burgozone this wine was fruity and with a full body an excellent compromise between a french and new world pinot for the main course we took the fish for half the table and the famous spare ribs confident on the wine choice we ordered the chardonnay and the cabernet sauvignon from chateau burgozone both wines were complex well balanced and a perfect combination with the food we loved so much the wines that even bought some to organise a blind tasting and surprise our friends  + home made food excellent wines  no outside sitting, delicious dinner this evening  we especially enjoyed the seabass the mixed grill and of course the ribs all washed down with a great bottle of pinot noir our first visit  vanca we will be back bulgarian cuisine on dagu lu is a must thank you, in live with vancas advice everyone to go and take ribs cheese pita and salads made with love and homemade yogurt  very nice personnel great food and service, before posting my own comments i was curious and so looked to the previous ten and found universal praise and agreement this is a great restaurant in shanghai and would be a great restaurant anywhere

what to order the snow white salad three scoops of a yogurtbased salad with a slight tang made more delicious by knowing all yogurt is made in house by chef ivan then try the zelevi or cabbage rolls with again generous dollops of yogurt on top follow if you will the chefs recommendations  he wont lead you astray and in a few moments youll appreciate his friendly sincerity  but do do do order the baked sea bass accompany this with bulgarian wine i didnt know bulgaria boasted 152 wineries and produced 175000000 litres last year red or white but the white is especially good and finish with a lemonyogurt mousse yes i also am not overly fond of desserts but this this was simply fine

this was our second dinner at vancas but this time with a chinese friend who gave unqualified praise to the meal and chef ivan so i would recommend this especially for dinner with chinese friends who may have great experience of western cuisine but dinner at vancas will prove a notable experience chef ivan also offers rose petal jam at 28rmb each jarful i buy one for each diner at the end of the meal as a takehome gift because again it is unique

how can i say it the food and wine is simply great no exaggeration just a due and true compliment no matter dining alone as a couple or with friends or business associates vancas will not disappoint, lovely late dinner featuring premium bulgarian wines especially liked the shopska salad vancas was half full thet eveing and so chef ivan had time to chat with us and tell us more about bulgarian cuisine and culture we loved it, ivan very generously organised a pig for our group and looking after us very well company and food was delicious will definitely be back next time we are in shanghai , as a bulgarian i have been craving kebapcheta white cheese with cucumbers and tomatoes and liutenica since i arrived in china i have to say that vancas satisfies those cravings but not by being entirely bulgarian but by being more of a twist the only trouble is that his liutenica isnt as good as that of my granny but i knew that would be the case the owner is very friendly and we had a long chat about bulgarians abroad i can only recommend this place and i am very happy that it is in the top 50 places to eat in shanghai, you have to go to this place if you are in shanghai the price is good the staff is nice we eat pork ribs 148 rmb for a big bite the bb sauce is homemade not as strong as the american kind i could also recommend the bulgarian wine worth a visit, nice barbecue everything was fresh and perfectly cooked the excellent accompanying sauces secvolete eat great bbq with great service ill be back , i ate very well and i felt like it was home i recommend everyone to try bulgarian cuisine is very good and something different for those who have never eaten, in quality and quantity tremendous four of us put away 2 orders of doublecheese pita very cheesy with great garlicky redpeppery sauce and spicytangy spicy green peppers a salad cheesy and delicious 2 mixed grills the sausages are zesty and have that kofte type texture the chicken pattytype is spicy a pork knuckle this is more for the fattymeat lover and the ribs the ribs are so tendera show stealer we drank two excellent bottle of pinot noir the owner is very friendly and made us feel like longtime customers not first timers the combination of quality quantity and warm hospitality makes this pace a mustgo, this restaurant has a warm atmosphere owner is very pleasant and dishes are so delicious i recommend everybody to try this bolgarian food, in my opinion one of the top 2 restaurants in shanghai december 2015 was my most recent visit to vancas i have had dinner at vancas several times in the past 2 12 years and the food and wine has never been better the owner and a chef himself ivan makes new guests feel like they are old time customers and regular customers like close family friends the pork ribs were delicious and the sponska salad and cheese pita were delicious as usual ivan has very good bulgarian wines that he recommends if you like red wines i strongly recommend trying bulgarian wines recommended by ivan i have had wine at vancas as good as some of the best reds from california or france, this is by far one of the best meals you will have in shanghai
everything is amazing from the owner ivan to the succulent ribs pork knuckle
and dont leave without trying the melt in your mouth cabbage rolls

no matter what you choose you cant go wrong enjoy

youll be back, what a pleasant surprise we received a warm welcome from the owner who recommended some amazing bulgarian food the sausages that are made by the owner himself who is a professional chef were delicious definitely try the mix grill and plum brandy, wed never had bulgarian before and figured that shanghai was the place to do it nice family style atmosphere with great music the staff are extremely attentive and welcoming try the ribs, while traveling in shanghai i was taken to vancas never having experienced bulgarian cuisine before i was both excited and a tad nervous for the experience

vancas offered the best dinner i had while in shanghai

we had a sampling of items off the menu and took the recommendation of adding the ribs which are a total must have
the service team are very friendly and are multilanguage speakers so ordering was very easy for our english speaking party
the owner ivan visited our table and made some suggestions of wine to match our entree selections ill say some of the best wine ive ever enjoyed paired with our delicious meal
ivan is very hospitable and quickly becomes a good friend making you feel at home in his restaurant
i look forward to retuning for dinner over my stay and in future visits
i would highly recommend you visit when you find yourself in shanghai, we had a very wet cold day out yesterday and decided to try vancas for the first time to warm us up excellent decision we ordered the famous ribs and a lamb dish as well so good with red wine if you want tasty supertender meat creamy mash and vegetables this is the place for you, visited vancas for the first time and it certainly wont be the last amazingly good slow cooked meats we were greeted and well looked after by owner ivan and his staff as we were about to look over themenu ivan made his recommendations pork knuckle bbq ribs salad  cheese pita  plus a wine reccomendation my advice go with his reccomendations all of these dishes were outstanding he knows the best he has to offer i guess this is why this small unassuming restaurant is so highly rated if you like meat this is a should not miss place to visit, menu is quite poor if you dont eat pork the only meal you can order is grilled salmon 98rmb and cheese bread which is really yummy 30rmb all the rest of food is just pork pork inside of chicken pork inside of beef but if you like pork that would be the right place for you as bbq is good, great wine excellent food good atmosphere great selection of foods to complement the selection of wined plenty if spirits if your into that clean toilets good layout, we were the only guests and wondering why it was so highly ranked in tripadvisor the food tasted homemade and the favors was great we tried many different dishes and all good the owner was also very nice talking with us and told us his story about the restaurant, we went with friends who raved about ivan and his tremendous bulgarian food we were not disappointed ivan was a great host the ribs were excellent and fell off the bone we also had the pork knuckle wit potatoes and sauerkraut which was outstanding the stuffed cabbage was also wonderful you should also try the homemade yogurt great treat, only the one bulgarian restaurant in shanghaiand as always on hi levelthe food is excelentwith taste of bulgarian traditional home made dishesi have been several times there and never disapointedowner is all the time availableand will advice you for the best wine or food selectionthere are available wines from bulgarian producersand i may say they are excelent toomusic is well choosen and not noisly as usal in other shanghai places, ive been to this restaurant at least 10 times and have never been disappointed the atmosphere quality and service is on point ivan the owner is always available to give you suggestions on wine pairings or just help you decide what might be the right dish for you the location is small and cozy and is an ideal date spot or a good place to just meet with friends and have a nice dinner the prices are overall are reasonable and the portions are good, vancas is a bulgarian restaurant in the heart of shanghai
what i enjoyed is the very authentic food that tastes just like the genuine style in europe
ivan the host and head chef is a great guy who does his best to ensure his customers are happy and enjoy their meal
the ambience and music finishes the enjoyment of eating at vancas
i highly recommend eating at this restaurant, the food was wonderful pleasant ambiance and lovely people the restaurant is located close to metro which makes it easy to access the food has a real authentic taste and the place is very clan and tidy, if you know bulgarian cuisine or balkan food in general then stop in at vancas if youre in shanghai i go every time my travels take me to the city and the restaurant never disappoints can honestly say that vancas is the absolute best after living in bulgaria for several years and dining at bulgarian restaurants in the us

had delicious suckling pig beans with homemade sausage and other great dishes on my last visit would suggest calling ahead for the pig to ensure that its available

the owner ivan loves to cook and satisfy his customers and the restaurant is in a great location with a friendly atmosphere inside and out, food was nice but was expected something more wow especially ribs i will go back to try again cause maybe bot good day, if you are looking for a place where spice marry the food in the way you can enjoy every flavor please come to this place the food is just delicate in every sense, nice diner good atmosphere the owner is friendly and takes the time for a chat he is very proud about aboutaboyt bulbulgaria, the ribs at vancas were good very easy to eat and the mashed potatoes matched the taste of the ribs the restaurant wasnt very busy at dinnertime furthermore was te service alright, great and friendly owner and staff my friends loved the food i thought it was a bit plain but the ambience more than makes up for it, vanca is one of our favourite restaurants in shanghai the ribs is to die for one portion is big enough to share between 2 persons the sponska salad is equally good ivan the owner cum chef is very hospitable and go all the way out to assist in recommending the dishes and the wines price wise  value for money we will definitely go back again and again","bar",0.914041436536099

you have to visit the best japanese restaurant in shanghai, probably the most gorgeous venue in shanghai
the food japanese is great too but a bit above average prices, i come now for ten years to shanghai and one of my constant things is the shintori restaurant so many things changes so quick in shanghai but the shintori was 10 years ago a cool high quality japanese restaurant and it is still today, this is more than a restaurant you are entering a work of art the kitchen is on the ground floor at the back whilst the dining area is around the mezzanine level looking down on the kitchen and ground floor the food is superb and service is great this is a showcase restaurant if you want to impress, i went there with a friend of mine and i found everything amazing beginning from the location the architecture itself the interior design the furniture and of course the food i loved everything on that restaurant i did not pay so i cannot say anything on that issue, 6 of us ate  one vegetarian who was well catered for  on a wed night and it was full book in advance the design of the place the service the range and quality of food and the ambiance are all excellent, astonishing interiors great service best sushi experience ever
its the perfect place to impress your diners
what else, this is one of my favorite japanese restaurant in town great food amazing atmosphere this time the service was not too quality, superb japanese food very big list we tried as many as possible and couldnt find one that wasnt excellent the place is also great very trendy great experience in shanghai, i had not been here for 8 years but after i can concluded the quality of food and ambiance is still the same, the ambiance is great with the open kitchen and nice lighting walking through the bamboo corridor and into the reception it creates a romantic feel the presentation is wonderful and the sushi is very good the duck spring rolls and the halibut we very tasty spend the little extra money and enjoy some excellent innovative food, not so easy to findits directly at the street corner in a kind of hidden entrance great interior very trendy place open kitchen good service the fish is fresh loved the sashimi pricey but definitely worth it, we felt like japanese and i didnt want to go to far did a quick search on trip advisor and found shintori
at first we walked straight past the entry but then doubled back and noticed it you walk down a bamboo lined path that leads to the entry the interior is quite spectacular we were seated upstairs with a great view of the kitchen the device was pleasant and professional we both started with a beer and shared the entree of scallops that was delicious then we both choose the main course sushi as well as sake the sushi was excellent im looking forward to going back again before i return home, located in an old theater this modern restaurant hosts some of the tastiest dishes from japan fresh ingredients and fast service makes sure this is a visit to remember however the open area also makes this a somewhat noisy restaurant, this is more of a theatre than a restaurant the main part of the seating is on a gallery above the open kitchen so you can see everything being prepared it is a bit overpriced but the starters are generously sized  we enjoyed the wasabi chicken salad and an amazing squid salad which wasnt really a salad at all

we had a huge plate of mixed tempura which was awful but they did remove it from the bill, a very good japanese option in downtown puxi the kitchen seems super clean and you could watch everything clearly with no doubt their sushi is one of the best and one of the most expensive in town but recommend to ones who likes a real good sushi, the janpanese style restaurant offers an open kitchen you can sit on the kitchen level or one fly of stairs up you overlook the open kitchen food is pricy but very good good mix between cold and hot platters try the sushi  extremely good , behind an unmarked entrance a path leads to a door behind the door is an amazing japanese restaurant called shintori it was probably one of the best japanese food experiences ive had in shanghai unfortunately as there were 7 of us they could only offer us a private room which im not a fan of  i like to enjoy the ambience of a restaurant however the restaurant has very high ceilings and a big empty atrium type of design in the middle which gives it a rather cold and empty feeling so perhaps it was for the best they tried to be trendy with the waterfall restrooms gents and you couldnt tell if you were wading through waterfall splash or something else which was a bit offputting the food was superb though and would highly recommend it, if youre looking for a super modern clean esthetic this is your place the keiseki meal was superb it does change seasonly food is a bit pricey but once youre inside you understand why this place is just great the fish is fresh and the saki menu is phenomenal, a great place for delicious japanese food

you can easily miss it as there is no sign on the street and at night it is a bit uneasy to find

the sushimi are wonderful presentation perfect and so so fresh
loved the duck rolls
on the other hand i was not impressed with the beef rolls

the decoration is very minimalist with good taste and i suggest you take a little sweater in case you are seated under the huge ac

a few deserts in case you are still hungry, better the people restaurant this one is always stylish but with less flavour and ambient
food is a mix of asian and western with an original research, very cool hip place in great neighborhood sushi was fresh very expensive for shanghai standards but very good and unique space massive old wharehouse service was fine no sign outside follow bamboo path off street, business dinner with a big group very modern japanese the waiting time was just right great food quality sophisticated and well presented, the dim lighting the space and the buzz make it a cool place to dine your mind can chose to be anywhere you fancy we chose the chef menu and werent let down, good food very nice location inside factory building renovated but really expensive good for special events but nothing for a quick dinner with family, i have been going to this restaurant for the past 13 years the quality and the taste were always there the atmosphere is very interesting since build in an old factorywarehouse a good reference, fantastic place not to be missed if you like japanese food
the place itself is gorgeous if you like modern architecture the sashimi and sushis were a delight a bit on the expensive side but definitely worth it, had to take a client out last night
visited the shintori site and read an amazing very recent review
on the strength of this booked dinner the writer was a superb fiction artist the dinner we had was ok not bad but nowhere near the 3  rating the author had written now in retrospect realized the review was planted i feel totally tricked presumably by the owners this restaurant is okgood but thats it please dont get conned too, a friend an expatriate living in shanghai from london for 6 months suggested this wonderful destination restaurant we were totally impressed with prompting and a helpful shopkeeper on fumin road we found the restaurant with minimal confusion the three of us enjoyed the kaiseki course meal which is new each month it is a 7 course meal with an additional prelude and interlude we added the rock and roll salad which all three of us agreed was a wonderful treat in addition the staff was very helpful but discrete in their attentiveness although we sat on the upper level overlooking the kitchen preparation area which was a real treat we were too busy enjoying the meal to have our attention diverted downstairs to the preparation area, over priced small portions  was at sushi bar chef not very communicative

service poor 

at sushi bar everything dropped onto serving plate infront of you  doesnt look good  had a lot better in shanghai , if you are in to japanese food this restaurant doesnt really leave much more to wish for the food is fresh and good the service is excellent and the atmosphere exciting, great japanese restaurant with open central kitchen the courses are well treated high quality of meat and fish
the attention at the wine level in the glasses could be improved, i must admitthe prices are way higher than what they should be however the food is really really good and worth paying that much more also the warehouse sort of concept for the venue is quite cool
good for business dinners or solo or couples

definitely going back again, team had craving for japanese while in shanghai and received recommendation for shintoriso satisfied best japanese food weve found in sha, amazing there is really not much more to say amazing setting amazing layout amazing food better every time i return i can not recommend shintori highly enough, as a business traveler i ate out a lot in shanghai my favorite food is japanese shintori scores high on all points location � easy to reach via metro 5 min walk from jing�an line 7 exit 9 and close to jing�an and french concession hotels wow factor  a secret intheknow bamboo entrance paired with an expansive open kitchen spacious interior ambiance � cool modern quiet although it is an open floor plan the lighting creates intimate spaces so you can be seen but you aren�t on view and conversation is with those at your table not the ones around you for a large group the 20 person table in the middle of the restaurant makes your private party feel private but also in the spotlight and they didnt hassle me for prepaying selecting food or coming with the exact amount of people like many other restaurants do i came with well under 20 people but we still had the entire table food � high quality fish beautiful and creative kaiseki dishes kaiseki menu changes monthly good drink menu cost � not overly expensive but pricey which means a certain level of clientele ive never seen children here service � excellent especially janice good for date night business meal or celebrations, founded by a taiwanese former mathematics teacher who is also owner of the restaurant people 7 and of the ceramic shop spin shintori is a spacey restaurant used to be a movie theatre with excellent service and great japanese food being on my way between home and office i have been here hundreds of times and i was always more than happy with food service and environment dark light splendid flower compositions artistic presentation of each plate
i have brought many visitors here and everyone was impressed, we went with the 3 children to this japanese restaurant it is a big factory hall with 2 floors on the first floor is the kitchen and some tables on the first floor are also tables from which you can look down to the kitchen
they gave us a table right above the kitchen so the kids had a good view on how the food was being prepared they really liked it
the place is big and has some kind of james bond atmosphere
the food is good very small portions and very expensive
but it was a nice experience, i found this on the recommendation of one of the locals and when we first got out of the cab i was sure that we were in the wrong place this place is hiddenwe went between some building and started seeing bamboo and then these really heavy wood doors with motion sensorsomg inside is the best sushi i have ever hadfancy interior a+ presentation if you are in shanghai you have to go here it is an experience, shintori is a beautiful restaurant you have to go just to see it the food of course is really good not the best japanese food i have had but its way above average
7510, this japanese restaurant is a must try i went there twice during my last stay in shanghai
it is a little difficult to find but already when you enter the restaurant it gives you a nice feeling
atmosphere is just amazing the service is great and the food is really really lovely, good food in very special location open kichen and sushi bar very friendly and competent personel and looks very clean i can recommend, i like it so much that i had dinner there twice the same week as there is no sign board outside and as you have to go through a little path surrounded by bamboos it looks like you go into a secret placethen the door opens and you arrive in an industrial chic area stunning space you really have space there if you are seated on the mezzanine then you will have a full view on the opened kitchen all the japanese cuisines classics are offered in the menu fresh and tasty are the two words to describe what you eat at shintori the food is delicious i really enjoyed their sushis and sashimis special mention for the foie gras sushi also try their soft shell crab marinated with mustard a delice, what a restaurant excellent resemblance with new york very hip and trendy fresh food great menu, excellent japanese restaurant in shanghai hard to find as no door sign nor any indication of a restaurant inside it is a very large loft style restaurant where you can get amazing japanese food i wont say more just go and enjoy, not only the best japanese in shanghai its also the best restaurant in the jingan area so if youre staying at the jingan shangrila or hilton hotels then eat here tucked away down a narrow lantern lit alley off julu road near the intersection with fuming road the entrance is impressive the room is a converted industrial building with a large floor space surrounded by a mezzanine platform the food is excellent with all varieties of japanese specialities and you can watch the huge cooking crew at work from the mezzanine the toilet signs are totally inscrutable and cause a lot of amused consternation for chinese and foreigners alike but thats part of the fun highly recommended, my business colleagues took me here for dinner i am not a fan of japanese food and was reluctant to go eating sushi in china so i had a great burger at my hotel before i went what a mistake the sashimi was so fresh and the other dishes that we ordered were tasty and full of flavour the service was great people had a smile on their faces and they we there when we need them the only draw back was the bill which was a bit of a shock will return on an empty stomach","dumpling restaurant",0.829358981976154
29,"during a short visit to shanghai i visited this nice restaurant for and early dinner with a colleague  it had been recommended by an old friend of mine who lives in shanghai

i must say i was impressed many great small tasty dishes and some of them were unusual combinations but with great flavours we only had the smaller tapas dishes and did actually not order a main course  the smoked aubergine and the tuna belly were fantastic however all was good there was also a good selection of wine even the wine per glass was very good service was a little bit slow however still very friendly

the restaurant is on the 5th floor of a building on the bund there are no obvious signs for the restaurant on the ground floor and it can be a bit difficult to find if you dont know where to look i will definitely come back if in shanghai again, main reason to go here is the location and view looking out across the river to pudong you catch a glimpse of this futuristic picture of the world food is tasty every dish was nice top drawer wine list was a little limited staff are polite and professional maybe just not enough of them service is good whenever they come around but theyre not likely to ever approach your table or check on you unless you call them over they forgot a couple of our orders but no problem we were full they made it up to us by offering a giant beautiful dessert for free
management own another place just off of nanjing road near maoming road named tomatito, decent spanish restaurant tapas bar overall very good but there were also some misses with the tapas, came here for weekend fine dining brunch and it was superb especially love the egg course as i had the poached eggs with foie gras absolutely decadent i would love to have foie for breakfast from now on, i have been here several times and always enjoy it they also help my wife who needs to be gluten free with excellent food

last night i took a group of colleagues from work a mixed bunch of european chinese and indian the indian guy was vegetarian

all commented on how good the food was a truly great experience, i love to come here with family friends colleges and business partners beautiful sexy tapas and an amazing choose on wines amazing view and lovely staff my favorite for ever, booked a table for two for me and my girlfriend for valentines day special valentines menu looked great although pricey at nearly 1000rmb

she cannot eat dairy and i had checked several times in advance that this would not be a problem mentioning it both on the online booking and calling in advance

service and quality of the first few courses was excellent however we were then forgotten about for around an hour before our last two courses when these arrived they were seriously disappointing steak was tough and the cod that was subbed in for my partners meal  apparently they struggle to make steak and potatoes dairy free  was bland

no apologies or concessions were made to for our wait

lastly instead of the shared glamorous desert we were given an unadorned fruit salad this was pleasant but not good enough for the price we paid

wines were good and the room pleasant we could have had a great time but felt let down in the end, me and my girlfriend went here for dinner at 7pm over cny restaurant was not busy and we were seated with great view seats we ordered drinks from probably one of the most unsmiling energetic waiters a tall chinese gent that i have had since living in shanghai for 5 years the drinks came out albeit a bit slow considering very light occupancy and were mixed well and very fresh we ordered a vegetarian mix that was steamed in a plastic bag once again delivered by a very unfriendly waitress and the veggies were quite good our next plate was a shrimp with garlic and although the shrimp were nice size and seasoned well they were seriously overcooked and not very appetizing unfortunately as this could have been a great plate we had ordered a sliced beef and also a short rib when the waitress came back with next plate if was obviously short rib and the waitress proclaimed it as the wagyu beef plate my girlfriend queried her in mandarin to double check and she obviously didnt know the appearance of the food which was pretty shocking the beef plate was delivered next and unfortunately both of these the meat quality was horrible very stringy and low grade meat i understands the fat content should be nicely marbled but having traveled all over asia for my position and spending significant time and experience with wagyu this in my opinion was definitely not that source and at best was low grade australian and likely simply chinese beef both of these dishes were so poor that we left them both uneaten and for my girlfriend who is local shanghainese to leave food on plate that is something that never happens the waiter and waitress that dropped food were very unfriendly never once checked on how things were and this restaurant is seriously overpriced considering the overall experience and living in china my expectations for fantastic service experience are adjusted for the region so for me to say that the service was worse than normally seen in shanghai that pretty much tells you how disappointing it was as my level of expectation is already low compared to western service it is unfortunate and surprising given some of the ratings but just too many data points to confirm and sway our experience to quite negative as a note to the chain of restaurants we frequent lelephante multiple times a year and the service atmosphere and food quality is always consistent and significantly differentiated from our experience at el willy we dined at 01feb evening dinner time, have only been moving in shanghai for a couple months but i can already say this is my favorite restaurant its a bit pricy but foodwise is totally worth it they offer a lunch menu with a few starters and mains to choose from every dish is carefully presented and combining diferentes flavors they have a salmon with cream appetizer that is delicious and i had the best dessert ever it was a lime sorbet with basil and lemon crustomg delicious the venue has great views to the bund which adds to the experience must try, ate here in january 17 with a friend
service was very good available when needed but not on top of you all of the time
we ate a few tapas for a starter with some freshly baked bread and a paella dish shared for the main
the food flowed from the kitchen at a very well managed pace hopefully by design  we were neither flooded nor starved
a very interesting menu we could have ordered a lot more would recommend highly reserve in advance and get a table by the window for some fantastic views of the bund, spanish tapas in china why not wonderful atmosphere in this very popular restaurant great views of the pudong skyline if you are lucky enough to get a table close to the windows
the dutch chef served us a surprise menu of some truly excellent tapas very innovative original blend of flavours and beautiful presentation ask them to take it slowly and allow yourself enough time to savour each dish, the 5th storey setting delivers an excellent view of the bund and the pudong skyline the delicious tapas is complimented by brilliant service and a great atmosphere there is a very broad range of food that suits all demands including a large vegetarian and vegan menu also the dessert menu has a giant platter that offers a wide array of tasty desserts that between 5 we couldnt finish  but is still recommended, my first visit and my first impression were not as positive as this last experience perhaps an off night for both of us but i must say my recent meal at elwilly was superb spanish food with great imagination wonderful presentation and flavor that never stops

if you like spanish and dont mind paying a bit more for the view which is spectacular then try this place enjoy, very good spanish restaurant in shanghai
atmosphere is very good and view is superb even if is not easy to get a table next to the bund windows
menu is very good, 5th floor restaurant overlooking the bund waterfront you can either get there by taxi or take the subway exit 1 at yuyuan gardens station and walk 800m food is delish we asked for the chefs menu so we got a taste of many dishes on the pricy side for shanghai 800rmb per couple but worth it, the atmosphere in the restaurant is great the view is amazing and despise all the groups there its surprisingly unloud i think this the type of restaurant that fits both occasions romantic dinner or festive evening with a group of friends

my husband and i were on a romantic date and we had a lovely view on the bund we decided to order the surprise menu which happened to be quite expensive compared to what you can get in other restaurants almost 100 euros per each

anyway as i am pregnant before we ordered we asked for a menu without somked salmon or raw food the waitress spoke good english and told us it was no problem but we eventually found out that they didnt change anything to the menu planned which i can understand but i would have liked to be noticed because it wasnt pleasant at all to be told repeatedly along with the plates coming on the table oh you cant have thatand you cant have that all the best food were things i couldnt have at least this is what my husband claims

the food was good sometimes very good but basically it wasnt amazing again for this price also i would recommend to the staff that some basics of spanish tapas should be brought along like bravas and not only experimental yet interesting food

the wait was very long between plates which i can understand as it is a tapas restaurant and when youre with friends you dont really care

suddenly our waitress disappeared and we ended up with waiters who didnt speak english we told them weve been waiting during 30mn for the dessert and that were in a hurry because we had to go back to our daughter the guy said ok and 20 mn later we were still waiting we decided to ask for the bill without having dessert and again no one would understand we wanted to pay even when we showed our credit card

eventually exceeded my husband stood up and the waitress immediately the device to pay we were really angry the evening ended this way because it was all perfect

to sum up the location is great the food is good but the prices are way above the quality and the staff could use some english lessons as a lot of the customers were foreigners we wont come back , this restaurant was recommended to us by by manager at otto e mezzo another excellent restaurant in shanghai and we were not disappointed we were offered chefs selection of tapas for dinner and this turned out to be a truly memorable experience of dining in shanghai sea urchin tapas just melted in the mouth and were better than anything i had in japan or elsewhere same for lightly marinated tuna in avocado tapas every dish was presented as a piece of art and was full of flavour one minor problem we encountered was that the range of flavours and tastes was so vast that no single wine could possibly match all of the courses we had we selected red spanish wine before we knew what the chef will offer but the first few courses were seafood and fish  not a great match for our choice of the wine
nevertheless we had a great time and really enjoyed the experience
ask to be seated at the window  the view of the river and pudong is amazing, have eaten here twice in three days had to go back because the first visit was so good a real buzz to the place and the food is just outstanding order from the menu but dont be afraid to ask for the specials or something a little off piste and they will assist where they can the food is melt in the mouth good and comes out at just the right pace to enjoy it and leave feeling full but not bloated try and get a window seat if possible and enjoy the bund views highly recommended, great views from the 5th floor food was as good as the views good wine selection service was excellent, place is great very simple and cozy ambience food is good but a lot of elements what dont belong to spanish cuisine oh well lets call it fusion if you want still food flavors are good presentation is very innovative portions are sufficient for to be called tapas very good experience, this place offers excellent spanish food with quite amodern touch original tasty and very interesting the atmosphere is great the service excellent and the views stunning it is a place to enjoy the night in shanghai and near excellent bars for the drinks afterwards, the atmosphere in el willy it is really nice elegant and cozy at the same time when you book ask a table to the window because of the great vue on the bund i came differents and i always went back home full and satisfied the food is nice a right combination for fusion and spanish the tapas are so delicious especially the salmon one with truffle oil i love the fact that the staff is super friendly and always there to help for being in such a exclusive location the wine carte is also fairly reasonable in prices with really good wines

i would suggest this place, great location and superb food
not only mediterranean style also kind of japanese fusion with the smoked salmon appetizers on a fried filled puffa real explosion of different tastes in your mouth
perfect food on a very high level and no standard though price according to quality and location higher but this is okay
this is your place for a romantic dinner or business dinnerdont forget to book in advance
staff polite and professional only negative the receptionist on the phonearrogant and not helpful at all more than once, i would not have spotted this restaurant without being directed here not very visible from street but i have made sure i will find my way back now located on 2nd or 3rd floor facing the bund you get a nice view if you have reserved your table in time pre reservation is highly recommended funny interior and modern fresh and tasty dishes served by kind and talkative personnel, if youre looking for a break from chinese food this is a very good option i was just visiting the city so felt a bit odd going out for spanish cuisine in shanghai but was very pleasantly surprised the food was excellent very impressive in fact it was better than most of the food ive had actually in spain, world class food with great service and wonderful view of the shanghai skyline with every visit to el willy you are in for a real treat its one of my absolute favourite restaurants not only in shanghai but anywhere, trying to take tapas to the next level elwilly has a great location and comfortable absence the food while different and unique presentations of typical tapas dishes is fresh and flavorful the price however reminds you that you are on the bund in terms of value the combination doesnt work there are other spanish restaurants which provide the same level of flavor and presentation but not the view so if its view you want then elwilly is the right place, this is one of my favorite brunches in shanghai im just surprised it never seems to make it on to the best brunch lists and doesnt seem to be fully booked

the deal is you order 5 dishes each for around 200rmb add free flow cava for 100rmb you can order paella but costs an additional 100rmb i think this is great value especially considering the location which is a superb bund view

all of the dishes are tasty and well presented they are served 2 or 3 at a time some may say the dishes are too small  but this is the concept of tapas if you want more of a dish then order 2, we liked this restaurant  thought it had good food and enjoyed having tapas after many asian and french type meals over the prior weeks also think the pricing was decent for a western type restaurant 6 plates 2 cocktails and a jug of sangria for $100 its a fun atmosphere as well, went here as part of a business invite certainly based on the line up for those without bookings this is a popular spot everything that suited my preferences was tasty and fresh and the service was pretty good, after questioning a few people on the street we found out the restaurant was upstairs we ended up arriving a little later for dinner but they accommodated us anyway the options on the menu all read very well and we ended up trying a few different tapas not the cheapest place around but the food was great the service really good as well only criticism the dessert ordered was called a doughnut but was actually ice cream coated in coloured chocolate and nothing that would be associated with a doughnut tasty but a bit misleading, what a cracking restaurant hidden away on the 5th floor of no 22 zhongshan dong er road

the building itself is magnificent with lots of interesting galleries and other eateries

elwilly is a spanish tapas bar with a great fixed price lunch menu or a wider a la carte choice they also have some fantastic wines

the place is stylish with some great music interesting decor and the view across the river in shanghai is superb

a great choice for a relaxed lunch or dinner, i am an extremely gluten sensitive celiac living in shanghai this year eating out has proved extremely tough came to eat here due to being unable to cook one night and went for the leave it to us feast for two an wobbly start when we were served the normal bruschettalike appetizer so stressed that while i knew i could not eat it we did not want to have anything brought to the table that contained glutenfrom there on in it was a culinary delight wide range of exquisitely presented items every mouthful delicious
it is certainly not a budget meal out but as an unexpected splurge it could not have been better, no visit to shanghai would be complete without a visit to this restaurantproviding youve saved up your pennies as it wont be a cheap bite to eat

one of the biggest selling points is the great views across the bund and if this is one of your primary reasons for going then i would suggest you book well in advance and reserve a table by one of the windows

i found the service to be relatively good by shanghai standards and had no problem getting served swiftly ordering or otherwise

we ordered a wide range of dishes ranging from slow cooked pork to a simple bowl of olives the food was hot delicious and very well presented its just a shame that the portion sizes are so tiny for the price you pay

and there lies the achilles heel of this particular restaurant for me it fails to deliver any kind of value and whilst a great place to meet friends for a quick drink and a very small snack its not the place to go if youre hungry

for two adults we paid circa 1200rmb say <u+00a3>120 or $160us for one bottle of wine and our food its rare that i leave a restaurant hungry but this is one of those occasions

this is not a bad restaurant by any means but i would not return by choice, quite simply the best restaurant in shanghai food is divine bread fresh out of the oven scallops were the best thing i have ever tasted and on a bed of guacamole prawns delicious cant remember the name of the dish i got it was minced meat and cheese but my was it delicious this was a breath of fresh air and rare for shanghai where most western food restaurants are style over substance and food is average this restaurant was different because not only was the view impressive but they had food and drink to match i would recommend this to anyone and it is somewhere i look forward to visiting on my return to shanghai, one of my favorite spanish restaurants outside spain located on the bund with a gorgeous view on the financial district in pudong  great place to entertain guests out of town recommend gazpacho refreshingly cold tomato soup home made goose liver pate beef tartar served on a bone with marrow crispy suckling pig and red prawn paella nice wine list with matching wines at reasonable prices, we had dinner here with our colleagues the service is very good and the atmosphere is for grownups with loud music and dim lights dont take kids here food was delicious especially the rice dishes i didnt find the tapas mind blowing though
the sangria could use a little stronger flavor and the toilet is hard to find especially if you had too many drinks, the portion of the tapas are way too small compare what i paid i did have few experience in the other spanish or tapas restaurant in shanghai but in elwilly theres no value especially the waiters never take the inetiative to pour the wine we had to ask for it and the empty plates were sitting at the table until the dinner finished, a business associate took me here and he told me that this was his most favorite restaurant in shanghai the place was situated on the 5th floor of an old building nicely redone when we arrived on the 5th floor the restaurant seemed unconventional because of the way it is laid out i dont want to ruin the surprise so wont say much i guess that was the best part of the experinece i am not easily impressed because i have had my share of excellent dining venues but this was definitely one of the best dinner experience i have had

i am rating it a 4 because the service was cold and just did not complement the place here in el willy it is the place and food that will create loyalty

the best part was the selection of tapas and how well they were executed portions are small but enough so that 2 people can share an order easily everything was absolutely delicious  the salmon with honey and cream cheese in a bread puff the suckling pig and the mixed dessert also the the squid was amazing

the place was nicely arranged artful ambience with interesting table grouping there were tables by the window and corner tables that was cozy and comfortable visit the restrooms because they were quite interesting

the view from our table was excellent it was spectacular to see the shanghai skyline the changing building lights and the boats cruising on the river the experience was soothing and exciting at the same time and features the spirit of the city

the only negative was the service host was unfriendly the service staff was cold and seemed forced staff did not recommend anything nor cared if we ordered anything just complete blah

the only person who even bothered to smile at us was isabel hopefully her warmth is contagious enough for the rest of the staff at our next visit, i was truly looking forward to another visit food was good but the service absolutely terrible drinks orders mixed up food didnt arrive until reminded worst of all bill arrived and tried to move me from table before the food service was complete and only an hour after my arrival i know i was a solo diner but this was completely unacceptable, went for lunch to elwilly just the two of us it is very populair with our friends at the moment we had some trouble finding it with the addres stated here on tripadvisor it is on the i believe 5th floor of an old building on the bund on the ground floor they sell evening dresses we didnt have any reservation and we were lucky to get a table at the window if you want to be certain of a seat at the window you should make a reservation it is nice to have a seat at the window as you have a nice view over the river and the skyline the restaurant doesnt have a terras after we arrived two big groups arrived for lunch as well which made us wait for a long time for our food when it arrived it was good ordered 4 different dishestapas tortillas beef skewers gazpacho which surprised us because it is warm and more like a seafood soup and the squid sandwiches with a coffee and a glass of wine we payed around rmb500 it was well worth the visit had a nice lunch, definitely one of the best dinners we have had in shanghai so far the tapas were so delicious we could barely stop portions are so that each person can order between two to three tapas

everything was absolutely delicious but some of my favorites were the salmon with honey and cream cheese in a bread puff the suckling pig and the mixed dessert although i have to say that it was incredible how soft and tender the squid was

service was really great all the waiters and waitresses were super friendly and advised us on how much we should order

i hope to definitely come back, such a wonderful location with high quality authentic spanish cooking we cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough but would suggest booking to ensure a
well positioned table to fully enjoy the view, el willy has an excellent location food is good even though i dont find it unique however i recommend this place for the courtesy and the elegant mood, the meal was great my brother and i especially loved the steak go for dinner because the view of the bund is incredible, an amazing spanish restaurant in china

with a awesome view over the bund in shanghai

the food you can chose whatever you like because everything ia great

higly recommendable, great tapas restaurant in a nice location overlooking the bund excellent food and wines pretty good service too good meet, we were shocked it was such a good restaurant from traditional gazpacho to short ribs and an assortment of tiny portions of desserts great service was excellent paella superb little pulled pork tacos great foie gras lovely building beyond belief 5th floor would go back in a heartbeat, i must be honest i wasnt expecting much out of a spanish restaurant in china im quite diffident on ethnic restaurants outside their home country instead ive been surprised by the quality of food the choice and the whole environmentatmosphere usually ethnic restaurants in foreign countries always keep something of the local tastes in their preparations this was not the case and it really seemed to be eating in some place in madrid or barcelona   in the end i would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to take a break from oriental cuisine or just looking for something different for a dinner out, had dinner here but wouldnt say it left a lasting impression the salmon tapas was probably the best dish we had food was reasonably priced","Indian cuisine",0.999666269881984
3,"great place for drinks to end the night the views from the rooftop is one of the best of shanghai nights service is good as well so a must go venue, what an amazing venue located on the 58th floor of the ritzcarlton you find yourself amidst plenty of stylish people at one of the hot spots in town excellent view onto the oriental pearl tv tower  youll never get closer to it  and the bund at the other side of the huangpu shanghai is one of the most vibrant citys on the globe  and you literally feel it at this place food is good nice selection of drinks but what really caught me is the atmosphere of that place underpinned by an excellent dj set attentive staff and the whole city in front of you a must go, lovely views  great interior good spot to entertain but not so much for a quiet conversation glad i went though, this was my second stop in shanghai financial district it was much better than the place i wont name in a taller tower it was nice and all but didnt have the life and energy that flair offered great service from bar staff from the manager who spoke great english to the the woman training her first night very friendly and welcoming although it was feb and cold the view from the outdoor patio i guess was tremendous i only had some bar snacks but they were great ill be there next time im in shanghai wish i could remember the managers name all i can say is he asked me to mention my time there shei shei, surprisingly very bad service at the ritz slow and forgetful coming from someone who often stays at the ritz, definitely one of the best view in sghai over the bund better going when its warm enough avoid december to march to enjoy the terrace although being next to that fire place is really cool its pricey but if you think you deserve a treat or you get someone you want to impress then thats a sure win equivalent to the peninsula bar id say but with more cachet
may sure you book particularly from thursday to sat otherwise no hope, at the rooftop of ritzcarlton pudong and the only one outdoor view for the shanghai city at pudong side one of the mustgo place for tourists , been here couple of times the view amaze me every time downing the waitress provided great service with good music and nice drinks pricey but worth it, +fantastic alfresco rooftop venue for a drink or two and the view is todiefor
+grab a seat at the bar counter to see the sushi chefs and bartenders at work
+kudos to the male bartender for being super attentive to details
+cocktails are surprisingly good
+food quality is generally very good

no reservation for nonhotel guests really
not cheap, fantastic drinks  view great spot to finish your day here with your business partner or colleagues your visitors or friends since my first visit a few months ago i come back often to share this great feeling with others perhaps the prices are slightly more expensive but other roof terraces require entrance fees and ultimately the quality and ambiance is not the same excellent flair, it was getting late when i arrived at the hotel so i wanted to eat at the hotel the flair was still open and i thought we would enjoy the view as well so up we went not only was the view remarkable the bund the river the night lights of pudong etc but the service was excellent they tried hard to satisfy my vegetarian needs although they dont have many choices i had vegetarian sushi roll and soup while we enjoyed the view it was quite cold outside 35f but i went out on the terrace for a short time anyway for photos what a view, the view is amazing it was my first trip to shanghai and i would not have missed it

ambiance is a little afterbusinesshours style not very cosy 3 beers were 300rmb quite overpriced

i would not come back a nicetoseeforonetime but when ppl ask me for a great view of the city and have a drink i would advice this place, she made our evening go from great to perfect food and drinks was awesome based on her recommendations perfect english

thanks, great service and view vicky and downing were attentive and helpful celebrated a birthday and they made it very welcoming and friendly, we called same day to make reservation and when we arrived the place was almost empty we asked the host if we could sit a table beside the window but was told they were all reserved  but till we left those tables were still empty and nobdy told us we could change our seat although we clearly told them to do so for a place which charge 10 service charge in shanghai they should give you some service if also additionally when you are also charging premium prices for the drinks and some simple snacks despite the nice view, walk into this resturant and of course it is hotel guest can make reservations if your not staying here then take your chance

yes it is expensive it is a hotel resturant what do you expect

everyone in here wants to be posh it is a ritz carlton after all

the food not so good it is a fusion of some sort the menu confuses you on what they really want to be

the view is amazing but overall more geared for tourists, i was attending a conference at the hotel and had a chance to meet up with a friend living in shanghai he suggested the rooftop bar at the ritzcarlton we were fortunate to get a table next to the window but noticed most of the tables were reserved i would suggest making reservations if you plan going there allinall a great experience and great service, one of shanghais polished gems cocktails were made to perfection complementing the world class view and great music frank the manager delivers quality service with character and professionalism the perfect evening thank you, flair have a beautiful environment service enthusiasmalex  downing are beautiful and warm girls, the good view good drinkdelicious foodalex and downing provide good service btythey both beautiful^^, came here a few years ago when it just opened and had a terrible experience all i can say now is that it has completely changed the staff members are friendly and attentive one person in particular is frank he has been an excellent addition to the flair bar in shanghai hes friendly outgoing and very professional also makes great drinks you just have to ask him the view at this place is also great but make sure to come before 10pm lights turn off at exactly 10pm and make a reservation in advance during the weekends definitely one of my favorite hotel bars to go to in shanghai now, the first time i came to flair was for my birthday with friends we had some drinks and enjoyed the open doors seating with an amazing view photos cant do it justice the service is excellent the drinks tasty yet pricey but completely justified and the atmosphere incredible one of my friends also had food and it looked delicious the only thing that annoys me about especially the american hotels in china is that they always add a service charge 10 i think in the ritz to your bill i love this bar for a special evening and am looking forward to returning soon, nice cocktails and very helpful staff the view is mainly on oriental tower two sections with one being a restaurant and second a more cozy area to relax would recommend for a classy drink but not necessarily for the view, we popped into flair for a drink had heard of it from a few friends and thought wed give it a try thank you to dowling and ian for making our night better by giving us a comfortable window table, the food was soso nothing id write home about or on tripadvisor but the views you get are amazing the place has a cozy intimate feel and staff was very nice and helpful, ive been here twice and both had great times drinks were good with and without alcohol
i dont want to compliment the view since its already so well known
the staff here can speak fluently english and provide great recommendations so dont hesitate to reach out to them for advice
last but not the least id like to express my sincere gratitude to the waitress named alice she was professional and served us well we didnt know a drinks name except a photo however she recognized that and told us the name of the drink she also chatted with us about things to do in shanghai
overall nothing to complain definitely will visit next time in shanghai its a perfect place for business escape and friends reunion, located on the 58th floor at the ritzcarlton shanghai in pudong the flair offers a wide range of drinks and snacks with breathtaking views

friendly staff and bartender recommend some great signature cocktails to suit your taste

advanced reservation is essential
recommended bar to chill out when visiting shanghai, i will tell you that the restaurant was good and the night scenery was beautiful the food was good and the people spoke good english and very polite if i had to add the shanghai airport to this review it would drop to a half of one very awful and i never want to experience a airport like that again thank god for the restaurant saving our loves and making up for the piss poor airport, great vibes great view great service
its definitely a busy bar in shanghai but all the servers are extremely friendly and attentive they literally made sure our glasses are filled the whole time special thanks to frank for making our fist visit to shanghai so memorable, we had such a great night at flair the view over the bund is amazing thank you frank for the hospitality, we absolutely enjoyed the vibes at flair nothing is better having drinks with friends and accompanied by the stunning view of the bund very impressive 5star services by the team especially frank he made our night, was there in october at friday night with my business partners great view and adorable cocktails food can be better for this pricesushi was not so tasty also good music pretty female dj she make real cool atmosphere , really enjoyed our diner at flair amazing view great food nice music and a very friendly helpful waitress alice highly recommended, we had an amazing time at the bar we arrive without a reservation and within 5 minutes we were sat the bartender came to great us and knew our names it was our anniversary and several of them congratulated us which was a special touch the drinks were good but the atmosphere and view are spectacular expect to pay ritz price but it is worth it we were waited by dave from korea he was so nice and attentive they made sure our experience was great this is definitely a must in shanghai, last night was my first time visiting flair during winter at first i wasnt too sure how it would be since i usually always go during summer and sit outside however i was not disappointed by the service at all i had the pleasure to be served by frank whom i presume to be the on duty manager or captain he was extremely helpful he learnt that i was craving a frangelico sour although they didnt have frangelico in stock at the bar he created a cocktail that tasted just like it this in my opinion is quality 5 star hotel service giving a client that unexpected wow factor he was also great with the wine recommendations my friends and i were also very satisfied with the service received from our waitress alex
one thing that would have made my evening perfect is if the heating was more strong or if they had heated lamps it was terribly cold even with a fur coat on moreover it was really warm on the right side of flair where the bathrooms are located i found it a bit odd how big the heating difference is i would love to be back during summer or once they come up with a solution for the cold, what a place breath taking view super cocktails charming service and great food i was impressed by the level of detail the staff goes into every staff member engaged the guests so well music was an added plus the place was buzzing and the vibe is great if in shanghai do not miss this, flair lives up to its name  frank and his team are passionate about providing the best drinks and the best service the music is good and the crowd is provocative most people will post about the view and that is without a doubt spectacular but lest we forget  this is a team of hard working enthusiastic creative bar men and women who create an experience which dramatically exceeds that which we might expect from this sort of a wellendowed venue, awesome views of shanghai from the rooftop bar and great food and drinks music creates a great atmosphere late night, got flair recommended and paid a visit received a superb service from downing guan along with some tasty intriguing cocktails never tasted before, this is the best bar i have visited in shanghai and sherry and johnny are awesome and really helpful, best view in shanghai  great place to finish off the night at the ritz carlton  lovely bites too  and a great hostess downing , great view great drinks and great food our server linda was very helpful despite the language barrier on our part, spectacular views outstanding drinks as well as excellent and friendly service by alice and merlot nice mixed crowd of locals and foreign travelers combined with the ritzcarlton style outstanding, flair rooftop bar is located in the shanghai pudong ritzcarltonit is the highest bar in shanghai nowwhich means you can enjoy the night view around the shanghai btw the view is so amazing for meyou can find asian cuisine in this bar if you want to eat somethingthe waiter and waitress here are very polite and helpfulvictoria is a nice waitress she introduced many places of interest in shanghai for mein generalit is an unforgettable trip for me in china, when you come to shanghai the marvelous city you really need come this place to view the night of shanghai we are so lucky to have dinner outside on the rooftop terracethe service is quite good and environment is graceful especially the one of waitress called graceisreally nice and attentive but not overpowering she is very take care of us we are fully enjoy to have dinner in flair literally cannot faulthing and i cannot wait to return, one of the best rooftop bars ive ever visited its a bit pricey but definitely worth it my colleagues said that the gin and tonic was the best one they ever had i agree it could be a little bit cheaper 9 euros for a peroni beer but i would go there again and again and again, had cocktails and some snacks here recently and i have to say its been a wonderful experience the rooftop is breath taking sushi and oysters were very tasty our waitress alex was very attentive and satisfied every requested we had me and my friends are quite demanding costumers will definitely come back when in shanghai, enjoyed some fizz here after dinner in the jin xuan chinese downstairs the bar is quite trendy with music and subdued lighting to enhance the amazing rooftop views across downtown shanghai excellent service which included a delicious complementary tray of fresh fruit there is rooftop seating outside for warmer evenings and great photo opportunities, the view is gret only the entrance staff is not really nice when you`re not staying in the ritz carlton as a resident they leave better tables free for hotel guests good if you are sad if you`re not and have to sit next to empty tables with them much bette view, flair was among the must go places so there i went in my first ever trip to shanghai the experience was quite something relative to my experiences at an upscale bar in asia i was lucky to meet sam xiao who is a lively and wellread local who was able to tell a story for every drink i asked for this was a unique experience of my shanghai experience as a result i came back to stay at the hotel this time back in shanghai definitely a must go for any visitor to shanghai","bar",0.999733238815853
30,"my nephews wife treated me to this restaurant for late lunch on one friday afternoon after our lunch time yoga class

we ordered the salads which was freshly made

i ordered the chicken caesar salad and she ordered the parson meat with couscous

i tried her salad which was really refreshing and tasted totally opposite to that of mine

if you want a healthy change from chinese food this will be the restaurant to go to

the waiter was very attentive and chased out of the restaurant soon after we left as i left my pure yoga water bottle there at the table, what to say is the best on his kind i miss to eat there since i moved best dish is the hummus but also other dishes are great too keep it up, we went in a large group the service went  all those who ordered 1 type of food received that then a long wait before the 2nd type of food etc we had people at our table that were finished their food long before the final people received theirs also another table that arrived well after we had received their food of the same that we ordered first as we continued waiting  they hadnt even finished their appetizer when we received it not very good, was attracted by the menu and entered the restaurant did not want to sit at the bar was seated outside in the mall area in a closed section despite empty tables inside other guests placing themselves in this section were asked to go inside got a menu card then no waiter showed up anymore left disappointed, this is a westernstyle restaurant that uses fresh ingredients and has all very healthy dishes if you are in shanghai for an extended period of time and want a refreshing salad or sandwich this is the best place to go highly recommend i wish there was one in the usa, great salads and weekend all day breakfasts element fresh have been experimenting with their menu to be honest the new choices can be hit and miss not sure the lina tag is worth that much go with the tried and trusted big american classic cobb the new winter soup is good too, i used to love a lot element fresh but we are disappinted at our last 3 visits each visit the salads were bland and not that tasty the meat comes with the salads were chewy the pastas were too much boiled lost its texture and even became soggy this is from a very long time customer almost from the very first days of element fresh consept start pay attention to your kitchen, great place for salads  quesadillas and smoothies sandwiches arent really worth the price not overly impressed with the steak sandwich element fresh also varies depending which branch you go to nanjing west road is one of the best in my opinion overall quite costly but when you have a feeling for something fresh no better place in china, fresh and good try it
from fresh juices and sandwiches its all good and tasty quick bites to eat and convenient to shopping and walking for the rest of your day healthy good convenient food, my date and i visited and truly enjoyed the experience we had the caribbean salad a salmon sandwich seafood miso starter soup and fresh juices and smoothies every single item was delicious all the ingredients were fresh the salad crunchy the shrimp in the soup  yummmm  and the juices clearly prepared following order would highly recommend prices are also pretty decent for its location in pricey shanghai, healthy is normally boring however this place has a very creative menu good service with english speaking personnel you want cleanse your body or just have a bite to eat then chose from the food choices yolo so eat healthy this time, easy healthy western food in china if you are vegan you can easily alter the dishes to be suitable and something for everyone makes a nice change to most of the restaurants you come across, a very nice quaint little vegetarian restaurant nestle in downtown manette opened in sept it was raining and this was the perfect little cozy place to have a quiet meal and conversation the service was excellent our server was very personable our food was delish the wine that was recommended was very good as well everything was top notch i would highly recommend the nightshade restaurant they also serve brunch on the weekends i looked at their menu and will try it everything looked great lots of choices, great healthy spot we stopped at for lunch loved the many choices of fresh juices and we all really enjoyed our lunches, was not easy to find american style breakfast in shanghai this place actually had decent bacon and eggs pancakes and coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice
you will pay for it though, we often go to element fresh there are several and they all give a good meal the sandwiches are great quality and the salads are so wonderful there juices are fresh pressed and their cheese cake is absolutely divine for our family we recommend it over every single other restaurant in shanghai that is how much we like it the one at xujiahua has nice out door seating that is a bit protected and at a very nice mall the grand gateway, decided to have a healthy evening meal at element fresh and was presently surprised about menu choices as it had the good selection of healthy salads pressed juices as well as main meats  fish dishes i had the warm tuna nicoise salad and you must try the mocha pagoda on the desert menu, good food with nice outdoor table seating its just next to shanggrila hotel which makes it so convenient will definitely go back when im back in shanghai, there are several of this chain in sh they care clean and comfortable and the service is ok what you get though is an easy menu to read with pictures and a multiple choice of both asian and western dishes the prices are reasonable for sh element safe is a fresh bet, the restaurant offers healthy meal options

they offer a wide variety of salads and juices the menu is in english and personnel can communicate as well in english so it is great for tourists

i liked a lot the laffa bread salad and watermelon juice

it is very clean and the personnel is very nice i found it also not expensive

very good option for a healthy dinner in central shanghai, safee bet for those less adventurous about local chinese food selections great salads and healthy menu, very good clean food safe and free from allergens very tasty and healthy plenty choice good quality and value for money, for living in shanghai for many years i have no reproch to do to ef but it became now really expensive salads are amazing in terms of quality  quantity but other dishes are a bit low in quantity, we went to the element fresh at portman nanjing road the food was average the attention not good because they were too late to bring the beberages and the timing of the food was very bad, good selection of salad and healthy options on offer a favorite dinning spot whilst i am in the city with good and consistent quality the service is probably a miss and hit and avoid the 12pm lunch time rush either head there earlier later or make a reservation, food is very mediocre some dishes come even out of the microwave i guess then how can it be fresh and healthy the recipes are nice and mouth watering but what you get on the table isnt prices rather high for the quality you get, salads are hard to come by in shanghai element fresh has some good ones the cobb salad is a winner, we used to visit here years ago when we lived in shanghaiand great to see its still there and actually hasnt changed much went 3 times during weeks stay across the courtyard at the portman good breakfast and two nice evening meals try the seafood and vegetables in the outdoor dining spacegreat for seeing shanghai start to light up even got to renew my loyalty card will be back, perfect for when you have that where are we going to eat questions among your group element fresh has pretty much everything in terms of western cuisine and a great kids menu free wifi is also a nice touch, nice restaurant the menu is also in english so its helpful and they definitely portray themselves as a healthy eating place however i personally think the food was average and i didnt like any of the salads their pastas were also not that great if you want to go there for the juice theres also a juice stand nearby i guess if you want to grab a quick and safe lunch you can check it out but dont expect anything exciting in terms of taste, this is a great place healthy food and delicious the prices are good and you can get great deals in salads fruit juices and healthy snacks however they also have main dishes very well prepared and the restaurant ambient is calm and nice kind people and english speaking definitely nice place to go solo or in family try it, good for vegetarians  good food  good service  very fresh  and tasty food  customers who came with me from thailand also happy , i tried their drinks if i am honest they have a really light flavour and heavy price they cost so much for chinese price and have such a light flavour they must be making a lot of profit, since this is close to my hotel i alway eat here to try different food and to save a bit of money a nice chain with decent and clean food with a nice relaxing environment good selection of food and friendly staff, the first time i tried to go to an element fresh was some 10 years ago in shanghai and it was upstairs in some building i could not find now there are many in major cities in china and no wonder this is one of those businesses that in my opinion does everything right well as much as humanly possible menu is excellent  varied and healthy if you choose cocktails are delish you can come here for breakfast lunch dinner or just a snack and feel like you just flew to la dont expect gourmet fare but do expect to leave happy, great international food
you can have western food chinese mediterranean etc
prices are not cheap but the quality is excellent

service is generally quick, i have been in shanghai a week i have experienced all sorts of traditional foods from dumplings to eel to fish to duck blood soup so im not a sheltered traveler i went shopping at the big super brands mall and happened into this restaurant that looks like it was plucked from the century city mall in los angeles and dropped down here a huge selection of fresh salads sandwiches smoothies and simple dishes some chinese influence but mostly felt greenvegetariantype i had a salad with carrots beets pumpkin seeds olives a crazy mix of veggies that was incredible as an american i need a good salad or light meal some times and this hit the spot, we love everything about element fresh we enjoy their wide variety of healthy food and we like to come back any time be it for breakfast brunch lunch or dinner, i went for a work lunch here during my visit to shanghai i ordered a salad which was rather sumptuous and also a fresh carrot juice i particularly liked the place firstly given the number of veggie options across different cuisines  asian thai continental service was pretty quick and quite a large restaurant so you dont have to wait even during the shanghai rush hours, i love to try new foods and especially new cuisines however 2 years living in shanghai leaves me yearning for fresh healthy food produce especially i probably come here once every two weeks but its a bit pricey they do have a happy hour for selected drinks  not everything which is buy one get one a bonus if youre thirsty and a rewards program which upon last look my status would be increased if i spent 3000$usd

yes dollars so the rewards program could use some revision they change the menu seasonally here which is something to look forward to on the frigid days of spring but disappointing if you have a favourite item that becomes no longer available

among residents its known for being overpriced for what you get but sometimes the only easy and consistent alternative for yummy and healthy most people have a favourite dish or two i find dishes either surprisingly delicious or generally average but always pricey otherwisethrow caution to the wind and get some dumplings around the corner for under $2

i always bring guests here if they get tapped out on the local cuisine or cant handle it in general the summer cobb steak salad is a favourite of mine as is the salmon salad and chicken apple sandwich too but only if youre in the right season 

hopefully the blueberry apple fusion tea stays on the menu

buen provecho, element fresh is clean and warm environment  their menu is reach and offer variable choices for healthy lovers as well service is good and welcoming atmosphere, great concept for the shanghai eater what they do they do right good healthy wholesome fresh food service could be a little bit better but not bad for a great snack, having visited shanghai quite a few times this is one of our favorite restaurants because we feel comfortable eating fresh fruits and vegetables here and have never gotten sick from doing so this is the first time we visited element fresh on west nanjing road it is two stories and located in an upscale mall their menu has primarily western foodbreakfasts were delicious and my sister had a chopped salad which was so good that she had it again a few days later it is worth making the effort to try to find one of their many locations, saw the nice promotion screen out of my hotel the food was good service is slow but still can say it was better than the service what i had in hongkong the female hostess is very nice sorry i didnt notice her name, element fresh has been one of my favorite places to have brunch in shanghai the service is always good the food fresh and the prices great the juices are a must try and so are the salads i would recommend element fresh for brunch andor a lunch in between shopping after visiting more than 4 of the elements around shanghai a big plus is the consistency in quality and service they keep in all of them, a chain of similar places light modern decor and a varied menu with salads sandwiches and a wide range of chinese and asian insplired modern dishes i have always had good experiences here and it is a favorite when i want a small western meal, nice place for lunch very fresh ingredients the turkey club with avocado was really good also have a nice selection of smoothie drinks, i go here often for lunch or dinner when im craving for something western the quality of the food is good and the service is okay not everyone speaks english but ive always gotten what ive ordered they also have a happy hour, its been months and they still show in the menu options that they dont carry anymore service is bad but same as other places the coffee quality is really bad in summary you would come here because you have no choice but leaves a lot to be desired, its gotten a bit pricey in recent years but i think that is partly due to high rents in the snazzy areas they pick certainly the locations are all well chosen and nicely done up food is reasonable but the salads are not as healthy as they seem and several times i have had some dodgy old leaves mixed in portions are big though

juices and juice combinations offered are delicious but just too expensive if you consider all the other alternatives out there","Chinese cuisine",0.726438397800598
31,"it was our first meal in shangai we were very hungry and upon entering we could smell the scents of some really good food we had the hot and sour soup  very good we also tried a couple of exotic dishes that were interesting  the jellyfish and crispy river eel the eel had a sweet taste i probably would rather order a noodle dish or wonton soup the next time if you want to add some hot sauce you may have to gesture for a few minutes until they understand what you want or do what i did  i took a picture of a small dish of chili sauce the waiters at the next eatery recognized it immediately

we all shared glasses of tiger beer and tsing tao beer i usually love a good san diego ipa however the chinese beers are lighter and seem to go best with the cuisine

shanghai grandmother is a short walk from the bund, its always a little hard going to local not catering to tourists restaurants in china when you dont speak or read the language but this place was great their menu had pictures of almost everything and english descriptions below the chinese the very nice server didnt speak english but was easily able to communicate that they were out of braised short ribs and that she recommended a different beef dish than my second choice which turned out to be outstanding food came out quickly and 3 dishes with two large beer came to 160 rmb cheap its in a perfect location for tourists but packed with locals highly recommended, went there for dinner on our first night as it was close to our hotel westin  were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food they have a menu in chinese with english translation  pictures of the food so we were able to order quite easily

the restaurant is always busy  packed with locals always a good sign  but we were attended to promptly a couple of staff members do speak a few words of english but not much
highly recommend the kungpao chicken the celery with lily buds  the minced vegetable with tofu
the food was so good we went back on our last night , many locals are eating there clean with nice atmosphere convenient to the bund great value for the price, went for dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food bustle of the place and prices given that the restaurant is near ground zero tourism i was expecting to be shaken over but this was not the case

the dishes vary from rmb 20 to around 70 and eating on my own with two dishes a juice and coffee was the princely sum of rmb 108  not bad for sit down restaurant dinning

the service is fast and robust and the food very tasty if you wanted to ease into shanghai cooking i think the grandmother would be a good place to start as the menu is very wide with plenty of vegetarian options  as well as bull frog and turtle if you want to hit the bucket list, nice chinese restaurant around the corner from jinjiang metropolo hotel classiq in shanghai where we were staying good food low prices cheap beer, in search of some vegetarian food i was pleasantly surprised by some of grandmothers dishes such as braised aubergines in soya sauce delicious
it was not busy when i arrived around 2 pm and serving staff was not too animated which gave the whole place a somewhat limp feeling price is right, we were at captains bar just across the street but we wanted chinese food and we ended up here has all your favourite shanghai dishes and the prices are reasonable was really busy for a monday night and with decent food and good prices you can see why, we went to shanghai grandmother late so we only had 45 mins but the service here is quick and efficient the food was fine  and amazing value comparatively for the area this is set up like a diner and loads of locals use it so that shows you how good it is i have only given it a 3 star not 4 because my personal preference is for a bit more comfort if you are looking for good food at great prices then this is the place for you, still jet lagged and tired from an overnight flight from london we stumbled on this place at 9pm on a friday night

we recognised the name from ta and guide books and just decided to try it glad we did as it felt like a family and local restaurant good choice of food served very quickly only downside was that it shut at 930pm thats very strange to us

but the food was good  we chose beef noodles a chicken dish lots of bones  and rice for 2rmb yes 25p or 35 cents

its not a destination for tablecloth dining but even 5 days later  we thought it an excellent choice, <u+6211><u+662f><u+5728><u+7535><u+89c6><u+4e0a><u+770b><u+5230><u+8fd9><u+5bb6><u+5e97><u+7684><u+7535><u+89c6><u+91cc><u+4ecb><u+7ecd><u+8bf4><u+8fd9><u+5bb6><u+5e97><u+5728><u+5404><u+5927><u+65c5><u+6e38><u+4ecb><u+7ecd><u+4e66><u+4e0a><u+90fd><u+6709><u+63a8><u+8350><u+3002>

i heard this restaurant on tv it says its recommended by many tourism books so i tried it with a friend from beijing i went there at about 8 pm and it was full i waited about 15mins and got a table then i ordered some traditional shanghai cuisine
as a local i can say the food is below average people knows that sugar is an important ingrdient in shanghai cuisine and its totally right but the food here are too sweet tthere are sugars but too much i cant belive its the taste of shanghai and finally we wasted a lot the rate of this restaurant is over average because of its location so the cp ratio is very low which results a very bad experience for me
i recommend you try something else if you are travelling in shanghai, its highly recommend for all types of visitors ive been to shanghai many times but try this restaurant first time since now theres an english with pictures menu which is very good for nonlocal the taste is quite stronger than other chinese restaurants that ive tried before in shanghai also the staffs are helpful and be gentle this place is not far from the bund after you finish you may go for a night walk at the bund which could create a memorable time spent in shanghai, when you enter to the place you will feel the very local atmosphere the menu provide a wide varieties of food with pictures which is very good for visitor like us and the taste quite strong and tent to sweet nice choice, i stay here several times
there is lot of choice and easy to understand for foreings with the menu pictures typical chinise and shanghai food but not extreme the service is really fast and dishes are generally good
price is low 300 yuan for 3 considering the bund area and places nearby this offer one dish at this price
they understand quite easily english even if sometime cames out with hilarious wording weiters are always kindly during service strange you ask for towels you need to spend 1 yuan
say that the quite low rating is due to one hair found inside one dishonly one timeit could happenbut they need to pay attention and right countermeasure, the extensive menu made it easy for us to accommodate a wide range of palettes  from those of us interested to try bullfrog turtle and tripe to those who wanted to stick to the familiar cashew nut chicken turned out the braised pork was the winner the portions were more filling than anticipated we definitely over ordered but enjoyed sampling from the six different dishes the night we ate there was a long wait and almost no tourists discounting those from other regions within china we would happily dine there again, walked past this place while exploring the bund and was able to make a reservation to come back later in the day nice atmosphere good service food better than average but nothing special worth a stop if you are looking for an easy place to eat near the bund, i found it hard to beleive the previous reveiws as the food was terrible the service was friendly enough and prices appeared very cheap but when trying the food its overpriced

you will find many better places much better local to this area

hate to be negative but its as we found it, this place was close to where we were staying so the reviews didnt seem too badthought why not
the first dish arrived and was chicken you could clearly see was raw and had visible blood no way were going to eat that so they laughed between themselved and took it away it returned a short time later after being in deep fryer  only half the chicken and just as unappetizing we had ordered 6 dishes as they eere cheaply priced only one dish was edible the braised pork in brown sauce albeit 75 pork fat the crispy fish still had bones after being told it wouldnt

nothing else to say apart from be careful as raw chicken can kill you or atleast make you sick in a place that could be risky at best, this restaurant was recommended by a friend of mine the food was honestly mediocre

the food is essentially what you would expect in most shanghainese restaurants the variety of food offered is pretty wide and the flavour is decent the dishes were lacking in portion

i think this place is a bit pricey for what it offers in food but it is very important to note that compared to other restaurants that offer similar level of food at a lower price will not be as clean

if youre looking for a restaurant for local cuisine and a clean environment i think this is a no brainer especially with family or those who cant stand restaurants that are a bit run down

the food is priced above average in comparison to other restaurants in shanghai the restaurant is usually visited by tourists when i was there most of the customers were clearly not locals, yummy food  definitely get the ribs a note that this is cash only up front we loved the eggplant as well which was suggested in other tripadvisor reviews service was fine and they definitely spoke english it was nice to see a mix of tourists and locals eating there they close somewhat early on weeknights so make sure you check the time before you go it was conveniently located about an 8 minute walk from nanjiang rd where we were staying, nice food and not too expensive do note that they only accept unionpay credit card not visa not master not amex etc so have ready cash for your meal, great restaurant stumbled upon it on trip advisor and lonely planet so decided to check it out during my long weekend at shanghai did not regret it  actually i ended up going there twice this weekend as the food was delicious actually it was the best meal ive had during my 2 weeks in china

upon my first visit i just had the 3cup chicken  delicious yummy and everything i wished for and more today i went there again and had the braised pork + fried noodles  mouthwatering could not be happier the service is great the food is amazing and what i really enjoyed is the fact that most people here are locals so you dont need to fear ending up into a touristy restaurant here good value for money cheap  midrange depending on point of view

be prepared to wait for a table though  book in advance if possible i didnt book beforehand ended up waiting 20 minutes the first night a saturday and 5 minutes today monday for a table

yummy, this restraunt was bustling with people enjoying which is a great advert in itself considering the road works out side service and food great and value for money, hit it on way to peace hotel afternoon tour and found the prices right especially in bund area disappointed i could not find the caramelized pork belly written up in trip advisor 3 days tour guide staff seemed clueless when i asked, got there 12 hour before closing not rushed ordered 2 entrees and had plenty of time to enjoy before closing
thanks for a delicious meal, we chose this restaurant based on tripadvisor reviews and they were spot on the two of us shared the house special red braised pork spicy green beans and crab with rice this is a very busy restaurant and you may have to wait fortunately we were able to walk in and get a tableit was packed with locals and tourists alike and both the food and the experience made for a memorable evening, they pack you in and force you to share tables but the food is good and easy to order as staff speak a little english and there are pictures and english translations we enjoyed the eggplant, great food and there seemed to be lots of locals there by some means a good measure of a quality establishment additionally as a nonlocal and thus challenged in my abilities to speak mandarin the pictures in the menu are greatly appreciated

no quite street meat prices but certainly better quality

i went here on a layover in pvg and will go back the next time i pass through, try grandmother next time good food fast service  even if you have to wait some minutes to get a table and reasonable prices be were that you have to wait if you are more than 2 or if you come after 7, grandmother restaurant close to the peace hotel is a great place to eat authentic and good chinese food that is reasonably priced the atmosphere is good and the food really is excellent it is part of a chain of grandmother restaurants and i would thoroughly recommend it, stumbled upon the restaurant whilst trying to get some shelter from the rain located at fuzhou road nearby to the bund the restaurant has a variety of food from shanghainese to delicacies from other parts of china

it seems to be a favourite haunt amongst tourists and the funny thing is the waiting staff dont speak english luckily menu is filled with wonderful pictures

the speciality appears to be the fatty pork but we didnt order

price wise  very reasonable, outstanding caramelized pork hairy crab with rice cakes spicy fish with vermicelli edamame are to try as they are cooked or arranged in wine dice line the drunken chicken the hairy crab roe tofu lacks taste but the hairy crab itself though a little small was outstandingly delicious one needs to bring the hk hairy crab gears =cisors + a spoon to enjoy even more the hairy crabs, is a shanghai food food overall okay the worker cant smile order 5 dish and drink only $248 not expensive, this place seems to be very popular as its close to the bund the service was quick and friendly the menu has pictures and english title which made it easier unfortunately i was solo so could only try two of their dishes the traditional soy sauce pork and apparatus prawn both was really nice but i would have liked to sample more will come back with more people to sample the greater selection the bill was also very light on the wallet which is a added bonus in the expensive shanghai, authentic chinese food served in a two floor diner environment menu with photos very well prepared food at affordable price highly recommended for a quick and tasty meal, the braised pork and mapo tofu are terrific in flavor and execution youll notice that nearly every table has these two staples prices are fair and theres even a cctv feed of the kitchen prep room where you can watch the chefs grab the ingredients for each dish expansive menu would likely go back for seconds, they have so much food and its cheap and very good the menu has photos so you know what you are ordering and they have an english menu we would go back here right now if we could very good, not spectacular but as advertised quick cheap enough and food is tasty went with family and played it safe and the kids were more than happy with what came out, my partner and i visited from trip advisor and lonely planet food was fab we waited 10 mins for a table easy to communicate via menu we had two main dishes and rice with a couple of drinks the noodles were delicious as was the chicken dish it was busy but not overbearing my parter and i really enjoyed the food and would definitely return if in shanghai i highly recommend a visit, we were there during the chinese holidays and needed to wait about 10 minutes to get the table the menu had many pictures so we could easily make a choice by the pictures just too many choices for tasty food, we were in shanghai for a week and ended up eating here 3 times as we enjoyed it so much the diners were mostly locals but the place was also accommodating to tourists  with friendly staff pictures of dishes and meaningful translations efficient service also good sized portions so we only needed 2 dishes plus rice for 2 people that plus a beer and a soft drink was around 100110 yuan approx <u+00a3>12 very popular restaurant that got very busy we arrived before 6 and got a table no problem but by the time we left people were queueing out the door note they dont take visa for payment, was practical to head to this place from our hotel just around the corner the menu is pretty varied and extensive but we stuck to mainstream offers we had braised pork braised chicken garlic spinach and caramelized eggplant it was very tasty
table was slightly sticky though not sure how clean the cloth used was but the rest looked relatively clean, this is a simple good chinese restaurant endless menu options we ordered 4 plates including 3 cup chicken tofu asparagus snow peas and chicken  egg soup 2 large beers and 2 natural juices check was $41 usd very fair price in shanghai and good quantity of food, the recommended dish  braised pork in brown sauce cant remember the exact name was really good it can get pretty crowded during lunch time so perhaps you might want to go earlier for brunch instead

the only down thing was that theres only one serving size which is quite big so cant order too many items, had read a number of earlier reviews and decided to give it a try not disappointed extensive menu with some interesting choices portions are big so dont order too many as we did great place to eat with english shown on the menu would thoroughly recommend, based on trip advisor reviews i had planned on visiting grandmothers before our trip but was even more impressed after our meal service was excellent and the food even better we sat next to another american visiting shanghai and after seeing the huge menu with all the pictures he remarked this is just like dennnys you can get anything here food is a lot better than dennys though, this is a really popular restaurant for both tourists and locals its very reasonably priced particularly given its location near the bund where everything costs a fortune we ate here twice because we liked it so much and both times it came in at about 250 rmb and we ordered about 6 dishes and beers the braised tofu was very moreish as was the prawns with vermicelli noodles all in all id really recommend this restaurant despite the photo , good shanghai food decent prices and a menu with english and pictures for those who dont speak chinese also an easy walk from the bund

try the xiaolongbao and the tea shrimp tons of good noodle dishes too, we arrived at 9pm and where told that the kitchen closed at 930
we quickly ordered and the food came very fast and it was fantastic worth the visit while in shanghai, fodo and service is amazing  read reviews and know what to order  dont expect to have a fork  food is amazing good  menu is both in english and chinese which was great if we ever return it will be first on our list  our waitor could not speak english but customer that spoke english helped us","bar",0.93261598732686
32,"very nice service rex was awesome and so was alex such a special evening and be sure to follow with a glass of champagne at flair amazing views and food, the perfect taste experience and really local hongkongnes taste i have to say here jin xuan surprises me lol and sunshine she is good service i feel so happy and enjoy it, this is my first time to try an asian cuisine michelin starred restaurant located inside ritz carlton hotel has amazing view table set ups are like from heaven service is perfect from a very well trained staff the food from colds to warm were sublime perfect expensive but worth and must try chinese fine dining, visited for year end business diner the dining room was lovely the food delicious the service top class also the management responded favourably to an extraordinary request making the entire evening more memorable this is what makes the difference well done and maintain this high level of guestminded service, ate here after two weeks in rural china with very basic food and drink this made the jin xuan a very special experience we ordered a selection of starters and main courses and everything was fantastic in terms of quality taste and presentation the highlights were the roast peking duck and the australian beef the duck was so tender juicy and tasty with a crisp skin but no layer of white fat the cubes of australian beef were so tasty and so tender that you had to wonder how this was achieved

the decor is very pleasant and the panoramic view from the 53rd floor location gives great views across the tv tower and river the maitre d was very engaging and polite and advised us how to avoid shellfish due to an allergy he even raced to our rescue when he saw one of the waitresses serve us a selection of sauces including a shirt and scallop paste the lady playing the chinese harp made a atmospheric background

the recently awarded michelin  is very well deserved this restaurant is worth searching out, i try the best of the best when it comes to food so i had to try jin xuan in shanghai despite the pricey meal i was impressed by the service by alex qiang a local who knows as much about wines as much as how to serve overseas chinese clients 1 michelin star but a 5 service stars experience strongly recommended, we went to this restaurant right after checking in the ritzcarlton for a night before our cruise and were not planning on a fine dining experience thats because this is the lowest rated restaurant according to tripadvisors reviews of the 3 restaurants in the ritzcarlton pudong this is the only chinese restaurant in the hotel and we just wanted to have some chinese food before going to bed to our surprises the waiter told us after we have seated that they have just received their michelin star after looking over the menu we finally decided to give it a try and we both ordered one of the chef menus the service was slow but the food was excellent the dishes were not greasy and were very tasty the chef came out and chatted with us after the dinner nice job, fantastic food and viewbe prepared to spend 1000 dollar for two  signature menu and a bottle of wine some dishes are spectacularopen all daysask for window table or arrive arond 6pm to get best tablesif you add 300 dollars you can have a more spectacular dinner at ultraviolet but they are closed sunday and monday, very good serviceand food is nice excellent view of huangpu river waitress is patient and helpful, had a great dinner here food is very reasonably priced tasty service is just perfect the best is teh view get a table next to window and you will have an amazing dinner, i visited jin xun today for lunch after hearing so much about it alas what a disappointing dining experience

the most disappointing is the service i think the staff need more training they are wooden and mechanical like the average chinese restaurant staff no explanation about what they serve or put on table eg when a staff poured hot water for the tea she made no eye contact did not utter a word when a staff was taking my tea order another staff asked me what kind of water i would like to have a male staff was coughing but continued to serve us

the food is at best average the roasted pork was bland chinese dim sum didnt taste freshly made though i knew they were

the decor is really loud and uninspiring the owner could have done a better job by differentiating it from the ubiquitous chinese restaurants they wasted the awesome view around the restaurant, jin xuan is a restaurant located in the 53rd floor of the ritz carlton hotel which guarantees a magnificent view of shanghais skyline just in front of the pearl tower the place has a romantic ambiance which will be perfect for an awesome dinner roasted duck was something outstanding especially accompanied by a fine and varied cellar the restaurant is expensive but it is worth every yuan a most in shanghai, we had a table by the window so that we could watch the sunset over the skyline which was just amazing

my uncle is lucky enough to know chef daniel who is an very talented chef he cooked us an incredible menu including pork belly with caviar scallop noodle soup a delicious piece of cod wagu beef fried rice mango pudding with ice cream and fruit salad to finish

we would return in a heartbeat, i booked this evening almost two weeks ahead of the trip and was excited to experience fine dining and chinese cuisine it was very disappointing at such a grand and expensive restaurant they are still using fake taste msg i feel totally conned, service very friendly they offered the kids drink when we were waiting and seated us immediately once the table is available
view we sat at a round table next to the window and had a great view of the bund  although it was cloudy that say 
food the portion is huge and its nicely done we came for lunch and ordered 4 noodle dish  more than we needed for us 4 adults and 2 kids the food is a bit greasy which is the only negative part

they are very nice with kids but its quite formal so i wouldnt go again with young kids, the view food and service are amazing the prices are a bit pricy but it is truly a michelin style experiences compare to hong kong ritz chinese restaurant i think they are both amazing truffle roasted duck and the steam cod with xo sauce are amazing try to book early to secure a beautiful bund view sit next time will try lunch to check out their dim sum, my mother and i spent a night at ritzcarlton pudong when visiting the restaurants in the hotel we were attracted by the stunning bund view and decided to come for dinner at dinner time we were led to a fantastic table private environment and sweeping view of bund

we were very happy with their warmhearted service elaine was taking care of our orders she was very sweet and even showed us their glamorous private dining room so that we could take good pictures of pearl tower the beverage manager henry came over chatting with us all the gestures by the service team were natural and warm

the dishes offer generous quantity and very tasty however they were a little bit too oily but i think that its up to individuals taste

overall we had a very good impression of this restaurant and will come back in the future, treated ourselves to a lovely meal here on our last night in shanghai booked in the morning and secured a large table with a view over the bund service staff were excellent and good natured with our three children so glad that we ordered the most interesting entree of peking duck and foie gras beautiful setting and live music pricey but highly recommended, the view is amazing and the dining environment is comfortable since the table distance is right food food is delicious especially the soup duck and cod fish sommelier has offered a surprised wine pairing which make our dinner ended unforgettable
a must go in shanghai, had a lovely meal here during my recent business trip to shanghai
mrs see from the restaurant was very accommodating and good with us she recommended the dishes for us to try and i must say i liked almost all of them

my favourites were the roast duck with truffle and the beef cubes pan fried the soup was also amazing and i must say that it was a very very nice meal, 20th february 2016 i had booked a beautiful table in advance overlooking the bund one of the many tables that offered a superb view i used this restaurant to propose to my girlfriend and the members of staff were wonderful throughout the atmosphere in the restaurant was peaceful an artist playing beautiful music on traditional chinese instruments at a perfect volume the food was the best my partner and i have tasted in shanghai we chose steamed cod with xo sauce and the wagyu beef as well as a few other accompanying dishes the menu offers a decent range of fish beef chicken vegetable dishes and the wine list is vast with knowledgeable staff at your beck and call to offer further information if required a very special thank you to ryan and the rest of the team at ritzcarlton  jin xuan restaurant for providing us with a perfect evening, i had my birthday in shanghai with my friends last month the food was so nice the service was excellent the price was valuable i should say everything was simple and normal that night until a gift tray with cute lion toys and tasty desserts to be presented in front of me it was unbelievable the restaurant staff prepared such a wonderful surprise for me even i am now back to my home town i still want to say thank you to everyone who made that night shining, this restaurant is located on the 53rd floor i enjoyed very good view of the bund whole night every dishs decoration was gorgeous and taste was very nice the restaurant deserves a michelin star although the price was a little bit high but my friend and i enjoyed the experience of the dinner that night the waiters were kind and provided attentive service their smiles were sweet and the manager was handsome i remember one lady whose name is elva she is very nice thank you guys and we are looking forward to going back next time, lets get the important piece out of the way first quality of food was good albeit i would not say that the preparation of several dishes was the best i have had by any means given i ordered many of the chefs recommendations one may want not to stray to other parts of the menu now for the service  as a solo diner  being tucked away in a corner always is a concern especially if the attentiveness of staff to your wine glass is poor  which it was i dont like pouting my own wine but i had to do it on three occasions during dinner perhaps some training required, i must say this was one of the best chinese dining experiences i ever had the food is amazing creative yet authentic the view is stunning from up there service impeccable we had a tasting menu and what the chef put on the plate was just amazing this restaurant deserves a michelin star or two definitely cant go wrong, i go to many different restaurants at hotels and am always looking out for the quality of both the food and the service that being said i am impressed by both the food and excellent service that was provided to me and i would like to commend and congratulate the team at jin xuan chinese restaurant for their kind attentiveness and sincerity during my dining experience thank you guys and i look forward to my next visit, the view is great you are 53 floors up and you get a good view of the bund and the river

the food was very bland even the spicy food was pretty tasteless it is in a ritz so of course it is expensive as well but there is no real value for money spent unless you are so jet lagged that you do not want to leave the hotel i suggest finding some other place close by and going there

service was so so as well took a while after we were ready to order before the waitress came to take the order the food came really quickly which makes me wonder how much is prepared in advance and reheated vs being fresh the beef in the noodle dish didnt taste very fresh

if the food had been a little worse or the view not so good then i probably would have given 2 stars

go to flair bar enjoy the view and then go eat somewhere else, our first event meal out in shanghai and a fantastic start before we mention the food the welcome was delightful they remembered our telephone booking and made a rather pleasant fuss of us the table was set allowing us to look over the bund with pearl tower visible via a reflection it was like watching a slow motion firework display for our whole time at the restaurant the staff were superb not overbearing but attentive and friendly so a great ambiance and the food wasnt too shabby either we went for a set menu pricey but look where you are every course was superbly presented with at least one interesting twist on the plate a weird hot melon with parma ham sitting in gravy didnt work for us but otherwise very good cantonese chinese food with the best chinese desserts ive had overall pricey but for a very occasional treat worth it for an excellent all round experience, the view from jin xuan in 53rd floor of the ritz in pudong is incredible but you can get same view from the 52nd floor bar or the 58th floor flair lounge the decor is nice too but the food is poor or average and the service is not all that great very pricey and all our food was over seasonedheavy on salt have been to much much better formal chinese restaurants service was weak and the timing of the dishes was inconsistent and off  go appetizer and main dish together and then 15 minutes later got the vegetables do not recommended coming here","Italian cuisine",0.831416322885331
33,"their rossini is a mustdrink cocktail their service is impeccable their view is like any this else well maybe a few others in the bund have it still  food is moderately good to be very honest not impeccable as the rest a pasta was not al dente and oversalted burrata salad though was great it is hard to spoil it its great place to visit for preparty drinks on the bund but maybe have a dinner first at godfellas next door make sure you book a table there otherwise impossible to get in, first time in shanghai with a nonchinese food eater food service and view was excellent well definitely be back prior to leaving shanghai very casual atmosphere with great ownership, highly recommended by our hotel food was excellent wines also were great service was out of this world good they made you feel so special wish i had time to eat there again dont miss this place, living in shanghai i discovered many places but the fellas is certainly one of the best places i have been first the view is incredible secondly the food made me remember my last trip in italia excellent pizzas to share pastas and wine the staff also recommended me great cocktails my girlfriend chose the mushroom risotto which was also excellent
then i highly recommend the fellas to enjoy a good night, we visited this italian restaurant a couple of times  pizzas were very good and the view is great complimentary mandarinello each visit much appreciated, to be honest i wanted to have dinner at the goodfellas but it was a 2 hour wait so we were recommended to go here great advice this place has the best food a wonderful view and super cool staff

starting by this terrace being at the 7 floor you get to see shanghais financial district and tower which by night are truly amazing

then the staff will treat you great recommend food and drinks ask you if theres anything to be helped with the only weird thing could be having to give a deposit for a powerbank mobile charger but at the end it doesnt ruin the whole experience

and finally but most important food and drink variety in wine and cocktail lists moderate prices food menu is wide and everything we tried was delicious id suggest the beef carpaccio a mushroom risotto and pizza diavola everything to share

nice, came here thinking food would be the same standard as good fellas but were very disappointed  not what i was expecting small  cold portions of taste less pasta and starters but pizza was ok view is good and drinks were ok if a little slow, excellent food and service i work close to the restaurant and have passed by hundreds of times before i finally went in i was amazed at what a cool little spot this is a lot of good choices on the menu stunning view on the bund and have a terrace great place loved it, first time at fellas food is super good and the service very professional
shouldve taken a doggy bag , i had a great time going to the fellas for dinner the place is beautiful it has a great view and the food is absolutely delicious i went there with some friends we shared courses and had some drinks i strongly recommend this place you wont be disappointed, this month i went for the second time to the fellas the first time i came to the place was last summer to have some drinks with a friend visiting i went to take him to a nice bur to enjoy the view i just went back to the fellas few days ago to enjoy a nice dinner with my friends i was thinking for a while to check the restaurant however i became vegetarian recently so i was a bit afraid of the option i was quite wrong as a vegetarian i was able to enjoy lot of food and everything was tasty i highly recommend the eggplant lasagna it was really good we also try a veggies pizza which was really tasty some of my friends ordered a risotto and the sea bass which seemed good as well we are all happy with the quality of the food and the drinks the service was also really good which is so hard to find in shanghai i highly recommend this place to people who are visiting shanghai and look for a nice place to eat and enjoy the vue, been there with my friends and it was great i am vegetarian and they have plenty of choices the atmosphere is nice and the view is amazing nice place and yummy food their signature cocktails are pretty cool too i also loved their staff, i visited 2 times fellas
one time just for a drink i tried the moscow mule which was good
i went yesterday night with my stepsister we got a drink outside in the terrasse it was not cold and enjoyed the amazing view of the bund i ordered one glass of red wine which was pretty good and a mixed platter to share  meatballs salmon canapes tortillas and tomato with tuna
then we went outside and ordered 2 pizzas one rocket and prosciutto and diavola with spicy salami both were really good
we were so full  we did not take any dessert
we left and walked on the bund

first of all ive never seen such a nice view in shanghai hopefully the pearl tower was switched on this view of lujiazui district was amazing
the food was at the same level of the location and the view astonishing
we order oysters as a starter and raviolis pizza and risotto to share as the main dish i highly recommend the beef and truffle raviolis which has been my favorite meal the dishes portions are totally fine the taste is delicious and the service was very good


can�t wait to go back during the summer to enjoy a delicious cocktail on the terrace , really nice place located on the bund the food is really good and affordable compared to the other restaurant in the area
the setup is nice and cosy
i loved the burrata and the ravioli, didnt expect it was dat cozy thought we cant stay in their lobby because of the freezing weather but they set up a tent wd heater which was amazing as u can see d great view of the bund their food was also simply amazing like we order a lot and the service was great definitely will go back here, i have been to the fellas to try something new on the bund i was first amazed by the giant terrace they have the view is awesome and for sure i will come back as soon as the sunny days are back as soon as we seat the staff came to us and offered help to choose dishes as i m big fan of italian she suggested me to try their homemade beef ravioli the portion was ok but the taste just great the mushroom sauce on top was fantastic as well i took moscow mule afterward as the place seems to be also go for a drink and the drink was perfect to recommend to people who loved chilled place  italian food, been in this place 2 times and it was a great food experience
the food was amazingly delicious even my chinese friend who dont usually eat nonchinese cuisine loved the food
then the service their staff was superb all smiles and they ensure that you have the best dining experience
and lastly the view been to different restaurants around the bund area but the view from the fellas was better we actually spend new years eve there
dont have much picture of their foods we are too eager to finish it when they served it haha, i ve been there many times with friends and we really enjoyed the place the foods wines services and the skyline view made us feels so good, great winter terrace


friends from shanghai brought us to the fellas because we pizza lovers 

first thing we seen entering to the place is the giant terrace that the place have the view is just great and the fact that we put a kind of tant helped us to enjoy dining on the terrace as it was as hot as inside

we started with a famous italian cheese called burrata it was big enough for 2 people and accompanied with delicious olives and salad then we ordered 2 differents types of pizza daviola spicy beef and norcina vegetarian + 1 sea bass that we share

the seabass didnt last long as the pizza as the quality of dishes was just succulent  will be difficult to order something else whe we ll come back

finishing with the staff they have been super cool with us suggesting different option for dinner telling us about their offer and during the all evening asking us if we were cold on terrace and if we needed blanket

a place to recommend totally, first of all you have a warm welcome when you come in the service is paying attention to you ready to take your order but can suggest you whats the chef recommendation too personnaly i took the burrata many times its my favourite place for it the beef is also very tasty i would def come back again and again maybe more in summer time to enjoy the beautiful view on the bund, in shanghai for few days we stopped by the fellas because friends of us recommended it

it was astonishing  we started with the eggplant parmigiana that looks like a lasagna succulent  then the manager mark advised us to go with the australian beef to share we loved it well accompanied with roasted vegetables and pepper sauce they have also a long list of wines
the overall was top and the view over the bund is speechless

totally addict, i dined at fellas after nye and even though it is usually a lazy week in shanghai the terrace was full the service was extremely attentive the view is stunning and we were able
to dine outside in the terrace thanks to well working heaters last but not least the quality of food worths a positive note they serve freshly baked bread with italian olive oil the pizza was tasty and i am italian and tuna and salmon tartare absolutely mouthwatering, i am italian going for business in shanghai since many years  i am a regular at goodfellas and now i enjoy their new the fellas terrace italian recipes one of best view in town and a very personal and warm hospitality in the perfect style of the host owner marco
dont miss it, located in the heart of all the bunds action the fellas will not disappoint food was great the view is stunning from one of the best terraces in the area and the atmosphere is fun good place to visit during a trip to shanghai or to plan an event, fantastic environment and amazing foodfeels great to go and always receive a very warn welc9me from mr marco owner definitely a must to try in shanngai  will be back soon  ps what a spectacular view , i have visited shanghai for the first time and a friend of mine had suggested me to visit the fellas once i got into the place the first expression was  woww   the view to the bund area is breathtaking  after had some shot with my camera i have met the gm marco who has suggested me something to share with my other friends and lobster sea food as main course the wine list is properly wide and well fitted great experience in shanghai must visit i will come back, stunning view best ever in shanghai amazing food especially pasta n pizza cocktail are cool and the wine selection fulfil any request i ve been with my gfriend romantic atmosphere for a date and we have enjoyed lobster spaghetti and wagyu beef i shall be coming back soon, well firstly it is undoubtedly the best terrace on the bund you are engulfed in the surroundings of both sides of the river old and new and you are down and in the middle it ive been to them all many times but no doubt this is the best one you can go any time any day the team is just awesome no nonsense just great food and drinks cool atmosphere cool people fun times

definitely on my regular list

i cant wait for the summer time brunches  now that is going to be epic, the fellas ticks so many boxes for all sorts of occasions i have been there twice now  once with a friend for a late night bite and the other for a client dinner on both visits i was extremely satisfied and left smiling

lets start with my first encounter  a friend and i were tired cold and quite simply dying for a strong drink and some tasty western food it was after midnight so i wasnt expecting much but boy did those margaritas and pizza go down well it was seriously perfect and i never imagined such a place existed we first tried goodfellas downstairs but the kitchen had closed so they recommended the terrace upstairs when we arrived on the 7th floor we were seen to immediately and were able to put in a last order before the kitchen closed the staff were so accommodating and friendly  we felt super welcome the pizza hit the spot ie we inhaled it and the atmosphere was super cosy music was good and not too loud to the point where you cant talk of course my favourite thing about the fellas has to be the terrace and the view but that doesnt mean the service or food suffers its all good

on my second visit we took clients from the uk who were visiting shanghai and again the fellas delivered we made a last minute booking so we were sitting at the end of the high table alongside another group of 4 i thought it might feel cramped at first but it didnt at all service was again great  we asked the manager to put together a sharing menu for us and they were able to serve plenty of plates and pour plenty of wine with the utmost ease nothing worse than going to a restaurant where the plates are too big for the table and the waiters havent a clue we seriously impressed the clients and we took loads of photos outside the view at night is incredible it was a fantastic evening

i will always go back to the fellas when im in town highly recommend this to anyone looking for a snack a drink a lavish meal or a fun time its just awesome, one of my favourite restaurants in shanghai having been to this place half a dozen times ive lived in shanghai for close to 2 years and from what ive seen this is one of the best places for italian food lovers the drinks are also top class in particular the red wines i have no complaints the staff are always so friendly and i will continue to go back to this place particularly if you are a tourist i feel that the view from this rooftop restaurant is very beautiful and makes you appreciate this city a lot it is located in the best area of shanghai so a great way to being your night at i highly recommend you give this place a try, the fellas is the perfect place to enjoy a wonderful evening with your friends
amazing view from the bund and such a dedicated service makes this place very special
i chose the fellas to celebrate my birthday and it was my best birthday ever
overall this place is outstanding and i recommend to everyone who would like to have a special night out in the beautiful city of shanghai, atmosphere chilling peaceful
location the center great view perfect for taking pictures
service so friendly and caring meal without delay
food delicious savory
drinks amazing winerich bar
interior simple shabby sofas
in general the fellas is one of shanghais  should visit places, last thursday night spent a great time with girls really liked the terrace there food and drinks are quite good didnt like the interior its simple enough for this kind of places recommend to upgrade it a bit but for the rest the fellas is a good place for chilling having meals and drinks, the views from this place are very nice surrounded by the bund and in front of pudong but as much as the views are good so are the cocktails they have a wide cariety and they prepare them really well i am very fond of the negroni and it was one of the best i have ever had a great moment to go is around 6 when all the buildings start lighting up, really bad all around made a dinner reservation for 4 and when we got there they put us in the bar area when we asked for a proper table they replace the bar table with a fold up table in the very same bar area needless to say we go up and left straight away just really incompetent staff and service, being unable to get into goodfellas italian they recommended fellas to us first impression was great as it is situated on the 7th floor of a building with good views over the river

when the menu arrived i was a little disappointed at just how limited it was for an italian very few pizzas and pasta dishes to choose from and not a great deal else

i ordered a beer which was warm and my colleague a mojito which she said tasted nonalcoholic

the food tasted ok but i wouldnt rush back there","Japanese cuisine",0.999464689867893
331,"well run executive lounge with a wide variety of selections there is a full western breakfast offered as well as a chinese breakfast tea and a happy hour it is a pleasant space, the executive lounge is actually located on the 38 floor of the hotel

incredible first class service really really good buffet breakfast so much to choose from and everything delicious mostly american items but they will also have a few chinese items to choose from

we are hilton gold so breakfast was free breakfast is served from 6  10 am

we also tried the evening cocktail reception and that was also very nice they make you feel like a vip every time, its huge and it has great views of the city nice selection of soft drinks and some alcohol nice staff good to have a coffee, i eat in a lot of hilton hotels and this is as good as any great choices of fruit pastries and hot cooked to order breakfast, if anyone of you are staying in hilton shanghai please ensure you have the opportunity to visit the lounge the service staff are excellent and the food quality changes on daily basis no room to complaints but only compliments keep up the good work guys i am indeed one of the super happy guest in hilton shanghai, i was pleasantly surprised to see that the executive lounge at the hilton had stepped it up again being a long time visitor for the past 10 years or so i have seen it gone from greatness to bad back to good i hope with what i saw today  the goal is greatness again work on the food a bit more and youll get there

i love the staff at the lounge they are helpful nice and really service minded, i was a guest of a friend i do not know how much is but the restaurant was excellent you can look at the skyline of the town the restaurant has a rotating floor, service was very nice and while selection isnt huge for breakfast quality was very good get a table by the window and admire the view of shanghai, the staff are efficient and helful and went out of their way to resolve problems including snafu with wifi the ambiance is everything one expects from a hilton executive lounge
also the view of the temple across the street at night is absolutely fabulous, check in and be pampered all formalities for a club room are handled here you can bypass the front desk and go straight to the lounge great staff and service, good for breakfast afternoon tea and evening drinks large windows display 270 degrees i would estimate of shanghai including pudong towers on clear days less polite than japan where i live but so are most places on earth a good perk for gold or diamond level members, the lounge at this hotel is extremely large with a lot of quiet areas as it is not just one big open room also the breakfast is better than a lot as there is an eggomelet station and often they are just mushy scrambled eggs lastly the happy hour and food is also very good it is worth the extra cost and if you get it for free with your status even better, the service was fabulous and the food was delicious and varied there was good floor service with servers appointed to all the tables, although the room was beautifully appointed the staff made it a delightful home away from home they were always welcoming and eager to assist, clean and kept clean during busy times service is good with many servers to attend you fast check in and check outno problems, one of the most consistent and highvalue lounges in asia outstanding service excellent and varied foods quality wines and spirits free wifi access comfortable surroundings and one of the best views in all of shanghai, appetizer selection is higher end including shrimp and other fine selections managers reception for executive guests is until 830pm, great lounge to relax or work quiet with superb coffee and view the food and drink were also welcome, plenty of choice of food every time some were local dishes some were western dishes but all was very good gave a good chance to try local dishes from somewhere you could trust the dumplings which are a local specialty were lovely, a pity from a place that used to be so good now seems like everyone can get in food quality really needs improvement and patrons are allowed to speak on their phones screaming and very noise and no one form the staff does anything has become a regular bar in a 2 stars hotel or a pub at a hostel, snacks are good drinks are nice more attention should be paid to the guests if you are the guest please dont expect too much from them, the food is good not excessive but is good enough the only thing it gets crowded on weekend mornings, second night and i have had to pay for my partners drinks staff trying hard but attention to basics is ordinary to stay the least warm white wine then deciding to give me a drink that they thought i might like poor communicant skills sours the experiencenot up to the standard i would expect and this is the second night of an eight night stayi cant recommend it and not likely to stay here for a third timeprevious short stay was better, only a big minus to the managment they should not charge for one guest you invited to the lounge and like mentioned before if you use internet in the room in executive floor it is only foolish to charge 160 rmb a day for that, i have spent few days at hilton and was using executive lounge both for business meetings teleconferences as well as evening relax for all those activities the lounge is a grest place and the staff is very helpful and well trained, great views attentive and helpful staff decent foodalthough does get busy first thing in the morning, the breakfasts are buffet and made to order there is tea time with sweets always water soda etc available and at night there is a bounty of food and alcoholic drinks to imbibe peter is a delight to engage in conversation tim is another of the friendly staff he is a basketball player and you cant miss him",NA,NA
332,"new name is sichuan folk the restaurant was very nice the food was excellent and the dinner show was excellent while sichuan style it was not to spicy we watched the sichuan opera the show of masks changing was amazing i will definitely go back on my next shanghai trip, all dishes are not so spicy we can enjoy sichuan style vegetable chicken pork bean guard every food is ok the staff is very kind
it is only bad point that our booking was canceled when we arrived 3 minutes delayed usually it is waited for 15 minutes, taken here by a chinese host who did all the ordering id eaten sichuan a few times before but a couple of interesting new dishes popped up such as the snake fish everything was very good if not something i would usually order

remember not to bite into the sichuan pepper corns, this is the second restaurant i have visited from this chain in shanghai and the first one was in expo area in this case it sits on the 3rd floor of a building with very spacious rooms for groups and even a larger one were you can dine and watch the show of masks changing
the food was delicious and service quite good our chinese friends did all the selection for us since there is not much english speaking staffbe ready for the spicy dishes since this a trait of the sichuan food during dinner we moved to another large room to watch the show of face changing for about 10 min, went there with a couple of fellow travellers i have to say it was a good cultural experience the menu was pretty interesting food was exceptional however was bit too spicy for me make sure u ask for a little or no chilli for most of the dishes seemed red but i like the whole company must visit again, was taken here by chinese hosts on recent visit to shanghai they did all the ordering but we enjoyed everything it was hot food but not mouth numbing the highlight was the face changing performance lots of commotion at door then a person heavily dressed in chinese traditional clothes came in mobbed by cameras he then performed an amazing dance where his face mask kept changing with no apparent help from him it was over way too quick if you can see it do we were the only europeans there that night so it was a truly local chinese experience, great sichuan food  also the mask show is very fascinating  nevertheless the overall atmosphere is a little bit disappointing as you cannot really feel that you are supposed to be in a sichuanese environment, another regular stop in my where to entertain visiting friends route the changing faces performance is always a winner and the delicious and authentic fiery sichuan food never fail to impress, this restaurant in pudong has changed its name to sichuan folk we went there to see the famous face changing show it is performed at around 700 pm every night the restaurant takes reservations so you can be sure to get a table for the show it is the most amazing dance with the dancer miraculously changing his facial color and expression from red to black to green to white with a wave of his hand the restaurant is very attractive and the food is awesome even our kids loved it you can ask your waiter for recommendations for dishes that arent too spicy hot if youre not into hot sichuan food the prices were unbelievably reasonable the restaurant is across the street from the metro stop you have to go in a building to find the restaurant on the second floor we liked it so much we planned to go again during our 5night stay in shanghai but ran out of time, ba guo bu yi appears to have about a dozen restaurants throughout china most notably in beijing and is the place a local chinese colleague might take a visitor to shanghai the feature act is the apparently famous facechanger who performs an intriguing act for about 10 minutes starting at 8pm the food is spicy some of it very spicy sichuan fare and that which i dared to eat such as the yummy mapo tofu was pretty goodi never saw the bill but apparently quite reasonably priced recommended",NA,NA
333,"the place is hard to find but it worst it nice atmosphere inside with large square many russian tradition food on menu tasty but a bit expensive, it was really nice place to visitfood was good we just missed only nice service from the waiter therei hope we wil come back again, i am russian i had a meeting with my business american business partners here
everything was just fine the food is good the atmosphere is very authentic waiters are nice and friendly but my american partner was very upset because one administrator or waiter was not nice to him he was trying to ask her a suggestions about the russian dishes and some russian traditional food she replied him i dont have time and then start ignoring him i was trying to ask her the reason of such unacceptable behavior but she said that shes really busy and she have to prepare lots of things and she dont have free time for talks i said that i will complain about it to the manager after that she told in a very loud tone okay good luck to you it was too much i think then i found a waitress and asked a name of this woman she said me her name is natalya then we just left i really believe that red square is open to constructive discussion and can find approach how to motivate such people because i think she was really very angry or upset, i was in shanghai for a few days and my ukrainian girlfriend suggested we come here it wasnt too hard to get to as the metro lines and bus stations are really close but actually finding the restaurant in the complex can be a little tricky luckily they do have signs that tell you where to go so it isnt too difficult

the atmosphere is really calm and its a good place to go for a relaxing dinner the service was good and whenever we needed anything there was someone on the floor also they have a students menu with discounted food which is nice we ordered wine shuba olivie pelmeni uha mashed potatoes and for dessert some napoleon cake which came to a little under 300 rmb after some of the discounts
the wine selection was small but the port was really good the shuba was good and one of the larger portioned items we orderd the olivie was a bit smaller but just as good the uha was a bit spicier than normal but was still really tasty the mashed potatoes were just as any other nothing to complain about the pelmeni was the best of the bunch plenty of sauce and mushrooms made it really filling
lastly the napoleon was a bit different from normal not very flaky or creamy but still tasted fine

however the service is what really deserves high praise natalia the floor manager was attentive kind and answered any questions we had she seemed to always be speaking to the other diners or busy keeping everything clean she also recommended the red port which was extremely good

overall i had heard great things of this place and it lived up to my expectations when i visited i would definitely come back whenever i could, the food was the best russian food since the last time i was in russia the student price deal was a great one my friend and i took advantage of the borscht was great and the food seemed pretty authentic a bit more out of the way and probably best suited to be taxied to it was worth the trip, i read some of the negative reviews of this place but decided to just adjust my expectations and give it a try the food was below my expectations and my expectations were not high the food is really subpar and expensive the dressed herring or herring under a fur coat tasted a bit off the borscht just tasted like vegetable soup the mushroom and cheese covered pelmeni was average the beef stroganoff was really weird the meat was dry and stringy the sauce was not creamy and had no onions or mushrooms instead the sauce was like a bolognese furthermore it was served cold we asked for it to be heated up a server never came back with it we asked another server to go get it and the dish came back only slightly warmer i will not be going back or recommending to anyone, great place to smoke shisha and hang out with friends russian food is amazing with good prices and quality food  i had an amazing time i do recommend it, small portions service is very slow location is bad food is good but for this price portions could be bigger but the best russian restaurant in shanghai as there is only two of them, small but good menu of course the food is not like back home but anyways really nice especially my mexican friend was out of his mind for me was quite regular the service is nice but im just wondering do they speak english or not location is strange and one more point the inside interior looks more moroccan than russian generally good food good price good place but for once in a while, being russian here in china i find quite difficult to find a real russian cuisine but this place exceeded all my expectations it was really great experience even my american boyfriend loved vodka and borscht here they also have a store where you can buy russian food im so glad and proud to find this restaurant, not bad strange location food is ok and definitely overpriced the feeling of ussr or communist era the best part is mini ipad menu, i have been there a few times before but last time was literally the last the attitude was sensed from the very beginning when we entered the premises  a caucasian girl at the bar who was wiping glasses rolled her eyes so deep that it felt that they were gonna jump out of the orbits  the menu came in a form of an ipad all in chinese  i had to call a waiter to remind that im not chinese and i would appreciate if i could read it in an accessible language  when we made our choices  it was impossible to call the waiter through the ipad because of �send error� message  so we had to wave fuyuan as usual we ordered a good amount of food  two salads  two soups  two mains and a serving of chicken wings plus a jug of beer  my partner wanted to have some drinking water but one of the waitresses said �we dont offer any drinking water�  full stop here i asked a question  how is it possible to have such a service attitude  considering the fact that now they are charging 15 of service fee like in five star hotels  she replied �i dont know im not a director here�  later she came to the table to announce that there were no chicken wings  there was no �sorry� either the question here is  what is the sense of the interactive menu then  if it shows the nonexistent dishes
we started to get our order little by little  one of salads came first  no bread or drinks came before  we had to complain multiple times about that  when finally cold bread arrived when we were about to finish the second entry dish  the price of bread basket was 35 kwai +15 service for 6 slices of bread that just left the fridge and wasnt even heated  that makes the price of a slice about 1 euro  jack pot for the owner beer arrived later and it looked like everything was settled in the end  but  we were still eating soup when mains came out  so when we got to the grilled meats part they were already barely warm so the question remains what is this service that we had to pay 15 on top of the bill no even hi or sorry or bye  not even speaking about other issues i described here  to be frank  we liked the food and that somehow left a bit of positive impression but the �service� ruined the majority of it please rename this venue from �red square� into �great wall� as the latter would more accurately describe the way they treat customers  my friends in shanghai often ask me to recommend a good russian restaurant and i always used to send them to red square now i feel shame of myself for doing that this place is a disgrace to russian hospitality and ill never put my feet into it again, excellent introduction to russian food
amazing russian atmosphere most impressive  reach decoration inside
tasty food homemade drinks as well surprised at the good price for alcohol they even have russian bear
friendly foreign management  great thanks, located in a weird compound the food is russian inspired but just ok nothing fancy the servers need training the decoration seems need renewing, perhaps it was my fault to grab some friends to go a russian restaurant obviously a lot of russian loved this restaurant but rarely happened with foreigners
we waited the first drink for a while after 15minutes the waiter just realized he had missed our order no apology then the hot dishes were not 100 served in the right temperature some of them even cold when we wanted to talk with the manager was told not on duty we left the comments and paid full amount of the bill and go and never come back again, hi i very like russian food and it was surprise to me to find this restaurant food was delicious to note is separate i want check a service it was very nice and friendly atmosphere also was very cool, last week my friends and i visited the restaurant red square and was very pleasedit was my birthdaythe cozy atmosphere and beautiful interior chefs are creating real masterpieces of culinary artvery beautiful and original dishi want to note the attention and great service staffthe administration has made a 30 discount in honor of the birthday and got a bottle of champagnewe smoked one of the best hookahs in shanghailive music in the restaurant on a very high and professional levelin general the service and atmosphere made our stay unforgettable all advise, to those typical russian they may like it as this is one of a very few russian restaurant in shanghai to anybody else theres nothing impressive and good
unfriendly service and undercooked food made us very uncomfortable after 1 hour we spent here no one knows how to treat their guest better and no one cares
a big ignore, we visited this location which is a little difficult to find in the former abattoir first you would not expect a russian restaurant in this a little remote area to be so good  but it is its actually for me one of the best restaurants in shanghai  we were there four times during a period of six months quality of food drinks and service was consistenly on all occasions very good  we had various type of food some of the dishes several times smoked fish cured fish salad potatoe salad cold yoghurt and kwass soup with herbs russian dumpling pelmeni with various filling veal in cream sauce  layered sweet cakes russian imported beer mutiple vodkas not a single dish came on any of the visit with any limitation its all declious russian food the service was friendly and professional and very helpful  if you are not experienced in russian style dinner trust the service  only limitation for some  they have russian live pop music on fridays  i like this but maybe too loud for families with small kidsin this case go another day  but go there  , this place is cool very russian my wife russian my young kids are learning to speak russian ive been to russia many times and this place is a great home away from home in china they also sponsor many community and cultural events which makes it a special place the building and shops in the area are also worth a visit, delicious food and friendly service try russian borscht  they cook it really good and russian salads seld pod shuboi  herring fish salad is my favourite enjoy, food is very delicious hearty service i had borsch and beefstroganoff and mashed potato borsch was awesome even more tasty than i had in russia also they have free wifi, good for taste smth new russian cuisine is different from european taste was good we ordered lamb kebab olivie salad bortsh and traditional cake for dessert honey cake atmosphere was good but a little loud there was life music service was good managers and waiters were very friendly prices are same with other notchinese restaurants in shanghai, it is located hongkou district 10 shajing road the place is very big and finely furnished i have to admit that they make the place look very classy
the general atmosphere was very relaxing and appetising

they have everything tons of options russian ukrainian western food desserts and even good shisha

i genuinely recommend that you go there as well it�s the best place you can get for eating the food is good the place looks nice and the price is surprisingly affordable it was not our first visit to this restaurant and it never disappoints, after 5 years of living abroad red square is one of best russia restaurant among the whole oceania n asia area in my list with no doubt solyanka was amazing almost the same as my grannys one moreover im falling inlove with lamb kebab and lamb chops the service is professional and quick i deffinetly saw that the waiter loved what he hadbeen doing forevery customer the shot of vodka is offered frankly speaking the vodkais really good thank you red square for great evening, this was our first visit to red square it was a little difficult to find but once we got there the location and the decor was excellent there was live music and the overall atmosphere was relaxing yet festive there was a party of 20 which made service slow we had borscht lamb chops smoked salmon and a beef stew type dish along with dessert

the service was very poor i hope it was due to the party of 20 it took 40 minutes to get our drinks turns out they were delivered to wrong table and sat there 10 minutes before they brought them to our table we asked for fresh drinks

the food was above average and the menu was interesting enough to return the price was reasonable they do provide free vodka shots and they offered us free dessert due to our service issues

we will return and it is worth a visit i rated it very good assuming the poor service was due to party of 20, red square restaurant has offered excellent service when i have eaten there the environment is very dressy and professional and the waiters are friendly and quick the wait time is average and in my experience dining at red square i would estimate the average wait time to be around 15 minutes
after dining at red square i would definitely recommend this restaurant as one of the best fine dining restaurants in shanghai the food is very elegant and tastes great as well the environment is also very elegant which makes red
square the perfect place to go
for a romantic dinner date or to go with your family even for coffee or tea break with a delicious desserts sure ill come back soon, last night tired of terrible street stuffiness i again came to the restaurant red square and i was very pleased that after two months of absence i found that me still here remember

i was greeted with a smile very charming restaurant hostess anastasia and my mood which until then was at zero immediately rose very quickly

i found here is not only hiding place from the heat but also admired the wonderful food and drinks indeed the food and drinks here  just amazing delicious

and for that separately stands to shake hands with the cook named telman who able not only to convey to us traditional tastes of different nations and continents but and share his cooking secrets

i also was very pleased with the coordinated work of staff quick and polite waiters which bears all the work from the reception of orders  unto serving and serve meals at the end of the evening me have offered to pick up the remaining products and helped to pack all

but especially a lot warm words i want to say about the musical entertainment program which is carried out by the duo which includes super musicians max and alisa these russian musicians  believe me  exactly to nobody do not give miss especially when they begin to danceset sit still nobody can namely musicians their skill and wellchosen repertoire combine all that revolves around but the interesting thing is that any guest unashamedly can join and sing along with them

in short everything here is done for the people and it is captivating

restaurant red square  this sole the place among all russian restaurant in shanghai where to go pleasurably and then recollect do not be ashamed

gennady, nice atmosphere and servicehad a fantastic birthday there thank you to the team of red square, its no doubt the best russian restaurant in shanghai
its a bit expensive especially if you think that youre in china the country where food is so cheap but the price is worth it 99 of the meals are exquisite

i can compare their watersmoking shisha just with 1000 nights arabian restaurant and sometimes it even better

i would recommend this place for russian expats living abroad and every foreigner how wants to try the real russian food and drinks, this is by far the best russian restaurant ive ever been to and ive lived in china for 14+ years and gone to many places in the north where they are way more popular red square is definitely not your average steaksoups russian joint it has a very nice atmosphere hiding in a mysteriouslooking old building where you have to find your way along long corridors

but seriously go for the food the restaurant includes cuisine from all the regions of russia and it invites you to go several times to try the incredibly varied menu do try the lamb in any of its dishes as well as the seafood just too good for words

also they have a great wine selection do not miss this place next time you are in shanghai, visiting shanghai every summer i have been attending red square on every trip i have to say that i have always loved the food since it is that rare case when the authentic cuisine is actually represented at its best but most importantly what i have recently witnessed is that the restaurant has changed to the better the service has been dramatically improved the staff is welltrained and truly welcoming the interior atmoshere is also much better the restaurant is really clean and bright and of course the evening performances and diverse thematic events and parties are always a good idea
definitely a mustvisit place in the very heart of shanghai, its definitely surprising experience for me my first impression i got from the restaurant location  a mysterious historic building with outstanding design its like a kind of barcelona castle looking magnificent in the evening

i would say red square has art  modern russian cuisine lovely atmosphere with a little touch of oriental influence by shisha menu offer its also the biggest russian restaurant in shanghai

we ordered traditional crepes blini with red caviar excellent and delicate mild curd salmon beer boiled crawfish gourmet taste flavoured with beer and dill pike caviar my first time i found it in china incredible salad very similar to greek salad and of cause russian borsch which is very famous soup around the world one of the national soups of russia  hearty fish soup or ukha there is a big choice of kebab style meet in the menu as well

my heart was stolen by assorted dessert platter with a choice of delicious cakes and romantic candles i also would recommend collavini sauvignion blancfumat  italian fruity white wine from the bar menu and absolutely fancy mango mojito

live band performance was great i will be back to red square to have a wonderful time and continue my russian cuisine journey, really russiantaste food nice interior and friendly staff
reccomend for those who miss native food being in china as well for oversease willing to try russian cousine, this place has an authentic russian old atmosphere and located in an unusual place  1933 building live sound events i visited a wine tasting event that night beautiful tsarstyle design this definitely worth visiting the food is excellent dumplings baked with chess high class vodka one of the best hookah in shanghai borsch service was very good no issues, brought my wife as she previously lived in russia and loves russian food

we both really enjoyed the food both her chicken kiev and my beef stroganoff were excellent also surprisingly good was the herring appetizer i would go back for any of these dishes

desserts were ok but nothing special

service could be improved the waitress couldnt tell us what aspic was so we ordered that appetizer and were disappointed by the jello like food that arrived  forgivable though as she clearly didnt speak english and we were of course in china that said we were the only customers in the restaurant so she should have gone to get an english speaking staff person to help as well when another waitress brought us new utensils she did not grab them from the tray by the handles but instead by the eating side of the forkknifespoon totally unhygenic and basic service 101 faux pas

free vodka shots were awesome though

we would go back for the food but please iron out the service, having read reviews on diningcity and tripadvisor the food sounded interesting the restaurant is on the third level of the 1933 building in hongkou district and has an interesting layout and archictecture having been used as an abbatoir in the early days

we started with potato salad though well presented in a martinitype glass it was rather ordinary in taste the borsch soup was quite delicious boasting beef slivers with beetroot and cabbage rather than just red and white cabbage as youc an find at other restaurants we only wished that the sour cream was well more sour as that would have further enhanced the taste of the soup the garlic bread that came with the soup was hard and cold but we found it useful to dunk in the main course of beef and potato in a hot stew pot this was good too and very filling

dessert was crepes with sour cream but this was disappointing the crepe tasted a little odd and the sour cream was not sour

all in all a interesting meal you should try it for something different in taste as well as to visit the 1933 building

service was okay though a little slow when more patrons began coming in, had lunch here most things shared by me and my friend were pretty good beetroot salad borsch dumpling etc the beet root salad was a bit too much beets needs more balance maybe we should have taken another one as well
all in all reasonably priced decent food service a bit russian not super friendly but still reasonable likely to go later especially when warmer and going for dinner+some more drinks, given my husbands longtime affair with russia ive made it sort of my personal mission to find russian food places wherever we go i found about this place on a shanghai city guide and decided we would take a night from october break to go check it out to get there by train i believe you can take either line 4 or line 10 with roughly 10 minute walks from the nearest stations red square is located in a super cool artsy building literally organized in rings on the inside there are other eateries in the building that look quite interesting so well be back for more haha
the hallway to red square is decorated with light that make a russian flag on the inside id say its decorated in ornate russian style very pretty i do not recommend showing up without a reservation place was busy but we arrived early at 630 or so and were shown a table for two in no time
the menu thank goodness is more extensive than what you see on their website and has all the russian goodies ive come to love it also has some ukranian dishes the wait staff is primarily russian or ukranian they all speak english and russian of course  i always check so i can make my husband practice  ive found across the board that russian wait staff really appreciates when you try to speak a little russian with them
anyways on to the food i didnt really order borscht but my husband did and i guess someone misunderstood and brought two dishes with a side of garlic bread both fresh the soup was perfectly prepared and they brought the sour cream on the side that was nice because not everyone is crazy about sour cream like me i ordered this dish of meat and potatoes that came in a clay pot that arrived before anything else so i ate my soup after i had my entree it was kind of funny
my husband ordered beef stroganoff time went by fortyfive minutes later i told him we should ask what was going on in the end from the time we ordered to the time he got his entree it had been an hour they did offer to prepare something else for him for free but as he was getting ready to order something else word came from the kitchen that it would be ready in 5 it was they still offered us some free beers for our troubles
we had ordered some ukranian beer per the waitress suggestion earlier and it was great also it was the first truly cold beer we had had in china in almost 3 months here
i had read some reviews in other places complaining about the russian techno we happen to like it so its not a problem for us i wasnt so crazy about the dude singing karaoke in russian
prices are pretty reasonable there are some pricey items but hey you dont have to order them if you dont want to food is good which is the important part i think well be back for my husbands birthday so he can judge the caviar
it was nice to find a place with good russian food here its comforting and delicious we definitely recommend this place, this restaurant in shanghai is something special when you live for a long time in shanghai and you miss russian food or if you want to treat yourself with yummi deserts or good wine  it is the best place for you red square serves real russian dishes outstanding deserts and has such a wide range of wines  you will be surprised yesterday there was a kind of raffle prizes and i won a romantic dinner in red square one friend of mine won 20 discount and the other won a club card with 17 discount the show was amazing i love this place, if you wish to get impression related to russian cousine or obtain good dinner or lunch  it is a proper choice there is 3 languages menu  chinese russian english russian waiters can give suggestions and the taste of dishes is authentic as if prepared in russia what is exciting because in china always dishes ala western style contain chinese chefs trace  excessive oil spices atypical for declared recipe pleasant environment  russian style decorated space
good choice of alcohol drinks coktails payment by credit cards chinese official receipts fapiao  available
for me who is living in china several years continuously  it is the home away from home, believed last reviews and dropped by first time was by myself two years ago  this time brought my bf  we just got engaged  for engagement dinner it was splendid staff was so sweet and nice they gave the best service to us some russian sparkling for free to celebrate our engagement and even flowers to me absolutely made our day, was here a year or so ago since that time didnt feel like getting that ugly experience again but this time my buddys gf dragged us here  shes russian it was surprisingly different and much much better  impressed by changes food delicious though a little thick but good we had beefsteaks grilled salmon and of course traditional russian dumplings baked in a pot with cheese  guys said they changed kitchen staff completely new chief refreshed menu  really good we stayed later than midnight singer stayed singing for us even club dancing songs  our girls wanted to dance and we couldnt leave  personnel of the restaurants didnt push us out of the door they served us friendly and so warmly wondered how places can get reborn, red square has wonderful food and very good service every night there are live shows and most are quite nice the bar is well stocked and the food fresh and clean the view from the 1933 building is quite amazing i would recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in trying something a little different for dinner that having been said the prices are a bit high and they seem to raise them each time i go but all in all it is a great expereince",NA,NA
334,"located in french concession on taojiang road just next door to its sister restaurant la creperie la cabane offers some very traditional french food and some savoyard cheese specialities such as raclette fondue or tartiflette it is very appealing during winter especially with friends decoration will remind you of a french alpine ski lodge unfortunately without the snow pricequality ratio is good service is good too overall probably the best place to go in shanghai if you are craving for savoyard cheese, i love la cabane i stumbled in here one afternoon just to have a drink but the moment i looked at the menu i knew it was going to be delicious the menu has raclette tartiflette and fondu its a little taste of france in shanghai

this place would be perfect for date night because the raclette is really involved and would be a lot of fun to try with someone

the owner came over to our table and was super friendly and personable the staff is also very friendly and mostly french i can see this becoming one of my favorite places in shanghai, good place for friends and family visits

traditional french food and atmosphere which makes it always fun to go there with friends or family, i like the location of this place because its in the french concession and it feels like a little corner of europe maybe one of the best places to go in shanghai for raclette it has a cozy atmosphere nice music and not pretentious at all i think the raclette price is very reasonable considering how expensive cheese is in china friendly staff nice place also for happy hour wine a bit pricey, honestly this is not a bad place at all but i expected a little bit more from a place in such a nice location decent selection of belgian beers but slightly overpriced for the area, the terrasse outside is really nice staff was friendly and food was correct but a bit too expensive for what it is, this restaurant served us brilliant food at a good price the service was fast and helpful they spoke french chinese and english overall we had a really good experience, we went to la cabane because la creperie next to it was crowded first strange feeling la cabanes atmosphere is one of a refuge in the alps quite strange when it is 45 degrees outside we liked the awkwardness of it though
the service is good without being groundbreaking but it goes well with the refuge concept i think
the food is also interesting fondues tartiflette again odd when it is 45 degrees outside however the salads were good and the kids options were highly adopted by our 2 sons
overall a good experience well come back in the winter for some real alpine specialties this time, we had brunch on weekend there are 4 brunch sets to choose from we had salad and burger food were okay but nothing amazing they have a great selection of wine we ordered rose wine which is reasonably priced service was fine too with 2 french ladies there we sat on outside weather was nice not a busy street just occasion big trucks passby on the road in front of the restaurant, went twice during business stays in shanghai great food eg perigourdine salad with its foie gras with good atmosphere and servicewill be back, charming restaurant on a small square in the french concession had an excellent croque madame the open wine selection was limited with the reds very bordeaux oriented very freindly staff and very nice atmosphere, good food and drinks but pretty expensive 228 rmb for a 300 grams cheese fondue there are some outdoor tables where you can enjoy the shanghainese spring weather, friendly staff especially since new manager julie joined the crew food is very good and prices are reasonable also wine selection is good and not overpriced appetizers cheese dishes steaks deserts are excellent i have not tried the fondue if youre in shanghai and miss some cheese delight def worth it

it shows a lot of effort has gone into menu decor and so on the menu always gets spiced up every week with dailys and specials

good place, maybe one of the best places to go in winter in shanghai great value for the money considering how expensive cheese is in shanghai staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is very warm like in the mountains in france you must try it if you havent already, went there several times for different occasions
~ have some rose wine outside during summer enjoyed the great happy hour deal buy 1 bottle get 1 free
wine is ice cold refreshing streets are quietish > good time
~ salad  duck magret during autumn
dishes are a bit pricey ~100rmb but definitely worth it quantity is enough meat is nicely cooked
~ burger for brunch the one with foie gras is  bbrraaaaaahhhh
you get there still hungover just eat it and youll feel better 
probably requests a nap after 
~ raclette as winter is coming o
melted cheese + potatoe = <3 <3 <3
enjoy just enjoy 
they even offered the digestif at the end of dinner =

overall real cool place  they adjust the menu according to seasons
special deals  swag people > nice place to hang, i am french and after 3 years in china i miss my gastronomy sometimes this restaurant is one of the best french restaurant in town and its a french girl who says it especially during winter because it is exactly like if you were in the alpes in a nice and warm chalet on the french mountains

i shared a big raclette with some friends a very famous french dish with lot of cheese and cold cut which was sooo good and i also tried another time the duck magretso great to find good meat in shanghai
on mondays they have a special deal on moules it is a good opportunity to try this other very famous french dish from north of france

even if winter is a great period to try la cabanne i also love to enjoy the terrace they have during summer with a glass of rose and a fresh salad very nice atmosphere during spring and summer after work on the terrace

the location of this restaurant is perfect right in the middle of the former french concession after your dinner you can go for a walk visiting the lovely streets of the french concession

all these words to say that its a must try in shanghai you wont be disappointed, not quite sure about calling it french but the food is reasonable a little smoky inside with a relaxed cafe restaurant feel when we went the staff were friendly but the food was slow to arrive, went there for diner in opening period service was a little slow but they told us food was good and we had good time try their steaks, they have a nice spot good outdoor seating and indoor seating clean space pretty bad service it was not busy at all but the girl kept forgetting our drinks and items ordered the cocktails were pretty bad not a balanced mixed drink basil smash and caipirinha the starter was ok not horrible but not great either mixed platter i ordered the duck it was a bit overcooked for duck we tried to order coffee at the end of our meal but they said they turned off the coffee machine and the restaurant was closed odd because we were 1 of 3 tables left occupied also coffee is so easy why shut it off odd but all in all its a dressed up cafe no reason for us to try again, i am french and i think this is a ripoff the fondue pot is almost empty and never the same sometimes too liquid sometimes too heavy in alcohol the service isnt good waiters have an atitute except for the chinese girl who works there i wont go again too expensive for potatoes and cheese, the vosgienne salad was so beautifulcolorful and tasteful certainly not light but one of the tastiest salad ive ever had in shanghai the toast were also great the cheese the truffle  everythings well prepared and again tasty the fondue was small but actually enough for 23 it reminded me the fondues i had back in france well done for the authenticity the decor is interesting too it looks like you are in chalet in the alps
you must try their draft beer delirium refreshing
a full review will follow soon
i recommend, this place has been opened for a bit more than a month i�ve already been there like 10 times
what should i say 
you know how frustrating it is going to french restaurants and have tiny portions of food under the excuse that those are �fine dining�
this place is the total opposite
whatever you order  the duck magret the salads the toasts the beef steak every single dish is served xxl for a reasonable price
on top of having excellent and large portions of food served they serve good cocktails and � delirium beer on draft  i was so happy to find that beer in there quite unexpected i must say as it�s a french restaurant but still probably one of the only place in shanghai you can find that beer at
their terrasse is pretty amazing right in front of a small park
agreed with another comment below the �mama yoyo� sandwich is probably the best in town
decoration is simple but nice
merci , the food here is not impressive at all truly rude french service perhaps we did not spend a fortune here got served wrong dishes the fact no one realized and said sorry it happens to the table next to us too
there are plenty of french bistros in shanghai this one definite not competitive to any of them, im a french who has been living in shanghai for four months although i really like the chinese cuisine i wanted to eat some french food with my chinese colleague la cabana seemed to be the best choice as i wanted my friend to experience the real french food with a good raclette cheese fondue salad vosgienne and more

i went there two weeks ago and i relished it and so did my colleague their dishes arent particularly difficult but they are succulent nonetheless

a couple of days ago i decided to invite two chinese friends to eat french food and there was no way i could choose another restaurant after this successful first time ordered the raclette again as i believe every chinese should eat this dish they loved it they found it quite original

what to say about the managers of the restaurant they are simply amazing got the chance to talk with thomas on several occasions hes a great person who is willing to listen to any criticism good and bad that you have he will also talk to his clientele and make sure everything is fine rarely in my life have i experienced such kindness and attention from the manager of a restaurant

although im praising them a lot right now i do have a couple of negatives the fact that they dont accept the credit card is a tiny annoying that said there is a icbc like 200 meters away so its all good my other complaint is that some dishes take really some times to arrive i had to wait around 20 minutes between the salad and the raclette which is actually fine with me but maybe not for chinese who usually have all their dishes on their table

to sum this up if tripadvisor had an option to add a sixth star with the label fantastic i would definitely use it

ps i strongly suggest anyone to go there in a week or two as their summer menu is about to be available and from what thomas told me its going to be one that will gain you a few kilos 

thanks again for the amazing time see you next week, i was advised by some friends to check this place out especially for the awesome cheese dishes there
however that night i was not craving cheese at all yes it happens to the best of us i decided to go for the sandwiches and toasts i took the mama yoyo sandwich and damn best sandwich in shanghai i swear my friends had the duck magret only heard good feedback and we ordered the french fries to accompany and again it made the top 3 best french fries in shanghai crispy outside soft inside potatoe taste i am definitely going back there to taste the rest of the food it was just so comforting , i was there for drink and dinner i got table outside its very few place where you can eat outside in shanghai
food was good and the draft delirium beer is excellent",NA,NA
335,"the place is very nice the environment remember a classical american fast food and the food is also very good and well prepared the calamari is very tasty and the hamburgers are the main attractions of a very consistent menu i recommend the gigantic double beef burger wrapped in bacon slices a complete and amazing meal, went to blue frog with an expat friend who recommended the place vs my initial idea of hooters across the street  he claimed the food was better anyway
had an excellent cobb salad with a great mustard based dressing  and a few tiger beers on tap  service was fast and correct  the place was lively without being packed  good mix of expats and locals good place for beers and a hearty meal would go again, i believe blue frog chains serve consistently great tasting food my friends ordered the mexican burger spicy chicken burger and fajitas while i had the soft shell crab salad we were very happy with the food and the final price came to rmb 389 which is a great price

before that though we waited very very long 1 dish came and the other 3 took very long we asked the waiter and he replied nicely that everyone is waiting not faulting the service staff at all but i guess they need to improve the kitchen hmm after our food came we had to remind the service staff that our drinks just iced tea really have not arrived

i think its just that this outlet is really packed which generates great atmosphere and i heard that its much faster at the swfc outlet otherwise no complaints with the food at all and i believe i will come back for their burgers again maybe at the other outlet though, been here many times for an early dinner with the family and friendsalways good wholesome quality great happy hour 24 1 always good imported quality meat on offer, relaxing atmosphere good service and fabulous burgers 
great place for sunday brunch
various wine and beer selections, good place for hot lunch or quick diner went twice first was pasta from the special winter menu 2nd burger good quality both times not fast food, located behind the shangrila on the bund and very close to the paulaner beer housemathis is the perfect place for westerners to drop by for lunch dinner or just beers  coffee, the food is tasty a pretty authentic north american menu good drink specials while not inexpensive the prices are reasonable for the quality service has always been superb, you will find a nice menu selection and an assortment of beer and cocktails for any tastes the decor is very nice and casual and they add a good selection of music to give it a fun atmosphere good stopping place and the price is not bad either, excellent evening dinner really enjoyed the menu and the offerings drinks were cold and food warm worth the visit, the food quality is over standardthe varaity of it menuethe outside dining also you can see all your friends",NA,NA
336,"they have some pretty decent vegetarianvegan options which promoted me to visit this place the thai curry was really satisfying with loads of flavours and the pineapplecoconut fresh juice was delicious, i just stopped here for a quick snack i got the portuguese chorizo soup and it was very tasty service was great, if youre looking for something healthy between all the other scrumptious delights in shanghai the sprouworks is definitely the answer they have a wide selection of healthy meal options to tempt even the biggest sweet tooth the prices are relatively reasonable and there is almost no waiting time for your food, great place to grab a salad and some healthy sides eg kale quinoa sweet potatoes it is not the most beautiful place to sit basement of a mall but for food togo it is perfect, we mainly order from the app from this restaurant for home delivery but weve also eaten in the restaurant a few times this is the best healthy food in shanghai and also some of the best value for money the restaurant is nice and clean and the service is quick id recommend sproutworks to anyone trying to find healthy or vegetarian food in shanghai or just something a little different, its a chain with 45 outlets healthy food a lot of vegetbles good salads on a bar with lots of options also has soups and meatsfish small menu for these but tasty pics below of salads on offer, absolutely love it fantastic food perfect for health nuts an vegetarians freshly made and warm service near the pudong tower and accessible via the underground train services, i think sproutworks is great at mixing random and healthy vegetables to make really tasty side dishes we stopped by for a quick dinner in the mall and i was not disappointed by my classmates gossip about this place

the as i remember three sides set will definitely keep you very full and save you some time and money its quick efficient tasty and healthy although i did notice it was a little oily
however my boyfriend did not have a great time not only did he spill his dish and had to buy another but he was also not a great fan of the excessively healthy meals perhaps for some people who do not like to eat too much vegetables should avoid this restaurants they do have meat though but very healthy meat, three of us had lunch at the sproutworks outlet in xin tian di excellent salads and a good range of a protein based side dish only small negative is that we found the fruit juices to be in the pricy side, omgeeeeeee fell in love with this place so much so i went back for 2nds and thirds i ate at the xin tiandi location then ventured to the one in pudong at the super brand mall the xin tiandi one has outdoor seating the offerings are delicious and the servings are huge the options change daily so i had a chance to try several picks this place is all natural and preservative free i also had a serving of the brown rice
i always get the 4sides set for 45<u+00a5> because there are so many options to chose from next time ill try something else its actually a boatload of food enough for two i love the healthy food concept and appreciate that this company is eco friendly while visiting shanghai i ate at this place numerous times for lunch and dinner i also ate at element fresh, update  they moved to lujiazui super brand mall basement these guys have the best veggie sides and sandwiches in town delicious filling and healthy what more can you ask for it is self serve but the food is pretty nice a good place to grab lunch and dinner, i was feeling under the weather suffering with flu off my food and not knowing what to eat all i wanted was fresh fruit and vegetables thank you sproutworks what an amazing eaterie i stumbled across the restaurant by chance when visiting the superbrand mall pudong and i took a look at the counter impressive display of salads and panini a great selection what made the difference though was the chef behind the counter who spoke english and made me feel welcome i tried the lamb confit panini with sides of a crunchy salad which contained lotus root carrot and was excellent accompanied by a sweet corn and endame bean salad exactly what the doctor ordered after i paid my bill i discovered a salad of shredded brussels sprouts and anchovy which i will be returning for later in the week

looking for fresh wholesome and healthy sprout works is the place to be, this branch of sproutworks has closed as of december 1 2013 there is another branch across the river in pudong and plans to open others in the summer

a shame as a detox day after a hard night out indulging in cocktails and shanghai pollution was always well positioned to succeed with a meal here included details for the buffet style servings and daily offerings as noted by others are all accurate

if youll be in pudong for work or play search for that branch to grab a healthy meal, great salads and side dishes with some vegetables that you can rarely find in shanghai if youre looking for fresh healthy salads and sandwiches this is one of the best choices in shanghai, this place is perfect for lunch but i dont know if its my luck or the place is always this busy but every time i go to sproutworks i wait ages to order the food is pretty nice and light qinoa salad is very interesting id recomend it for sure, i was not so impressed by the food i was looking for a healthier lunch option in shanghai i stood at the counter for about 10 minutes thinking of either getting a chicken soup or just walk out of the place all the so called salads looked like they have been sitting for a long while finally i settled for caesar salad and chicken soup as nothing looked appealing i found hair in my salad i tried my friends and was disappointed the food was flavorless i was surprised by all the hype the only good thing there was their lemonade anyway after the experience i talked to a few people and they definitely said that the restaurant used to be much better when it first opened i hope they kick it up a notch, i discovered this place on a saturday morning walk on chang le rd the house looks likes a private museum with its own ecosystem you can sit in the sunshine without sweating nor freaking airconditioning in sh its the idea place for saturday brunch as long as you do not mind stay away from meat for a while with only 60yuan per person you can enjoy 4 options of salads and 2 drinks the salads are full of ingredients and naturally colorful i cannot say thats the best salad ever but it has been very inspiring to lazy people like me in terms of cooking and eating healthy

theres another branch in pudong which seems to be less promising, i am temporarily based in shanghai and have visited sproutworks at the intersection of donghu lu and xinle lu for a meal again and again

the reason is simple it offers a great variety of healthy tasty food options the restaurant concept is casual and yet comfortable you line up at the counter place your order out of the large selection of salads and other choices in front of you pay for it take it in a tray and you find a seat to eat

sproutworks is one of the best choices for casual lunch in the xuhui area and definitely for me the best option for healthy tasty food i have discovered so far in shanghai, this is one of my favorite lunch restaurants in all of shanghai for 5560rmb you have 5 lunch special options that leave you feeling fullin a good way the selection of salads healthy sides and paninis are second to none  i would eat here every day if i could but im typically only there twice a week, our friends suggested sproutworks and we returned for lunch 2 days after our first visit the selection was large the food was fresh and the staff were accommodatingnot much more i could ask for in sh i felt like i was eating safe healthy foodliving in sh for over a year i tend to shy away from uncooked vegetables for obvious reasons no problems with their salads or veggies the daily panini options are a real treatvery tasty they have set lunch meals with free flow elderflower lemonade for a small addersuper yummy the servings are more than reasonable for 60rmb <$10usd i had enough for 2 lunchesand it was just as good the second time around cant wait to go backi wish they had a frequent diner program, as vegetariansshamefaced foodies weve been somewhat stumped for healthy tasty things to eat in china i mean theres always hotpot but finding the sproutworks in the super brand mall it was hot so sue us was like coming home colour and taste veggies and fruits and seeds all shoved into tasteful proximity wonderful and the staff are super friendly too
all told hooray, i had been traveling around china and i was extremely hungry for a great salad i felt so satisfied i went there 3 days in a row i really had a super hunger for good healthy food every day i had something different i left each day feeling comfortable and back to my normal eating pattern i cannot express my thanks to sprout works for doing such a great job i wish i could find a restaurant like it in america i would be a regular, we enjoyed a lunchtime meal here on a recent trip to shanghai the staff were very helpful and the decor and ambience of the place was wonderful there were a range of dishes to choose from and each one was fresh very tasty and wellcooked would definitely return, my friends and i love eating at sprout works the only problem is there is not enough room to sit but there is a small park diagonal from the restaurant and we go eat there great choices for healthy food you pick a salad and 24 sides sides range from sweet potatoes to soybeans great choices and i have to say the owners are lovely people, sprout works has a tasty range of food for a great price it is a small modern restaurant with take away service if you want to eat at home, nice addition to the shanghai restaurant scene for residents more catered for the lunch and work crowd in the area it offers some simple set options with nice organic veggie  panini salad options you get in line pick your set choose a nice selection of 18 or so veggiespasta selections couscous buttersquash okra etc selfservice all the way including the nice reminder to clear your own trays which feels a bit canteenish

location great right in the heart of younger part of french concession donghufuminchangle lu

food very healthy and organic good selection including the panini if you are craving a bit more meat drink bar is very nice with unique mix of teas and lemonades

atmosphere nice more of a eat your food and go place given the tables are placed around a rock garden that must be part of the hotel a bit of a pain to find a seat if you come during the week right a lunch time so be ready to share a table

service very good its selfservice but the folks and managementowners are all together serving the customers which is good

value very good 50rmb60rmb for a set without drink

occasions lunch work crowd quick lunch meet up place with friends

in summary a nice lunch destination especially if you work in the area but also for residents in the french concession if you are a vegan tourist then you may want to make this a destination great concept in this ever changing fb scene in shanghai nice change to the wagaselements food weve been fed all these years, this place offers four standard salads every day two sandwiches which change daily and soups and sides that also change daily there are also three to four protein options that can be added to your meal

friendly staff that interacts well with the expat contingent

salad approx 30rmb sandwiches 38 a real affordable and tasty find in shanghai, after a big weekend partying and staying up late this place and all the wonderful food on the menu is just what the doctor ordered
fresh healthy green flavorsome light and different sproutworks offers and crisp and healthy alternative to the oily chinese food and expensive western food in shanghai
sproutworks offers small medium and large salads with lots of different side like tofu fish chicken etc
the premises is open and airy and the service friendly and chilled out

really enjoyed it and we will be back, sproutworks in a nice concept and healthy food the salad mix is good and variety  the selection of ice tea is good and the unlimited ice tea offer is good exp for lazy summer afternoons now a good place for a weekend brunch the seating is quite good and peaceful with interesting decor location is good and offers good views of roadsmust visit for health conscious gym going people, sproutworks is a welcome addition to healthy eating scene which is in desperate need of fresh blood everything about this place is awesome the food is well marked so you know what is in it they have vegan and veg options and if you bring your own container for takeaway then you get an ecodiscount of 5 more importantly they dont look at you like you are weird for bringing your own container drinks come in jam jars which is a nice touch
there are two small things that could be improved upon space there needs to be more and the napkins are bleached why not use unbleached napkins seeing as everything else is eco, fantastic idea for a restaurant well thought out and put together good decor

ample portions and lots of verity to choice from some of the salad options were very good and i liked the way you could try different options  4 salads at one go

serves beer and wine

ended up eating there three times as i stayed local only complaint was they ran out of steak on two of the, a great find and unusually for this part of the city quite inexpensive the servicei went there at about 2000h and in 5 mins was eating i had the panini of the day goats cheese and eggplant and 2 side dishes of veggies i did not find then over dressed and in fact added oil vinegar and tabasco to both of the sides quite enough food for me and the cost 58rmb i noted the customer ordering ahead of me had 4 sides which looked like a huge appetizing meal and that was an unbelievable 35rmb",NA,NA

nice little place with great turkis foods good service and affordable prices  do not forget to try efes beer and doner kebab good appetite, we had a breakfast with couple of friends perfect service and nice food especially i suggest everyone to have some baklava thanks, very delicious foods and most authentic restaurant in town with fresh and quality ingredients they do miracles service is friendly and professional nice to be here and will be back soon, i shared a turkish breakfast with a friend supplemented by hummus and several dishes were delicious the eggs had something added to give it a savory flavor that i couldnt identify the goat cheese was pleasingly tart and there was an eggplanttomatowalnut mixture that was new to me there was plenty of food and im sorry that we couldnt finish it you dont go away hungry at this restaurant, we met another couple for dinner early in the evening and each had a great meal the food and price were a 4 but the service was a 3 the seating can be very cramped server bumping you repeatedly overall it was more cozy than annoying due in part to the dinner guests but it could be distracting for two people having an intimate dinner

recommendations
 make reservations
 for two people ask for the balcony it has a great view over the street below
 beyti kebab<u+0131> and tavuk beyti kebab<u+0131> were both excellent and had the most food to serve

about the experience
like most places in shanghai you need to let the staff know when you are ready to order once we placed our 4 orders the staff forgot about our drinks for 20min until we reminded them the appetizers came out quickly though there was not enough bread for the two dips were ordered the muhammara and ac<u+0131>l<u+0131> ezme tasted similar though one was cold and the other was warm suggest a hummus and muhammara mix and extra bread there is low seating like a foot stoolbackless and one becnh seat so people with bad backs may have an issue
overall we had an enjoyable evening and the staff were friendly though a bit overwhelmed at times for such a seemingly small space we would all go back though as the food was good and the staff were quick to respond when we identified something we needed, have been there for dinner with some friends and i must say it was really good
the quality and also the variety of the food is perfect
nice and small restaurant in an non crowded area, thank to pasha team for hospitality and delicios turkish foods which is the number one of shanghai  you should add this fantastic restaurant to your favorite place list we have already missed turkish kebap and rak<u+0131>  sure we will visit you soon warm regards, a cozy place with nice decoration excellent food and friendly staff you must add pashs into your favorites list to be visited in shanghai with its convenient location delicious kebabs  kind of minced beef  must be tried with several types of appetizers traditional drink ayran is a good choice for a nonalcoholic menu if you wanna go on a strong spirit just order a bottle of rak<u+0131> worth to note it is cheaper compared to local pubs in turkey thanks again for the courtesy of owners we will certainly visit this family restaurant on our next trip to china, hidden in the small lanes of pushi is this wonderful restaurant with modern interiors and cosy setting its a small busy place so do make reservations in advance we were there for lunch and ordered the chicken kebab lamb kebab and beef minced seekh as an accompaniment we had stuffed mushrooms with cheese

each item was beautifully presented and had a distinct turkish flavour given birth over charcoals the meats were succulent and well seasoned

absolutely a delight, what a relief to drink again ayran and eat cacik after several months they should write exactly from which animal the meat is and not just meat as it is the case for some dishes pasha is offering the turkish efes beer and a new brand called brander urstoff an excellent german lager beer freshly made in china from german raw materials and german expertise psha is soon opening a second outlet watch out, the best turkish food in shanghai epically iskandar meal
the nearest point to it is exit 4 on south shanxi road line number on 
when you exist from exit 4 take right then the first left go ahead you will find it on the left hand, pasha is my favorite turkish restaurant in shanghai i am often there its pricing is $$$ which fully corresponds to their high quality this place gives you a chance to enjoy a delicious food in the best turkish traditions together with cozy comfortable atmosphere created by turkish music flowers candles and mosaics design best for a romantic dinner or friends gathering their menu is large you should try best roasted meat soaked in vinegar and herbs  its called kebab  and accompanied with vegetables and bread leaf dont miss their wonderful dessert truly best in the world try rice pudding and baklava they also have a large set breakfast you can enjoy a full privacy under a sky of stars or morning sunshine on a tiny romantic open air balconies surrounded by flowers and closed by glassy doors they serve high quality drinks and our beloved turkish raki which you dont feel how softly makes you drunk  the staff is fast and smiling they have an old turkish cook which sometimes comes out the owner is often there and friendly to guests i took my visiting family to pasha and i would definitely recommend this restaurant to you , i have eaten in pasha many times during my stay in shanghai and i can easily say it is the best turkish restaurant i have been to outside of turkey as a turk i appreciate turkish food and here you can eat some of the best i strongly suggest you have a dinner or lunch or even a breakfast at pasha if you are traveling in shanghai you can ask the staff for help to choose what to eat as they are very friendly and since you are already in a turkish restaurant i suggest you have some rak<u+0131> to drink with the food for a real turkish experience, a cozy place for lunch good service and a nice menu a little bit expensive but the quality of the food is excellent, small and cozy restaurant with great turkish food staff was really friendly and helpful worth it to try, we came from turkey for visiting china luckily we find the address of this restaurant after searching in google i must confess that i was very surprised finding a turkish restaurant in china providing the same delicious taste like in turkey ambience was cozy with friendly and quick stuff i can definitely recommend the lamp chops and the mixed grill platter finding original turkish raki here made us very happy as well strong recommended place we will definitely come back thanks, we have visited pasha restaurant as a quite crowded family  group of friends almost everyone tried a different meal some of them ate fish some of them meat even duck i dont know how but chef managed to prepare all of these orders perfectly tasty and in a timely manner food was superb service was excellent i seriously recommend everyone to try pasha at least once then i guarantee youll become a regular, i have looking for nice turkish restaurant and some new friends told me about it i did not try the foodjust went there for sheesha and tea the sheesha was terrible  but the view was at the street and all chines were taking photos for the sheesha, we had something to celebrate and we booked at pasha that became paxia by the way
the hummus was mashed yellow peas for surebut no other ingredient no spices tasteless the bread provided was definitely not turkish either
the glass of raki was more a glass of water i called the waiter who tried to convince me it was theway it should be bad luck for him as i have a good record of raki in my life and he had to give up and bring me something that was getting a little bit closer to real raki
the lamacun  turkish meat pizza was acceptable i must say that after the tasteless hummus it wasnt too hard to give an impression of taste
then came the main with an iskender kebab grilled meat with bread and yogurt eatable but not the meat it should be
last mistake was to order a desert the sutlac a rice pudding that was the worst i ever had just awful couldnt finish it
the bill was not a light one and was increasing the huge disappointment for a dinner that was planned to be a nice and romantic one it was very short and we just wanted to leave and try to forget this bad food
paxia or pasha i make a promise i will keep for sureyou will never ever see us again neither or friends, since the famous restaurant on hengshan road closed and moved to underground floor of a shopping mall we were looking long for a turkish restaurant with soul 

pasha offers it with very good dishes an very typical but original decoration 

they managed to offer a pleasant environnement in a very small space 

if you are lucky or make a reservation you will be able to enjoy your meal on the two small balconies two seats each 

a restaurant that has to be on the to do list while in shanghai , pasha has a great turkish breakfast for a little bit under 200 rmb for 2 persons it is a varified and extensive meal with all kind of small mezze eggs cheese olives cucumber tomatoes nice atmoshpere inside i can certainly recommend this as a brunch spot for the weekend, this restaurant makes you feel used by choosing to eat there have you ever eaten chicken and rice that didnt taste like anything i have just been on a trip to shanghai i am a foreigner but i live in china i am more than used to turkish and oriental cuisine as half of my family comes from that region and i was so excited to try some food that reminded me of home
it was so unpleasant i paid 125 rmb  20$ for 5 cubes of chicken breast and some rice because they call it kebab it didnt even smell like kebab that s way too much and those who live in china and know the real taste too would know i have a point
i also had 4 spoons of hummus with some chinese bread for 65 rmb seriously
so to make the long story short
1 they take usual ingredients and they call them turkish names so they can charge 3 times the price they deserve chicken and ricewow
2the food doesnt taste like turkishmediterranean oriental food
3 the portion is made for kids
4the decor sucks the wall i had in front of me  i promise it is made of bathroom marble the tablecloths are white so it couldnt get more boring than that
i wouldnt mind the price if the quality would be at least half of what they pretend it is there were other people there when we had our lunch but they only ordered tea they knew better, seeking halal food i found this restaurant on the internet food is ok but very small portions and very expensive, we love our turkish food and despite enjoying the great chinese cuisine shanghai had to offer it was very nice to have a change for the week we were in china initially we could not get in due to a large group booking though they managed to fit us in on the balcony and they had my favourite beyti which did not disappoint in taste, very tasty and properly made turkish dishes presented and served as it should
i cannot tell you which part of turkey the cusine relates to but surely the dishes available are worth the trip and experience
the place can get rather busy so booking is recommended, after living some years in turkey this restaurant should be close for using turkey as a refrence

not good and too expensive, we were in a mood of good turkish food and to be honest we were disappointed after eating at this place i expected this place to be like the others i have tried in china  especially alibaba in guangzhou however i was disappointed as the humus was terrible the salad was awful the lentil soup was below average and the meats were just ok may be it was just a bad night at the restaurant however i will not take a chance again to try this restaurant, this was definitely one of my best western meals i have had in shanghai

we had a platter which had lamb chops chicken beef lamb all were delightful

a few other appetizers and sides which our host ordered sorry i dont rememember the names

this is a small cozy restaurant with great service great for business or romantic evening for two

because its so small reservations definitely recommended, the food was lower than average and the prices are too expensive to justify there are much better choices of excellent turkish food in shanghai dont even bother, zucchini pancakes were great but was really disappointed in the meat kebab dish for 2 to share the quality of the meat just wasnt quite right however when it was evident we didnt like it it was removed from the bill good service very cozy dining area  could have used more space for the big plates maybe another dish would have been a better choice, if you are seeking something a little different pashas is a pretty good stop the night i was there was bustling and fairly noisy but in a good way the staff seem to know what they are doing and the service is efficient if indifferent as typical of mainland china

the platters are generous and the food quality is high

well worth seeking out, simply best turkish food in shanghaigood atmosphere  good cook  friendly people best meat in shanghai seriously must try
aydin k, the chefs are turkish the owners are turkish the food is turkish and its a great little restaurant i eat there regularly and although the hummus is not going to win any prizes there are some great dishes on the menu

the setting is perfect with a small balcony overlooking nanchang lu its always full of foreigners and chinese alike which says a lot about the food and service, i am very hard to please but this place did just that great kabobs and breads cosy interior and great location i know i will be back

to improve a better selection of beers would be nice, one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai food is absolutely delicious it doesnt matter what you choose you wont be disappointed attentive service cozy ambiance and priced very reasonably  you truly feel like being transported to the exotic streets of istanbul its a small restaurant hence make sure to reserve ahead of time if you are a party of four or more, visited yesterday pasha restaurant with my bf
we came the first time and were really amazed about this small but very romantic place with nice music
the food was delicious and the rose wine is my favorite we eat some small appetizers and nice grilled dishes  fantastic
i can only recommend it pricevalue is really ok, it was perfect dinner with my friends at pasha restaurant last weekendthey have so many delicious foodgood service and nice winei will go again soon thanks to all pasha family, pasha is my favorite turkish restaurant in shanghai they have almost all kind of famous turkish kebabs i suggest you to try mix kebab or beyti chef is turkish and has huge experience of turkish food staffs are really friendly management of pasha just been changed a while ago now days they are upgrading their menu for more and more options

it is really good choice to have dinner in pasha with your friends solo couple or for business, nice atmosphere in this tiny but stylish turkish joint food was ok nothing impressive service was good but i am not sure i would repeat, we visited this restaurant after reading about it in ta  its very very small overpriced not authentic and the menu was very limited because of the small room they have you get the feeling that they are rushing you to finish and leave, after 10 months of being in shanghai this is the worst restaurant ive ever been to seriously the food was terrible and the prices were high i walked into the small but stylish second floor and i expected at least a decent meal and i was completely let down

i couldnt even call it turkish food the hummus was the absolute worse i make hummus all the time and its not a hard dish it was flavorless just cold lumps of mashed chickpeas  could not taste any garlic lemon or tahini it didnt even taste like chickpeas might as well have been a lump of cold tofu the dolmasi was decent but small in portion compared to the price our main dish was very uneventful ~ the chicken kebab just a few lumps of chicken one slice of grilled tomato and two slices of grilled pepper with a teacup size of rice boring even their presentation was ridiculous  there was no presentation the lahmacun a flat bread with minced meat was pitiful the smallest portion of paper thin bread with a thin layer ofwell goo it was more of a tomato paste with seasoning than a minced meat the only redeeming part of the meal was the homemade lemonade but 20 kuai for a teacup of lemonade was just not worth it

my husband has lived here for a long time and he also says its the worst meal hes had in shanghai this restaurant is a total joke this is the first time ive left a place and actually seen my husband upset over the quality of food he was served i cant believe anyone would like this place, really enjoyed this cozy little spot i particularly like the little one table terrace which overlooks a typically lovely french concession street the food was very good and i particularly enjoyed the starters will definitely return, its located in quiet local small street this restaurant is cozy and small its better to make reservation in advance the taste is below my expectation against previous remarks in tripadvisor maybe it becomes wellknown and good location so its little bit pricey 4 girls abt 100usd, you would almost walk passed it when walking on nanchang road but definitely worth it to go to the second floor for a nice dinner many nice starters to choose from but best is their mixed grill platter as a main , my husband and i really loved everything about pasha foodwe tried almost 14th of the menu ambiance great staff manager chef chef himself came up and asked how was the meal for twice we had to wait for a while and the manager apologizedwhich he did not have to because we showed up without a reservation several times we felt very special i am a picky eater and try to eat home for the most of the time this was just awesome i wish we had a restaurant in washington dc like pasha too real authentic turkish food even better than many restaurants in turkey
thanks again for that great experience if we ever go to shanghai again pasha will be one of our stops for sure
it definitely is a mustgo restaurant, must admit i found it odd to go out for turkish food in shanghai but tonight myself and two locals went there for an incredible meal the ambiance food and owner not sure if he was the owner but he was super nice and most helpful made this a meal to remember we left it in the owners hands to pick out all the foods and although we had a bit too much to eat who doesnt these days each dish was better than the next the walnut appetizer the lavosh something wrapped in vine leaves and then all the assorted kabobs were just amazing and the turkish wine made it 100 complete, it was a good meal we really enjoyed the cleanliness and great hospitality shish kebap and pide was great choices for us it is little dark inside but i bet it will be great during summer, my friends and i really enjoyed pasha it is a pretty small and nicely decorated turkish restaurant with wonderful food the ambience is nice and relaxing and the wait staff is quick and attentive especially with the wine pouring try their amazing humus and traditional bread as well as their kabobs will be returning again",NA,NA
338,"such an amazing place the food was amazing bit expensive though i think you have reserve to find a table staff was polite only the toilets was a bit dirty thumbs up for this place, the restaurants location is very nice the building  the ambience  decoration with all those nepali antique and all

the food was good  although a nepali myself i needed the staff help for ordering for 4 people still there was some waste
the taste is very authentic no doubt about that of course there are some fusion appetizers like the cheeseball that i would like to learn
it was bit difficult for us to choose the table 3rd floor without any people  2 nd floor with all shoes off concept and 1st floor already crowded we chose 2nd floor , quite good food
spicy enough
nice place nice environment
good service
will come back for sure with friends, not overly amazed by nepali kitchen got the thali and it was quite overpriced for what you get very similar to indian food i cant tell the difference really i didnt order the cheese balls but they are supposed to be great, american
very picky eater love flavor and spice
this place was great food was full of flavor and spice
spent 2 weeks shanghai this place was my favorite visited more than once the cheese balls are so good sounds silly compared to all the fancy foods i tend to love but hey delicious food is delicious food, when entering the nepali kitchen you are welcomed with mellow colors and dark wooded furniture providing the place with the relaxed and rather lowkey atmosphere reminiscent of similar outfits in kathmandu we went for the lunch special which is a great deal at 70 rmb including fresh naan bread a hot and a soft drink as well as a variety of veg and nonveg options the service was swift and easy going therefore strongly recommended if you stay or work in the area and look for a nice lunch hangout, unexpectedly great indian food and delightful staff we went twice and it was packed both times we are from the uk and are used to good indian food but this was up there with some of the best we did not expect to find anywhere this good in china highly recommend, im with three other colleagues this time the environment is warm and cozy i like the food very much like paratha mismas tarkari these are the vegetarian choices of course they offer meat dishes too lasso is always my choice of drink when im here for starters i always like samoa and cheese balls and im enjoying bananas pharma this time, this place has always been my favorite south asian restaurant since 2004 its long standing history is testimony to the quality and taste as well as ambience and service of the restaurant its the best nepali food in the city ive been going here for years even if its been out of my way on short vacations back in shanghai bringing friends and family to enjoy the joy of sharing a meal at this charming restaurant the experience itself is fun with the floor seating and cushions the beautiful interior and decor that makes you feel like youre in nepal the servers are from nepal and that also gives you a sense that youre actually there ive personally been to nepal and i feel that this restaurant embodies an authentic meal eaten at a nice restaurant there the curry and meat dishes are delicious as well as the rice and paratha selections the desserts and lassis are also yummy too i recommend this place a million times for an authentic experience you wont regret, this place has the cozy seating and a cool atmosphere the service is very attentive the only drawback is that a good amount of the food is fried otherwise the flavors are very good, after a trip to nepal where i happened to run into the owner i had to give this restaurant a try man were we happy we did the tandoori fish is a hero dish great flavor firm and moist everything we had was great from prawns to the seafood rice go go soon, one of my favourite restaurants in shanghai very nice for special occasion dinners super cool atmosphere the staff is very familiar and friendly and the food is yummy wont feel hungry for a while after eating there, as a visitor to shanghai its a nice to have the opportunity to eat authentic non chinese food in a relaxed small spaces restaurantbut the place is in fact 3 floors of dining rooms so it isnt that small its just well set out courteous english speaking staff and the main menu is in english too if you have a favourite nepalese restaurant at home you will be very happy eating here i wont blabber on about the menu and make something out of nothing with all the normal dishes thanks for a lovely meal, excellent food here and very good value i love nepalese cuisine and would eat here again for sure top stuff, we went to this restaurant over the weekend and it was brilliant the taste was so good and the choices of food really excellent i loved this place i highly recommend this restaurant if you like curry the service was really efficient and polite and the restaurant decor also very good give this a try if you are in shanghai",NA,NA
339,"service is friendly and reacting quickly jazzy music so good atmosphere good choice of bottled beer foot was ok  good mix of salad sandwich burger and chinese food, quite good place to go both for food and drinks good selection of beers had a burger which was ok so would say this is three stars but considering it is in china it is four better than most other places anyway, after a long day of work this is a nice place to go to nothing fancy nothing extremely special but good food and service one of the guys was very attentive holding the doors open and having a smile on his face the entire evening

my boyfriend had the japanese beef bowl which he liked i had the ramen bowl with pork belly there was an egg in this soup that was absolutely delicious, the restaurant offers very good food in a stylish environment the old french building combined with a sleek furnishing fit very well food as you can expect from the restaurants name is focused on pork the ribs were my clear highlight among the various bits that we shared, first time i went there with my cousin and we had lunch there the food and coffee were really just ok nothing special then i went there for a coffee with a friend because i liked there big celling again the coffee was just ok, the place is lowkey and the design is a great mix of subtle yet sophisticated i enjoyed the portraits of musicians and such displayed throughout the open area

the had the grumpy sandwich which came with fries and a free drink of selected soda or hot tea the portions were good and filling my friend had the tonkostu ramen with grumpy fries which was big and filling in portion size as well

the only thing was the waitress was a bit unattentive as we were the only group in the restaurant at the time had to call �fuwuyuan a couple times to get her attention but she was polite nonetheless i would recommend this place for a social gathering with friends to catch up and chit chat kid friendly as well, this place is funky not fancy very low key the food quality is fantastic though and it has earned a place on our list of places we go every time we are in shanghai which is 23 times per year
the cod bowl is fantastic, nice atmosphere located on a japanesewestern mixed barrestaurant street very loungy mood with the background jazz music and a menu that is really inviting me and a friend decided to go for one of the steamed buns each millionaire blt and the tare pork belly not too shabby but could have tasted more i took the pork dumplings train after that while my friend was craving for a burger i wasnt super excited with mine nor was my friend with the burger his comment previously working as a hamburger chef was that it was too much stuff on it and made it too large to make it edible also our brooklyn ipas drafts were lacking of carbon dioxide

now dont get me wrong i would like to give this place another try with some other food or have a go at the cocktails but for this evening the experience was soso, nice food good prices casualmellow hip environment with motown and interesting jazz background music good us draft beers too not real china at all but fusion food done well with atmosphere good for homesick westerners also ok area for latenight walk back to marriottcity center, i was going to give this place a 3 rating until

the crispy porkbelly bao arrived that  alone  gets five stars

the food is good and not your normal fare for shanghai the service is awful but then this is china so thats not unusual they have an excellent selection of beers wines and cocktails as well

the menu is tapasstyle and most of the items can be shared that lets you sample a wide range of dishes

as the name of the establishment suggests pork features prominently in most of their dishes but there is a little something for everyone even vegetarians

there is a cool expat funky vibe to the grumpy pig if the staff would put down their telephones and attend to their customers it could be a fun place to grab a meal, i was on a week long trip in shanghai and this place was a wonderful break from the traditional chinese shanghai fare i brought a group of friends with me and we had a great time the atmosphere is open and laid back with great music in the background the menu was diverse my friend loved the twist on an old american favorite with the blt bao dumplings were yummy

i even went back the last week i was in town for their movie night with some more friends watched an interesting documentary on a ny fashion icon iris apfel, the grumpy pig was a delightful experience the menu is innovative using mostly pork ingredients the ambiance is relaxed with comfortable quiet and interesting decor the knowledgeable wait staff offers great service you wont have to wait long for your food and drink to arrive they have a full service bar offering cocktails wine and draft beers located near the four seasons hotel, my son discover this jewel we enjoyed a great lunch the vibe is hip and decor has kind of a relaxed jazz club feel the main dining area is under a glass canopy so the daytime lightning is natural we were promptly greeted and seated and unlike most chinese establishments our drink order arrived quickly we ordered an appetizer and two lunch entrees the food quality was very good but it took forever for our food to arrive like most other chinese establishments the entrees came out staggered by at least 15 minutes my son was finished with his sandwich before my soup entree even arrived but the food was good, had dinner at the grumpy pig and loved it the decor was modern but with elements of the charm of old shanghai the street the restaurants located is maoming lu very close to four seasons where i was staying it seems to be an up and coming street with couple really good boutiques also bad ones and some good restaurants i also love the fact that they serve water up front unlike many chinese restaurant you have to purchase water and has very very clean and nice bath room

the food was also fantastic i especially liked the dark vinegar ribs we ordered two portions price was good midlevel pricing highly recommend the grumpy pig for simple fresh food and great atmosphere suitable for foreigners and locals alike, had a very tasty meal started off with the sharer of prawns and another sharer of ribs both were delicious main meal i had the pork belly ramon which was very tasty and very filling staff kept water glasses topped up and were very helpful
thoroughly recommend this place, only expats during our visit and i understand why people go there fantastic atmosphere amazingly tasty food friendly staff nice drinks� everything was really good would definitely go again nicely located in the french concession, theres a lot to like about the grumpy pig  very relaxed atmosphere great location and interesting mix with the adjacent store the other reviews are quite accurate we found their food was hit  miss the burger and fries were among the best weve had in shanghai but their recommended pork platter was just ok service was good enough but it wasnt too busy crowd was all westerners worth a visit especially if youre in the neighborhood and want to chillout with some drinks and snacks, great food and ambiance good selection of drinks and the bar tender knows what he is doing
the restaurant is located behind a store make sure you look for it, located centrally great food good service and excellent atmosphere must visit when in shanghai
it is located behind a store so look for it carefully, everything we had was delicious and flavourful

the pork nuggets spring rolls salads burgers crack pieall worth another trip

attached to a clothing shop the vibe in the restaurant continues the laid back feel and with the tunes finishing off a perfect date place

go and enjoy, had some spring rolls some greens and other deliciousness i cant find the perfect words to describe how unique their take is on traditional foods but it was great the restaurant is connected to a store front and has a cool 80s90s hip hop vibe the jams are on point and ambiance is chill loved the visit stay sexy shanghai, we walked in stood around waiting for someone to seat us but no one attended us so we just sat down on our own we were the first ones in the restaurant my buddy and i ordered blt and my wife ordered lettuce wraps after we ordered our drinks were served well done then we waited waited and waitedmy wifes food was served lettuce wraps were good and steam blt bun was good and she finished her dishes and still my friend and i havent seen our food 34 tables ordered several dishes and ate all their food had coffee and still no blt
absolutely poor service the worst part is the servers didnt communicate to us at all to whats happening anyways our blt finally came after 40 minutes and it was good the bacon was pretty crispy and a good amount of it but it was hard to truly enjoy since i was upset about whole service
i will come back again and give them another chance since the food was good but i hope they can offer some training to their staff to improve the service, this is a most unique place i have ever seen in shanghai a cool boutique store at the front pass through the store you will reach to the restaurant there nice 60 70s soul and funk album covers on the wall which is perfectly match the music they were playing very chill and warm deco with a very unique menu which is combined chinese japanese western and vietnamese food you can taste everything they use is very fresh well cooked you must try the pork neck steak and tonkatsu love this place and mos def will go back again and again, the concept here is a bit unique

walk through a hip hop  fashion store into a back courtyard and small dining room where a great time awaits

grumpy pig is all about the pork all about great drinks and all about being laid back from pulled pork sandwiches to pork ramen to several other well prepared treats everything is full of creativity and care feels like the coolest guy you know who happens to be a chef cooked it for you rather than in a restaurant

super casual environment reasonable prices in a quiet environment that usually has good music dont worry theyre not playing anything loud and its usually mixed up this place is good fun and cant recommend it enough

protip go around 6pm on a weekday when youll have the place mostly to yourself drinks will come quickly and you can impress your date with just what a gem the pig is, ive been to the grumpy pig for breakfast and drinks and love the atmosphere of this courtyard cafe bar brunch is great with a really creative well executed menu a few veggie options on the menu and they are happy to accommodate good spot for a quiet drink in the evening too

great music with soul funk and hip hop playing throughout the day and night and an added bonus is that the courtyard is smoke free very rare in shanghai

the cafe bar is connected to a mens streetwear shop at the front called kin great little shop as well

well be back for the cafe and the menswear store next time were in shanghai",NA,NA
34,"muse group + grey goose vodka = a winning recipe i usually go for predrinks before spending the night out on the bund as it is a close walk to m1nt and bar rouge they have great cocktails and finger food get that calamari you wont regret ityou will most likely find it filled with trendy expats and rich locals it was the hot spot of summer 16 and for a good reason

i also had dinner there however i was not impressed it was ca va and overpriced for what we received

overall i would give 5 stars for the bar and 3 stars for the food  service at dinner, second time i have been there very nice and trendy urban design with scandinavian influences lots of natural elements seating in 3 different zones high tables sofas and comfortable low soft seats we got offered a greygoose cocktail as welcome drink nice plates to share good quality of food and well balanced diversity the scallops were fantastic normally i dont like scallops actually all dishes were good a little loud is the only negative element but it adds to the urban feeling will be back, been there couple times they have pretty nice comments about their cocktails which i agree on that as well what i like better is their oyster always fresh and juicy worth for a visit, in town to meet some business friends and we decided to visit the bar was designed to be awe inspiring very accessible and inviting the bartenders all made great drinks the writer had more than one

casual seating created an element of coziness perfect for our rendezvous the menu choices were perfect for sampling variety excellent menu variety great quality of food very well plated|presented and the staff has highly trained to be professional attentive responsive and highly engaging what a treat be share the moment with friends the outside deck was a great place to cool off and engage in some quiet conversation this place is a must visit, this is a 5 star place from service to food to decor got the whole sea bass and it came out in a fishshaped flour crust that was huge portion great value for food but cocktails can be better not creative enough and tasted blend, another one of those places in vogue to see and be seen come and take a photo with that beautiful centrepiece at the bar island and you are probably done

i have been here twice during my time in shanghai first time for drinks and second for drinks with light bites never the easiest place to get a seat at the bar but we waited it out and scored

love the music here which just gets pumped up as the night gets later and more fabulous people of shanghai flood in not a club for sure the place is still set up for groups of friends to lounge the night away

fabulous drinks so so food and not the best place for bespoke thought maybe because carson himself isnt behind the bar, impressive new location which was recommended by the hotel as current place to be special great food and perfect service, scandinavian style decoration and food fantastic food and drinks quality amazing atmosphere nice music
after 1000 transforms into a club, absolutely impeccable very good service fantastic meal amazing cocktails great music this place is particularly special a real gem, came in for a drink but staid for dinner at the bar which was great nice atmosphere we ordered meat which was delicious ill go back to take the pan fried foie gras looked great in my neighbors plate, group of friends to share bonesless pigeons stuffed in boneless duck at 888rmb sides arrived after 30min  brought back to reheat at 40min duck served at 70min duck and pigeons full bird  full off bonesforgotten sides served at 90min

complained offered to pay about 2k out of 3k total subtracting bird dilemma and forgotten sides told sides would be subtracted but birds i should pay or foreign manager btw the police would be called after 2nd sentence of discussion

decided to call police myself explained situation got outcome of what i had proposed initially 

i ask myself why not offer a round of drinks or some customer service would have probably solved the mistakes instead aggressiveness was the case


answer c class service staff no sign of what prices implied, this past friday night six of us enjoyed a protracted dinner at nest in shanghai the restaurant crowd ranged from multigenerational families with newborns to the most sophisticated shanghai residents the seafood was delicious the setting relaxed and very nicely done the staff very attentive and helpful this is an expensive restaurant but not out of line with other top shanghai bund area establishments we will definitely return, ive gone here a few times and enjoyed the vibe its an eclectic crowd a variety of people in varying degrees of fancy dress

the atmosphere is laid back lounge and the service was great

we came here after a formal event to continue with drinks and had a really good time, great atmosphere and good service food is very differently presented and gooda must place to visit when in shanghai, excellent chilled out bar at least in the evening before the party starts very good martinis and cocktails of all descriptions but grey goose vodka is the star here really due to their partnership with the bar the food is focused on seafood and is of a high quality this is a fantastic upmarket place which would be great for a date or just to go for some drinks of an evening i must confess to not enjoying the bar at weekends after a certain time when the lights go off the loud music comes on and the pretentious designerlabel wearing expat and chinese people come waltzing into the bar in an aloof fashion but each to their own, good foods
good grey gooses cocktails
good view

very good location and easy to access, we have been in a lot of resto in shanghai 10y monthly visitor so we know the city really well this is a good place proce quality is more than fine we recommand it gor dinner or nice coctail in the evening  but reserve a table of you want to have dinner  the place is packed, good food also nice cocktails they not have dj but anyway greate atmosphere there like this place so much will be back, incredible atmosphere creative drinks and good food theres a nice vibe and the staff is very friendly, heard this was good and went twice on last trip to shanghai upstairs in a nondescript building by the penisula just off the bund scandi meets canadian chic great seafood  music that was cool and just load enough to have an atmosphere but not to loud to talk, it was a nice change from the chineseasian food i had for the last week amazing cocktails spicy and great nordic food the blinis with salmon and roe were great as well as the tuna tartare and the fish  chips<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc> pretty pricey though, very nice place especially the bar it is a allinone place you start with a drink then have dinner and can stay there until the middle of the night quite expensive , great brunch menu that is definitely price worthy love the rustic chic space that is good to chill at with friends delicious food and lovely presentation the oysters are one of my fav, the nest combines excellent food drinks and a great atmosphere the music not too loud one of the best places i hung out at in shanghai i highly recommend it, excellent choice of dishes to be shared with incredible calamari and very good oysters it is a very good party bar  restaurant  fun club like party place go and have some fun , a very good restaurant to try in shanghai surprising quality western food the steak fish and chip ham and cheese platter seafood platterlava cake are good recommendation to try, group of friends decided to go for dinner and here we are

environment great cozy great looking people bustling upbeat smoking area totally mixed up i have a hard time breathing

food great stuff we had the grilled ribs wagyu the sea bass that comes in a crust and some salad quality of food was good

service waiters was helpful but not very detail oriented i wanted to know what kind of vegetables are included in one of the dishes and he could not tell me instead he just said red dry leaves just to stop me from asking further bad stuff

cost not cheap and for service like that really have to ask yourself twice

if you have not gone there before try it out i would not go back the second time, my partner and i were there couple weeks ago in october it was recommended by one of my friend who live in shanghai we really liked the atmosphere food was just amazing try oysters and tuna carpacio huge choice of cocktails and drinks, went here with some buddies we were really looking for a nice bar nice cocktails and good snacks this place is nicely laid out very chinese so not many foreigners the food and service was great they have a very large selection cocktails were top notch lots of different styles and tastes to be had they did have a party at 8 so we were kicked at that time would go back it was a real treat, we have been visiting the nest during our trip to shanghai in august and was impressed but this venue the ambience and the atmosphere was great the bar have a wonderful terrace from where you can have a great view of the bund and skyline we ordered the seafood linguine which was made perfectly and taste delicious as well as we try on of the signature cocktails based on the grey goose vodka and fresh berries juice there was a fashionable deep house music playing as a background and it is a great place for a romantic evening or a place to meet with you friends before exploring the nightlife of shanghai, my wife and i experienced the nest for dinner and not as a club so the review will focus on the dining angle while the restaurant was full of the stylish denizens of the bund the venue came across less pretentious then other bund options prices were reasonable and dishes and drinks were inventive eyecatching and delicious after the welcome drinks my wife had a grapefruit  wasabi celery cocktailwhich was surprisingly goodbut the star was their award winning cocktail made with rum and black truffle honey we then tried options from their raw seafood selections but the beef tartar served on top of a flaming bone filled with marrow was the stole the show i recommend this place for an after work date where you can take your time slowly ordering and nibbling through the menu over a few drinks, outstanding place and service came across the best host ever arthur who makes every small and big effort to make it a memorable experience food drinks and service are all best in class, one of my favourite place in town the food is amazing the venue is friendly and you can keep drinking after dinner and partying great concept, this bar is full of foreigner good music and ambiance but attendant are not so friendly try to come early since table are limited and mostly occupied they have tables outside but not available for no reason wine selection are limited also not a good experienced for us, nice bar restaurant with very nice ambience and very good cocktails i tried also some food in the bar which was also very good very good impression for the bartender he was very professional for sure i will go back, food is really good  practically everything on the menu is perfect ive been here for dinner and post dinner cocktails are good  possibly real alcohol and not fake music is weird though it could use work, a great find  eventually keep your eyes open as not that obvious we were very lucky to have the st germaine roving ambassador working behind the bar when we visited lovely cocktails local barmen pretty good as well lovely contemporary bar we didnt eat here but the smells coming out of the kitchen were lovely a trifle expensive but worth a visit, set out on the terrace usual air conditioning chill inside and enjoyed a monty python cocktail
three of us shared steak platters fish and the amazing profiteroles
views are ok not spectacular
service was fine though limited english so if you have any questions difficult to get a answer, cool ambience under the direction of french chef freddy raoult the food is surprisingly very good for a restaurant which is also a bar and a night club waitresses tend to be aggressive and push you to order unreasonable quantities of food so just be firm if you care about health but many customers dont seem to because the nest is one of the few upscale restaurants in shanghai where you can still smoke indoors including cigars and kreteks as people at a table nearby did this place is sponsored by grey goose and serves all kinds of creative cocktails using gg vodka or bombay sapphire gin also under bacardi the owner of gg, pretty disappointed with the nest as someone who was a long time customer ran into some pretty terrible service last night arrived and sat on the balcony for 15 minutes without anyone coming understandable they were busy but when a waitress did come out we finally called her over and asked her to bring us a menu so we could order some drinks another 10 minutes pass we then see the waitress flirting with customers chatting with them getting kissed on the check by the customers and just looking like she is having a great time for several minutes we call out to her several times which is the norm in china and she looks at us and completely ignores us while serving this other table

at that point we got angry and went inside from the balcony to speak to the manager called the manager over and asked to speak him he immediately spoke in an aggressive manner and acted like we had done something wrong by expecting the waitress to give us a menu had to spend another 10 minutes arguing before he finally admitted that maybe they messed up but continued to give dirty looks to our table and just be completely unenthusiastic about the service

hate that it has come to this but do not think i can provide them with my business anymore after that experience, this is probably a good place to start your night out in shanghai great location near the rock bund with terraces offering a spectacular view on this vibrant city mixed international and local crowd less snobbish than br tends to get loud and crowded at around midnight, this bar is a great place to go any time for a delicious meal and cocktail more of a bar focused its pumping on friday and saturday nights with both expats and local shanghainesse the menu offers western classics executed with modern approach it is simple yet delicious, amazing view on the lively district of the bund the river and the skyscrapers of pudong international people amazing atmosphere great drinks and food and fantastic interiors, better than many of shanghais best the venue is alluring modern and is electric with energy and atmosphere without a reservation youre likely to be left standing at the entrance but i was lucky to have gotten a spot at the oyster bar no where in the world including seaside mediterranean restaurants or parisian oysters bars have i had such fantastic oysters they were so succulent and flavorful i actually ended up chewing them i dont know where the nest orders their oysters from but im assuming it must be a best kept secret the presentation was also exciting and picturesque as for the service it sadly was no where near exceptional let alone even standard the wait staff had no command of english which made ordering even a glass of water a 15 minute ordeal they also seemingly appeared to be deliberately inattentive the one waiter who did speak english was painfully arrogant and actually was busy taking shots behind the oyster bar and serving free shots to female patrons instead of paying attention to waiting paying customers nonetheless the nest remains a favorite shanghai hangout and i highly recommend it aside from the service it will not disappoint, what can one say food is outstanding and they only really serve until 2200 then it turns into an upscale club and bar anybody who is anybody will eventually end up here during the evening the only thing that might turn someone off is the seating during dinner you are eating while on a couch and off a coffee table the food i cannot describe excellent, food was great oysters fresh like the marinated salmon with the vodka blinis egg in cocote was great and halibut is so fresh will be back again, i have been to this restaurant several time and always had a good time the restaurant turns into a club after 10pm but you can still order the delicious food even very late they have deals on oysters sometimes definitely a great dining and partying place, it was recommended by our friend it is absolutely the best that we needed to come back on our last night in shanghai during our short holiday in the city, the place has a great decoration above the bar and drinks are one of the best ive tried in shanghai food is delicious and oyster deal is definitely the one to go for","Taiwanese cuisine",0.999750808079822
340,"lovely setting for a drink or dinner not a bad view to be found super curtiouse staff with an extensive bottle list, while on a stopover in shanghai we discovered by chance this amazing place with a beautiful view on the bund from the restaurant or on the topfloor bar this place owns his title of michelin star restaurant from the service very attentive without being overwhelming the food that offers french cuisine with an asian twist and the wine list which spoils you with an impressive choice of wines from either the old or the new continent some details amusebouches as starters explanation provided in the dishes  show that this place really cared for their customers in order to provide them a real and unforgettable michelin start restaurant experience restaurant, we enjoyed our dinner the also have a own caviar menu the service and the menu was excellent the winelist was okay but for white wines we expected a bit more nice views from there and if you can visit the terrace bar it was closed because of bad weather when we where there, one of our shanghai trip highlights the service is amazing the food is fantastic and the drinks hit the spot my husband even found his favorite cigar romeo y julieta which he enjoying watching sunset over pudong absolute perfection, this is probably a best kept secret of shanghai because it has the best view of the bund definitely go to the roof top bar for an amazing view of the city skylines

the restaurant serves modern french cuisine and have a la carte options or fourfive course meals the setting is very romantic with lots of large flower bouquets around the hotel and restaurant dinner for two will be around at least $300+ and will give you one of the better dining experiences in shanghai the service is up to par for michelin star restaurants the bread courses throughout dinner was fantastic, the restaurant is on the upper floor of the peninsula hotel overlooking the bund the ambience is elegant and quite we ordered different menus ranging from fish to meat i enjoyed the stuffed king frog legs great all the food was served in perfect timing and nicely decorated taste was excellent we enjoyed very much service impeccable, had family dinner over four course also red wine and ice cream rare thing to see such good service in shanghai and they enjoy their work with pride which is very good hotel excellent location on the bund and watching over window while eating and drinking good taste, lovely bar on roof of the hotel the peninsula great service
a great place for a romantic dinner with wine and light snacks",NA,NA
341,"sometimes during the business meetings local people like to invite useuropean for eat some mediterranean dishes in asia well restaurant is full of young people great service which speaks very good english restaurant serves topical spanish dishes whit some local variation very good quality fresh food but its still not real spanish restaurant who serves tapas overall very good if you wants european food good wine and atmosphere i believe is nice choice for local people and travelers missing their home, i went there for a casual dinner with a friend and wasnt disappointed we had a nice meal great to share the tapas good and affordable wine and great service in an atmospheric setting just after we arrived at around 630pm the restaurant filled up quickly and all the tables around us were full, nice place for lunch or dinner always full so plan to arrive before 7pm alfresco dining or eat inside, dropped in here for an early dinner on a sunday not that many people around the dishes were good quality and came out decently quickly

the house wine spanish of course was passable

attached some photos the beef and the fried anchovies were standouts, has now been living 5 years in shanghai when we moved here we often came to this restaurant we decided do come back and enjoy some good food unfortunately it was a disappointment the standard is not the same anymore portions are smaller and dont taste as before, nice place in the foreigner pedestrian street in hongmei road good tapas as well as drinks nice service they have some tables outside where you can dine if it is not too hot, we tried many food dishes both veg and nonveg and all were excellent and perfect in taste
the restaurant serves best cocktails loved the food , we tried a few dishes like the garlic prawn garlic bread fried foie gras toast mostly very delicious except the suckling pig is average we like the sangria too price not cheap but worth the money as the food is pretty authentic spanish style and tasty we went late after lunch hour and found they offer good deal of lunch set at rmb88  half priced paella so for those who keen for good deal do check it out before 2pm in weekdays service is good too, not cheap but worth the money improves every time and service is nice come back surely have always eaten only tapas as they are well prepared, one of my favorite restaurant in shanghai
at least must be visited once a month
perfect service with one of the best spanish chef in shanghai
just check the photos, was here with a friend and were trying to get some western food before a week of of traveling the country side tapa were pretty authentic and beer was good sat outside and enjoyed one of the last nice evenings in the year, this place has another location at he kerry centre but i like this location on laowaojie road  i think i spelled that right where all the expats go to eat western food great place for tapas, my spanish friends always tell me las tapas has got it wrong  tapas bars are all about small cheap portions where you order a lot to fill you up las tapas they say gets it wrong by offering largerthannormal portions at higher prices so you buy less

whatever the spanish point of view may be my feeling has always been that las tapas gets it mostly right  especially for the weekday lunch special for 88rmb you get to tapas is that the noun salad bar and coffee or tea its an excellent valueformoney deal that fills you up with quality food

outside of the deal it does seem to offer slightly less value but it depends what you order  i ama huge fan of the lamb and the chorizo dishes which are more expensive i would say this place is certainly worth a visit on a weekday lunch time for the 88rmb deal, fantastic tapas good wines and beers in this small place along the laowai jie the pedestrian street in hongmei rd good and kind service, i really like this restaurant but even more since they have a great spanish chef
pintxos are really good, foreign food is more and more en vogue in shanghai so do not expect only foreigners eating here some of the tapas are not as fine as i expected and experienced in this restaurant before  but i was in san sebastian for some days this year and compare with my experience there maybe a bit unfair
but i got a very delicious seafood paella which was compensating very nicely
still a good place for expats to go as well as the whole hong mei pedestrian street, great lunch with friends the food was delicious our server was excellent and took care of all of our needs the restaurant was very clean well definitely return in the future, this place is located in the middle of hongmei lu pedestrian street aka as laowaijie foreigners street so you can expect many foreigners here among the 50 chinese
las tapas is at the higher end of the pricing but also for me at higher end of the value i really enjoy being here eat the tapas or the paella and having a nice sangria
for me the most relaxing place in the laowaijie and i recommend it for the couples having sth to celebrate but not wanting to spend a fortune in some bund restaurants
its not fancy but if you sit outside you can really imagine the spanish athmosphere and have the mediterreanean food, las tapas is one of the favorite restaruants of me and my wife in shanghai we go there very frequent and we go to various of their outlets hongmei lu sinan manison red town we also had already several parties with larger groups there the food there is very nice and tasty and the service is excellent most important in shanghai the good food quality is very stable in a place like shanghai where many restaurants have very unstable food quality and taste this is a very important fact the wine selection is very good too and there is always a wine available fitting your food i have been already in their very first restaurant at maoming lu just after they opened it speaks for itself that i am a very loyal guest since almost one decade now, i have come here for the past five years and the food is solid comfort in the cold wet shanghai winter las tapas has a good wine and comforting tapas a most try when visiting shanghai, surprising find in shanghai pudong went a number of times
very expensive compare to anywhere in the world
squid ink pasta is very tasty, we had an enjoyable dinner at las tapas in the laowei street in hongmei lu nice atmosphere excellent food and good sangria we started of with some tapas like marinated sardines pan fried mushrooms in garlic and patatas bravas followed by the traditional paella valenciana tapas were very good a little bit tasteless but we used salt and pepper to get them very tastful paella was a little bit soft but very tastful i like the paella more crunchy and well done overall a very good meal and very good service we come again, tried it once and experience tapas meal in shanghai environment is good food is all right something different if you want to try different kind of meal price is okay for american standard, i had dinner with a friend at this restaurant on a weekday evening the restaurant has a decent outdoor sitting area and is suitable for small and large groups the menu is varied and offers many traditional dishes we had dishes with octupus tripe and chorizo all were very tasty and quantity was modest the service was very nice and attentive a good bottle of wine finished off a very good meal most highly recommended for a relaxed light dinner or lunch, just finishing lunch here the tapas menu is extensive we had olives pepper salmon brochettes egg plant all was good we sat upstairs a bit noisy outdoors on ground floor is an option definitely a good variety to the diverse shanghai food scene, i decided to make a random dash to las tapas it is a beautiful place with a great outplace

the good the food is good and the environment and people it feels good bad wifi

the bad very limited menu for food it took me 30 minutes to decide on a meal and the meal looks different from the pictures you may need to combine menus to get a full meal the waitresses are helpful

enjoy shanghai, no surprised from this restaurant many tapas you can choose but seems no main course at all after tapas you can only order paella and pasta nothing else wine list is also limited waiters are okay not very attentive price is also okay not expensive, went there with my friend last night in jinqiao
it is great that you could find a free parking lot in shanghai and you also can tasted wonderful food
but we did not finish all thing we ordered because we are only two person there it will be great if they could study their menu for 2 person only, went with a bunch of colleagues to las tapas in hong mei lu lao wai jie the food was ok and staff are very friendly great place to sit out and eat when it is not raining  and it rained when we went and sat out , we were two and took few tapas the dishes arrived quite fast and were good the service at the other hand was very bad rude not willing ti help, while in shanghai we thought of trying out some spanish food we zeroed in on las tapas as it had the best reviews and closer to home we were offered a good table and the overall decor of the hotel was good we ordered some tapas garlic breadwhich was awesome and some seafood everything tasted nice however we were disappointed with the limited menu we hardly had choices in the maincourse, ok food and a nice ambience not extraordinary but value for money like the various small appetizers good with a glass of wie, we had some tapas and a jug of sangria the garlic bread was very nice the cheese sticks were good and nothing too fancy the sangria was also very good with lots of fresh cut fruits, not authentic spanish taste
im spanish btw
price too expensive for the quality
service was ok as we where almost the only persons in the place
ordered spanish omelette croquetas wine salad and a few more dishes one with chorizo and the other with mushroom
the menu is excellent but portions where too small for the price and it just didnt taste as back home, this is not spanish food at all please do not i repeat do not take this for spanish food im offended this people are serving this stuff and pass it for spanish our food has nothing to do with what this people claim is spanish cuisine please awful food awful service highly priced for the less than mediocre food they serve, the spanish style of eating tapas suits chinese habits quite well not the big individual plates that are served in many other western restaurants but smaller ones so that one can order a larger variety even for a small group and share
this place has been going since quite some time and seems to be doing well located in the foreigners street of gubei an area densely packed with all kinds of cuisine except the upmarket kind when it is not too hot or too cold or too wet one can sit outside though not with much space
this time i went alone for a sunday lunch had the tenderloin in a brandy sauce which was still very good while another recent reviewer here was less lucky it seems and the egg plant with minced pork and cheese which was a little unbalanced much eggplant very little pork too cold to sit outside but though i went relatively late for local standards it was reasonably crowded nothing worse than eating in an empty restaurant, we were invited to a birthday party here food was pretty goodservice good and good atmosphere nothing fancy but a very enjoyable visit, just went today and it was not up to any standards the beef tenderloin in blue cheese tapas which used to be my favorite went from being a delicious tender sauteed piece of beef to a cheap boiled fought and even uneatable bite which we had to leave in the plate the tortilla de patata was dry hard and tasteless the scallops with cheese were clearly frozen versions with a strange flavor really not much positive to say except that the croquetas were as good as i remembered one thing at last that was up to the memory but again they are hard to mess up we told the manager and he thought given us two coffees at the end of the meal that we barely touched was a good enough gesture to make us forget the food we left on the table very disappointing will not go back and will recommend my friends to avoid its on the downward slope, a spanish style tapas restaurant with quite big tapas so dont order too many our food was both great and disappointing the goatcheese and bruschetta was hits while the gambas and tortillas where a bit disappointing, it is good to go with friends if you want to try some thing diferents food is ok and many tapas to choose but for me it will not be a regular place to go, went there with an enjoy shanghai coupon for a free jug of sangriathey meant a free cup the jug was enough to fill two glasses and that was it the food was nothing specialprobably wont return, the food is well prepared try the lamb chops  amazing nice selection of elegant food, maybe ive been spoiled in san francisco but the tapas were just so so, service excellent nice live band what more can i say, if your looking for a change of food from the normal american cuisine or chinese than tapas is where you go, supposed to be a famous spanish restaurant it is one however not really value for money too hyped service was very slow food is ok nothing fantastic serves some house specialties but not really recommended, went there with a group and enjoyed a fantastic lunch set menu for rmb 79 everything tasted very good and i will definitely come back to try out some more of the delicious tapas especially liked the starter salad with balsamico dressing and goat cheese  my mouth is watering again so i better stop writing this review  if you like tapas good atmosphere go there, located in a long meandering alleyway i only found these places because i has seen some nicely dressed ladies leave the pearl market across the road and followed them much to my surprise i found this and many more cafes and bars, i had croquetas de jamon and papas bravas as starter and seafood paella as main very nice  nonenglish speaking service but very kind staff, very good food and service at a reasonable price  what more could you want",NA,NA
342,"one of the places in old style for sichuan spicy hot food in shanghai this is a place more for local people and people coming from sichuan not for foreign tourists since it is off the tourist roads in shanghai but the food is quite original and absolutely delicious",NA,NA
343,"the jasmine lounge is located on the first floor of the fairmont peace hotel in shanghai we had a great breakfast here during our stay they have extensive offerings both western and chinese including cooked to order eggs and excellent coffee the restaurant is buffet style for breakfast, the restaurant is located on the ground floor of the hotel the breakfast is presented as buffet with a high diversity of eastern and western choices they offer live cooking for eggs and omletts or eastern noodles

the variety of dishes and the quality of the food are amazing it is safe to say that this was one of the best breakfasts i have ever had

service was very nice and efficient offering fresh coffee and juices

the lounge also offers a an afternoon tea starting from 2pm, even by 5 star hotel standards the breakfast here is superb the staff coped well with the large number of guests and the historical surroundings of this lovely art deco lounge made for a relaxing breakfast experience there was a huge selection of local delicacies including noodles wontons and the best dumplings i tasted in shanghai

the western section was equally good with the hot items freshly prepared and of high quality the only minor criticism would be that we found the bacon rather tasteless eggs benedict were prepared to order and were perfect

there are a large range of juices including some interesting combinations and some healthy vegetable juice mixes freshly squeezed and presented in glass bottles this was a great idea

the range was so huge that it really set us up for the day avoiding the need to take much for lunch congratulations and thanks to all the hard working chefs and serving staff highly recommended, the was the final stop for our group and we had breakfast there which wasnt bad and our final supper what a letdown
the restaurant decided our menu which was herb broasted chicken if it was chicken it was very small and cooked too long so it was very dry for vegetables the was one 3 inch sliver of carrot and l stalk of something resembling asparagus and about a teaspoon full of mashed potatoes we did get a salad with house dressing over some aromatic cheese of some kind this was followed with cheese cake which consisted was 2 tablespoons of pure bland this meal should have been an embarrassment to those that served it but the service was at best mediocre at best, staff are very professional and very kind especiallyvicky she is the best i really enjoyed the excellent services provided by the all of the staff, this summer my family revisited shanghai city in china again and of course we selected fairmont peace hotel as a favorite place to stay
this year we noticed that the jasmine lounge was rearranged the layout and we like it so much the breakfast and service of the jasmine lounge is world class especially with vicky her service is top notch
jeffrey, one of the better hotel breakfasts ive had the pleasure of enjoying great selection everything from traditional fare to western bacon and eggs take your pick, the jasmine lounge is within the fairmont peace hotel and is used for the breakfast buffet even if you dont stay in the hotel you can experience a great afternoon tea here cost was under rmb700 for two but was worth it the savoury sandwiches were fresh and a good variety the tea selection was definitely better than average the scones were baked to perfection strawberry jam was the best we had in a long time the sweets were very well presented with lots of unique tastes the silverware was real and china was excellent quality the usual three tier silver tray was replaced by a vertical circular silver shape of a chinese symbol service was prompt and careful the classical pianist was a great finishing touch no need to book a table but go early because it does fill up, the afternoon tea set is fabulous but the price is a little bit pricey however with the good portion of the food it is highly recommended to share the tea snacks among 23 persons it also performed the chinese traditional instrument in the afternoon which is worth a while to enjoy, while staying at the peace hotel as guest i booked afternoon tea at the jasmine lounge much to my surprise quality of food is remarkably good there is a wide variety of canape and dessert scones are especially impressive which could rival those at a traditional english tea house

ambience at the restaurant is also pleasant bravo, we have never eaten a meal here but often take afternoon tea the desserts are fabulous and the ambiance is lovely dress smartly and be sure to make a reservation",NA,NA
344,"one of my personal favourites and a great restaurant overall

food prices are extremely low but the quality is very fresh wait times can be considerably long as its always packed recommend going in large groups so you can have a variety of dishes

bring a friend that can read chinese as they dont offer an english menu nor a picture menu, visited my wife as we fancied some casual food close to our hotel waldorf astoria we were greeted and shown to our table menu choice is vast service was a bit slow we ordered the pork belly sweet and sour pork chicken wings garlic spinach and two fried rice food was fantastic especially the sweet and sour pork and the egg fried rice portions are very big and we ordered too much bill was 260rmb we would definitely return, the quality of food was excellent and so was the overall ambience i particularly loved their chicken dish had a name i couldnt spell but on recommendation of the wait staff i tried it would do recommend the prices were slightly on the higher side but thats passable, chain of restaurants that preserves the chinese culinary traditions the home specialties are different kinds of soup
recommended , incredibly good and cheap the menu has a lot of choiceswe ate a lot and we spend only 40kuai per personhigly recomended, hard to describe the low quality of this restaurant in such a small box the service was slow to nonexistent during dinner hours the waitresses were rude and seemed too busy to help or just didnt want to vegetarian dishes were ordered that came with meat the food we could eat was bland and boring all things considered by far the worst service ive had in all of asia dont waste your time or money here, the first time we visited this restaurant was 10 years ago and we had their signature chicken soup on our recent visit last week we also had the soup and it has been consistently good and healthy throughout all the visits

other dishes you should try include steamed fish poached chicken and dim sum options like fried turnip cakes some of the vegetable options might be a little bland but we usually go either kailan with garlic or stewed eggplant though the latter may not be available all the time

service is usually friendly but hectic with waitstaff barrelling along the narrow corridors especially towards the back where the toilets are so do watch your step

this restaurant is located at one of the hua hai lu exits on the aboveground pedestrian walkway that bisects hua hai zhong lu and chongqing zhong lu near the northsouth expressway the nearest metro station is at south huangpi lu reservations are highly recommended in fact we usually make a reservation at least 3 days in advance even so you might have to wait a while for a table to free up

apparently they have opened a few other outlets including one near jingan temple, we were put on a table with 2 other groups of people after waiting for ages we would have hoped for our own table food however was good as always at grandmas kitchen, i went there with my cousin and his chinese wife so they order the food and was a great experience good food
like always in china they order much more food then we need what is nice to try a bit of all
the lemonade is nice and cool bottle glass
i have the impression they are like a restaurant chain or something like that because just come back from xiamen and they opened a grandmas home there different name and most beautiful decoration beautiful walls of rustic steel and dried lotus flower concrete walls have details painted in black wood ceramic pots withe and blue tiles fantastic worth the visit if you are in xiamenfujian, if you wanna try casual shanghainese food this would be your best bet nevermind the long queue just get a number and walk around abit this was the last meal of my trip and i wish we had more my favorite were the shrimp in garlic and the fish tofu dish dont know the names of the dishes but i took pictures for reference must try, a must visit restaurant for simple and authentic chinese food the place is very well set vast and expansive the choices will leave you totally confused to pick from every dish will make you taste an another one its rich tasty andsumptuous pls take help of service staff you are blessed if you find an english speaking one to understand the dish to enjoy it better dont end up eating a pickle very cost effective the ambience is well set you can feel crowded or cramped if the table is not rightly selected, very popular restaurant among chinese but the foods are really very rural and ancient if not used for do not try the stinky tofu if you are collector of strong impressions this restaurant could be a place to visit but maybe not to eat
inside it is crowded during evenings and you can find lot of local hipsters eating there but again be really careful when making an order, grandmas kitchen is delightful if you go in a large group you can easily spend less than 50 rmb pp i went with a group of 7 and we had a great variety of food if you like hearty tasty food served quickly with photos to help you decide then this is a great restaurant to go to i recommend the green tea rice cakes garlic prawns and the spicy fish huge bowl if you can handle it, food easy to order as there are photos on the menu staff efficient but not friendly large dining area plenty of room very busy all the food was just fine but nothing special we realized by the end of the meal that we were in a bland chain restaurant if youre looking for plenty of food served quickly at a reasonable price you will enjoy grandmas just dont expect to be wowed, three of us went together and found ample quantities of delicious food the menu included some english plus photos so was very usable for nonchinese speaking persons service was great, the price is good but the food is nothing more than average maybe we ordered poorly minimal flavor on any dish the service was good, its located on an expensive street so you would expect it to be expensive but its not at all its a clean restaurant with alright food not the best chinese but edible the prices explain how populat it is, greattasting dishes reasonably priced service is above adequate what else do you want from a 150rmb meal in shanghai, the concept of the restaurant is quite sweet as in china grandma take care of all exp the children it�s a huge set up with seating of different types the menu is quite elaborate and cooked better than many other restaurant of this nature it�s more like a nice home cooked meal you get here a great place to eat and have a god time esp if you have a good no of people you can order a lot and share food without paying a bomb it�s priced quite good and is absolute value for monies on weekends it�s better to book in advance as its quite famous and crowed place, located at nanjing west a lot of locals and expatswhose on the know alike eats here for their delicious and affordable food 100rmb is a feast here

once you get the 7th floor of 818 mall get a ticket coz this placed is always packed but the wait is not that long dont be fooled by the waiting area although it will make you think that the resto is smallboy oh boy are you wrong this resto occupied the whole 7th floor of the mall its a labyrinth but the interior is cool and the tables and turns has numbers on them cool thing about this resto is that every food on the menu have pictures and english translations yay waiters cant speak english though but who cares love the food the price and the atmosphere, the food is good but staff do not speak english menu has nice photos that you can point to when ordering food the restaurant was very clean and safe",NA,NA
345,"i been here several times love the food and the drinks great service always have a lot of fun here, the hooters chain has a location in luijazui shanghai the atmosphere is good the sports screens are there and the center stage big screen will give any sports fan what they want the service is nice and the food is good everything you need for a fun night out with a group of friends, we ordered portions of regular and boneless chicken wings as well as sliders with chicken and beef with different sauces everything we had was ok nothing spectacular but hey this is hooters and not a michelin star restaurant, in shanghai for the weekend and looking forward to a western experience upon entering hooters i requested a booth next to window i was refused even though the restaurant was completely empty i insisted and was told i would have to move if more guests came in boneless wings were excessively greasy had to use paper towel to soak up grease cooking oil tasted old oil tasted bad on fried pickles too

emily did a great job as waitress, its hooters with no hooters if you get what i mean for the rest that are expecting girls to wait on your hands and knees you have to understand the establishment you are walking into they hire young girls first time jobs and they are pretty but work isnt the first thing that comes to mind

the girls are friendly and they try to do the best they can to entertain you but understand again you have to pick and choose your battle good looking and hard working that is a needle in a haystack

the food is up to par it is no mind boggling food it is friend and greasy just like every other i dont get anyoe who comes here looking for a good steak

as stated if your expectations are right you will be just fine if you have anything higher then a bar with bar food then you are in the wrong place yes bring your card or wallet cause it is expensive to eat american food in shanghai, nice friendly place food food service awesome  had lunch they have a happy hour  patio outside nice girls fun to see out of north america, despite the branding hooters continue to deliver quite a unique experience even for families the menu is extensive the staff are attentive and the kids loved it located at the super brand mall in pudong easily accessible on the 2 metro line at the lujiazui stop the waitresses are fabulous with kids and we would certainly come back my only complaint would be the cigar smokers in the smoking section although that is apparently about to change, the restaurant served three main types of spaghetti the ones with meat sauce the one with meat and prawns and the one with meat and vegetables

the waiting staff speak english well and the atmosphere of this restaurant is very pleasing, i<u+00b4>m not a big hooters fan but this place was a quite dead although i must admit it was a weekday the service was friendly although the hooters concept did not translate well into local culture it came across as something else not sure what the beer was cold and the snacks were tasty and unhealthy just as they should be at hooters, spend 2 nights here as my hotel was not so far good place to find beers and cocktails hooters girls are friendly and have lot of energy  hope to come back soon, nice place with nice food many chinese girls serving and talking  regular hooters foods  crowded  good to enjoy for single or group of mans , lives up to its name good food nice beer and friendly staff who gave one of our group a birthday song, beautiful friendly hostesses average price for this type of western restaurants the food is good the play all the sports nice environment, we had been in asia for almost 2 weeks and wanted some beer and burgers and came to the right place the girls working here are very pretty and nice although some struggled with english it wasn�t much of a problem at night it was pretty busy and there was a wide range of folks there from business men to birthday parties to girls night out types periodically the lights will start flashing and some of the girls will get on stage to dance for a song or two while the others dance in the restaurant � very fun they had big beers and a full menu we all liked the food we stayed at the shangrila hotel and this restaurant is right on the other side of the block by the river front great location and fun spot to grab a drinkdinner, i had such a great night here last year with a group of colleagues the girls were great fun and very helpful the service really was fantastic

the drinks werent quite as expensive as some other surrounding bars and the food was reasonable

highlight was definitely the end of the night when we all got on stage for a song and the girls taught us their hilarious dance

fantastic place one of the highlights of my visit, two long weeks on biz trip to china and wanted to have some decent hamburgers was okay food was there couple of times with my chinese partner and couple of buddies from na if you want to have better food just go to tgi friday cross the street, fun  entertaining feed the staff here are a lot of fun and the food is good dont expect a 5 star meal as this is not what this is a good place for a nice feed and a beer and pretty girls, wow i just loved that place while i was in shanghai for 2 weeks had been there at least 3 times the girls are so welcoming and helpful at the same time and wow the drinks that are making are even better the food i would not say anything cause i didnt try it, if aim of the visit is to see the good girls with tight pants china is not correct place to do that food is good as usual  plenty of beer selection good sports everywhere chill cheese fries  burgers wings are all fantastic of course with cold beer, we enjoyed coming here to some extent we like the food for a bit of a change and they have some ok beers the staff were mostly friendly not all the food was fine the beer was cold but there are no nonsmoking areas and all the local guys were smoking and all the time were were there  this was lunch likely much worse for dinner
was also very expensive you can get a much better meal with drinks for less than half the price elsewhere so the only 2 things they have going are the hooters girls and the sports on tv the girls were nice not very enthusiastic but ok, we had a really nice happy hour with a good beer and chicken wings fried perfectly very close to my hotel, the place has a good atmosphere and is in a popular location walkways have clearly marked signs with directions to the restaurant

pretty typical american food but it is really good if youre an expat working in china and missing something from home

prices are higher than most other restaurants even for the area and the service isnt too great but since the vibe of the place is quite relaxed im never really in too much of a hurry the space is very comfortable and its nice to unwind here

at random intervals the girls do some dances and performances which is quite interesting, if youve ever heard of hooters then you will know exactly what to expect here i find it a nice change to find everyone working in a restaurant in china able to speak good english, who knew that a hooters would be the alltime best restaurant for kids in shanghai the staff at the huaihai zhong lu location in the ambassy club is amazingly friendly and they even have a kids menu the weekday happy hours are great, the place is located at the back size of the zhengda plaza which i usually frequent i tried the place since i love it from the states the staff is friendly and me and my friends had great time even taking into consideration that we took a baby with us the server was very helpful and friendly everyone seemed to handle at least basic conversational english which is good enough to take orders for tourists or visitors, food was alright cant call it great though but it took a bit long to arrive by the time i got my burger in front of me i was almost starving , i had to see what hooters was like in china im not exactly a hooters fan in north america but i was curious to see the chinese twist unfortunately i didnt get to see much of anything

upon arrive i was seated at a dirty bar it took a solid ten minutes to be served my first drink which was wrong when it arrived after drinking my overpriced glass of wine i waited for the bill which didnt arrive finally i left the <u+00a5>50 the menu price on the table and left

despite the fact that there was no service when i was sitting at the bar when i left i was chased out by two waitresses who said i didnt pay the bill i indicated i left the money on the table i reentered and pointed out the money then i was informed the bill was another <u+00a5>5 unknown to me they charge an automatic 10 gratuity

in north america i am a generous tipper this would have been one of the very rare occasions that i probably wouldnt have left a tip so i left the additional <u+00a5>5 and decided to write this review, we only went in to watch a sports game  the place is terrible our drinks took 25 minutes to arrive first 10 then 10 more for the 2nd and another 5 for the third the food was already on the table but came at equally intermittent intervals the communication was a joke and then  much to our annoyance  every few minutes the girls started clapping in unison absolutely shocking and very annoying, we had to stop in to see what the chinese version of the american chain was all about while the place was empty the wait staff was learning all of their dances and songs that is different then in the us if you ask for a water  make sure you say coldice i ordered a rum  coke and got a full rocks glass of rum and a 2nd glass with coke strongest drink ever the location is good within the mall and near metro, really disappointed with the service and food tasted like pure oil further the sliders came out with a cockroach on the plate that said the girls quickly caught it and asked if we wanted to change the plate i was really hoping for an enjoyable time but left feeling like i needed to regurgitate, good place to go if you find yourselves with your buddies and no female companionship the waitresses are friendly though they seem overworked hint to mgmt hire more kitty at the door and kiku at bar service were excellent much more authentic than the us make sure you are nice to them and they will reciprocate worth a visit to see the chinese interpretation of the dying us chain
relax and enjoy, only been to hooters in singapore so when our friends along with their kid suggested we go to <u+732b><u+5934><u+9e70> i was not exactly expecting hooters

great location in shanghai lujiazui overall a pleasant trip

the restuarant was setup into 2 sections the sport bar section with big screens and bar stools there is also a seatdown section with outdoor seatings which are great for families and for gatherings with friends

besides the food fare you expected at sport bar there are spaghetti steaks fish fillets and fried chicken which are servable for families with kids

since we were the first guests in the seatdown section the hooter waitresses performed a song for us this made the experience even better, we go to hooters as we like the beer and food this was good but the service was very slow looked like they were having a staff meeting during a very busy time wing although advertised as not spicy too hot for me to eat this was not the place for a hooters as girls not hooters material, i have been to a few hooters in the past i understand the concept and i have enjoyed the visits
the other day i was on my own and felt like some us style grub and beers i thought it could be fun
the only time i was given attention from staff at all was when i first walked in from there on it was very difficult to get any ones attention even only to order another beer when my beer was out
the girl that served my table were more focused on dancing with her staff mates and she did not understand english hardly at all i had to speak mandarin to get things done she did not know the menu at all when i ordered from the menu she questioned was i was saying and i had to ask her to read from the menu herself perhaps she was very new at her job but nevertheless very disappointing
i twice specifically pointed out that i wanted to eat my chicken wings first then later have my main served so the main was brought to my table about ten seconds after the wings i am not exaggerating
food was also very average at best one of my wings were icy cold at one end
my burger for a main was also disappointing nowhere near the standards of meals served at the restaurants across the street tgi friday and blue frog
i doubt that i will come back, this restaurant absolutely has the worst service and attitude even for a chain restaurant i live in the area and have tried 4 different times hoping for a change but it is consistently is bad before renovation last year it was a better restaurant, nice place to go to relax and grab a beer and some food good if you need something in english after spending long periods of time in china but service was slow not overly busy 3 girls standing around took 20 minutes to deliver the 1 beer i ordered and ive written this entire review whilst waiting for the check to arrive, a little piece of america for those from the usa  good if youre a little homesick

they have a big video wall with american sports playing and lots of other tvs around with more sports

the waitresses were cute and friendly but not as well endowed and fit as you usually see in the us i guess most of that is to be expected in china

we didnt eat  we dropped by for a beer since we were in the hotel right next door the waitresses did a nice ymca dance for us  very cute

all spoke english just fine beer was good  large glasses are the norm 2 liter if im not mistaken

allinall a fun couple of beers, we took our son here for his 12th birthday
ive been to many hooters restaurants in america and while it seems they are putting every effort forth to make this one just like home its still lacking most of the waitresses are pretty all are by default petite but not all are fit or worthy of a hooters outfit lots of pooches in the midsection and not much to work with in the backyard that aside they were friendly and overall service was quick and efficient
we asked one of the ladies to take a picture with our son  this is the moment that showed the least authenticity she stood straight up and smiled i expected the lean in and smoosh this led me to believe that overall they just dont get it the dark hose they wear here bothered me too these arent california girls they need a china white tone i found it strange but not as much as their choreographed dance which lacked enthusiasm and overall want to be there
the wings were just ok the beef and chicken sliders were pretty good onion tanglers were a hit at our table
nothing left me wanting or excited to return some guys might enjoy it but as for eyecandy there are other places, good value nosh from everyones favourite restaurant for spicy chicken wings the same the world
over with great fried food and a good range of draught beers, this is a case of taking a brand out of its native setting and not really working the food is us fake with adequate burgers and ribs the thin onion strings were original and tasty 2 for one happy hour was welcome and the cocktails pleasant the pretty slight chinese waitresses looked like high school children performing a dance intermittently through our visit with an air of self consciousness atmosphere came from watching the many screens show china winning their leg of the asian cup there are over 12k restaurants in shanghai  go find something authentic, i assume that is the same food all over the world i ate shrimps and although i asked for a non spicy meal the caju sauce was enough spicy to still remember it actually i prefer hooters in places where the girls are more equipped, on my recent trip to shanghai one evening i strolled to this restaurant as i wanted to have a light dinner the restaurant looked very lively and was lit up with neon lights as i walked in the restaurant  i was greeted by lovely girls in hot shorts and shown around the seat they handed me over the menu book and offered advice on selecting the dishes i selected some cocktails and enchillidas for dinner soon the piping hot food came taste was good and with some cheering and singing by hooters the expereince was very enjoyable and relaxing

i would definitely go back again, this newly renovated hooters is fun with the girls doing a reasonable impression of their american counterparts the service was quick extraordinarily so and the atmosphere was energized with the girls singing and dancing and getting the customers involved our curly fries tasted just like home so we got excited when the wings came unfortunately they were seasoned with a chinese spice that is very popular with folks here but nothing like anything hooters uses in the us the wings were fresh and juicy but that chinese spice makes the taste very different from wings in the us so we did not care for them

still we cant fault the restaurant for catering to their customer baseand our experience was really great just dont expect the wings to taste like hooters back home, exactly what you expect it to be american tacky and greasy
waitresses friendly but again you would expect thatno big hooters in sight so it may be a bit of a disappointment for the gentlemen but outfits are minimalistic enough best was their fried onion spaghettisstrings , simple casual fun dinner if you feel like a break from local food a good place for a beer and burgers staff are friendly and helpful, i visited this resturant 4 days ago with 5 friends and we had different meals and the food was really nice its typical hooters restaurants we ordered the crispy shrimp the big fish sandwich grilled chicken salad curly fries and nobody complained about the food and actually we liked it it took them 1520 minutes to prepare the order which is see it reasonable
sure i will visit this resturant again when i come to the mall, well we all know hooters and yes this one lives up to the reputation of having a lot of young girls dressed in short shorts and low cut shirts the difference here might be that the hooters close to the super brand mall in pudong shanghai was recently renovated and when it reopened it had a lot more room huge big screen tvs for viewing every kind of sports and even a band on the weekends but unfortunately the food is still just bar food not bad wings and burgers but the rest leaves something to be desired the curly french fries always come out cool to cold and to be honest it is a little hit and miss on the other menu items i was there just after the reopening so it might not be fair to judge the service yet but it seems that the staff is confused and that the computer system used to place orders to the kitchen might be too complicated for the staff to operate quickly and efficiently this means slow in food delivery it is still a fun place and the servers really do their best to make you feel at home they are genuinely warm and friendly and most speak passable english if youre looking for a night out with the boys to have some cold beer bar food and watch a football game this is the place, came to hooters pudong many times now the first time after they renovated the place lots of tv screens for sports now they dont serve kilkenny anymore why at least they have guiness
food is as to be expected from such a bar ok will return as it is a good place to cool down after shopping and on way back to ferry station, we went to hooters with 5 people waited 20 until we could order than another 40 for the first dish to arrive the rest came half an hour later i ordered my salad without croutons it came with my friend didnt want french fries he got them

food didnt taste very good either

i would strongly recommend not going there, under renovation and no date available for any possible reopening tgi friday opposite looks like a far better choice",NA,NA
346,"any food in china is mainly spicy sometimes even if you ask for non spicy they will bring little spicy even hamburgers in macdonalds are spicy after 2 weeks of eating only chineese food this turkish restauarant was real rescue for me

generally i like turkish kitchen and here you can find all variety of turkish food quality is very good and food is authentic i do not know who is cooking but taste is real same as i taste in turkey here you can find traditional turkish salads soups mercimek and other donars kebabs iskander kebab airan and other dishes taste is very nice serving is good and restaurant is clean and accurate prices are not low rather middle level for shanghai, i passed by this restaurant while walking around in soho plaza and made a note to come over for lunch during the weekend

i dropped in for a late lunch and other than me there were only two tables occupied

i went in for a starter of hummus and it was not as good as id have liked it to be element fresh does a far better job with their hummus

id also ordered a chicken doner

having waited 20 minutes for it to arrive it turned out that the kitchen had simply forgotten to make it and the staff had forgotten to remind them this with just two tables occupied

the chicken doner was fairly disappointing when it arrived

the sauces were watery and used sparingly which made the doner very dry in addition the meat was very stringy and hard

id not visit again, heard about this restaurant so i give it a try  i order the mix grill  lamb chops was good  adana too fatty for me  chicken was a bit dry  and the donner meat was too fatty  i also tried the pizza it was ok  just a normal turkish restaurant , this is my 4th time eating at this restaurant and it is amazingly authentic turkish cuisine the lamb chops are as good as anywhere and the grilled vegetables are a great compliment dont forget your turkish tea with your baklava for dessert, if you live in shanghai and have not eaten here you are missing out this is one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai you have to try the anteplim kebab it is amazing they unfortunately moved locations so i cant go there often but i order delivery every week, out of nowhere tpu find this nice turkish reataurant in shanghai very near to xintiandiawesome food and ambiance reasonably priced although not very authentic but surely a worthwhile to take a bite 

keep up great taste , anadolu is maybe one of our favorite restaurants in shanghai at least when it was on hengshan road 

nothing to say about it then  great place busy atmosphere excellent food possibility to sit outside 

so of course it isnt fair to blame the owners about the real estate projects that can occur in shanghai but to our opinion even though it might have been difficult to find a new place to rent definitely it is an error to have open such a place in a mall 

the food is still at the same level than before meaning excellent but this mall basement location just kills it all not because it is still empty but even though such a restaurant deserves a better place , this restaurant makes you feel the exotic turkish atmosphere in the far east landsmost of the foods export from original areas in turkeyyou can not imagine how you would be in while you eating your dishthanks to restaurant owner to bring this delicious things, nice place to dine with delicious choices of halal food a little noisy but manageable courteous staff especially the filipinos
interiors are amazing and gives a great feeling most important its open at late hours for club hoppers
a must visit for the club hoppers out there, the living legend of turkish cuisine in shanghai has refreshed itself and now has a much better outfit

new interior design with chic wooden tables and open kitchen add simplicity and beauty to this well known place

there is one thing was not changed which i found tonight was the food

it was as excellent as years ago
i reckon this is not a surprise as unofficial representative of turkish cuisine to shanghai murat usta  chef cuisinier still heading the culinary operation of this place together with erturgrul usta with the guidance of maitre dhotel metin bey

well done to the success of being consistently consistent

it is lovely to see excellent authentic turkish food in shanghai , ive been here twice in 2015 food is consistently delicious especially grilled meats and pan cake maitre d is such a kind guy who looked after the service very well wine list is limited but extremely reasonable price see you next time, tried the new anadolu with a friend the surrounding shops are still quite empty at the moment not a lot of shops have been rented out yet but the inside atmosphere of the restaurant is nice turkish music played in the background and the inside deco is also nice i guess the staff was attentive cannot say anything bad about the service

i had a kebap plate which was quite alright the best i have eaten in shanghai so far my friend and i enjoyed our dinner and we will probably come back another time to try some more dishes, i was already a great fan of the old location in hengshan lu but in this new place you feel the new energy boost and a much more innovative kitchen all the food are exactly as it should be but i specially recommend pide with spinach to be a little bit more provocative you can add some eggs on it sunday breakfasts are really fabulous and once i have it no need to eat anything till next day

very good job and it was also a great idea to move to this new location a little bit hard to find though but follow your heartstomach and you will find it immediately, my husband and i had gone to the hengshan rd location not realizing they had closed that location luckily we called the restaurant and was told it was relocated to the soho mall in xintiandi we took a taxi there but still couldnt locate it i called them again and the person who answered the phone actually said she would look for me and my husband so she may show us where they were as we looked around there were people passing out their flyers on the street one of them started to lead us to the restaurant when we found the other waitstaff looking for us without them we would not have been able to find the location in the basement of the mall the menu had a lot of options we tried a combination platter of grilled meats for two a salad and their yogurt sauce everything was very fresh and good the only disappointment was they did not have unlevened bread but thin pita placed under the meats and was soggy by the time we ate it i would definitely go back again, the place has a strong taste of modern turkish innovation food was traditional and delicious i lived in istanbul for 2 years and anadolu made a great job to make the clienteleb feels being in turkey service was attentive and friendly
perhaps the best turkish in china, been here many times before never disappointed until i tried to go this past week much to my shock the doors were closed and it appears that the ground floor restaurants on this strip with the exception of papa johns are closed  i really hope that this is temporary because i love this place many thanks in advance to anyone who can provide an update , we were looking at some places to have the traditional christmas dinner on the 24th december but many places were charging exorbitant prices and our friends suggested we try here instead

so instead of turkey we went turkish and im glad we did the restaurant interior is fairly average and the prices are a little expensive but the food more than makes up for that we shared the platter highly recommended and it was so good

you food was mouthwatering delicious you could taste the way it was cooked with every mouthful it was the perfect amount of food and filling enough without leaving you feeling bloated perhaps the sign of great food is when how good the food tastes dominates the conversation at the table and it had our group all talking for a while, i love the mediterranean salad and the meat platters are great the sandwiches are good as is the bread and hummus, a very nice authentic turkish restaurant with all the small trinkets on the wall reminding me of turkey itself a wide range of choice tea comes free with any meal very nice soup attentive waitresses this restaurant serves halal food for the muslim travelers, ah this place has absolutely delicious food from the doners to the big beef platters everything we have had here is just fingerlicking good the staff can be a little overbearing sometimes standing not far from your table just staring especially if you have children with you but thats a chinese thing and not necessarily the reflection on this restaurant one time the owner or manager not sure but he wasnt chinese caught them and scorned them after he had them step away they do smoke inside it is also a hooka bar but we were lucky we never happened to be there when it was bad, having spent quite a bit of time in turkey i was quite surprised to find a restaurant in china that has food as authentic as i have experienced in my travels throughout turkey
the lamajuen was incredibly fresh the doner kebabs fabulous taste with the grilled eggplant tomato and turkish hot peppers made for a great combination of mouth watering tastes our turkish tea glasses were always kept full and the dinner ended with a delight plate of baklava the baklava was as good as i have ever had with exception of the pastry made in antep
i will positively be back to this restaurant on my next trip to shanghai, the food service and atmosphere of this place is excellent we ordered a mixed appetizer with hummus baba ghanouj tsatsiki and accompanying pita bread it was very tasty the lamb i ordered was very nicely cooked i was very satisfied with the meal which reminds me that i havent been in a long time and will go back soon, eating at momos is one of the happiest things to do in shanghai
food is great the place is super clean for european standards every time i am in shanghai i go there to eat open until late
david, i have been to anadolu 7 years ago since then it did not change much in a good waystill in a good locationstill the service is low standart comparing to pricesand the prices increased like crazycomparing to other kebab houses in shanghai they are the most expensive with bad service and just average taste though the cooks are very kind to customershope they could educate their waiters the good thing is they are open till late time, i visit anadolu with some friends and we enjoyed the food their anadolu served great turkish food its a heaven for kebabs and they have a great variety of starters and turkish pides pizza try also their homemade baklava oh dont forget to try the turkish beer
another great advantage is they are opened very late and you can enjoy your dinner slowly and have a shisha, this restaurant serves wonderful turkish food and i enjoyed the chicken and beef doners as well as the hummus dips with fresh raw vegetables and delicious turkish bread however my friends and i found it was not a welcoming environment and there isnt much of an atmosphere despite the attractive surroundings at one time we had to walk out as the smoking was too much for us the nonsmokers may have to put up with annoying smoke from a nearby smoking area, generally disappointed by mediterranean restaurants abroad i usually avoid visiting them anadolu is an excellent exception of the rule a really positive surprise i tried several plates but i would highly suggest the yogurt with carrot as a starter lamb kebabs and lamb chops are cooked to perfection another good choice is the doner i tried the lamb one but i heard positive comments for the beef one too turkish raki is a must
prices are good considering the quantity of food you get service level is ok but can improve a lot the whole atmosphere is the closest you can get of turkey abroad
i recommend it as one of the best places to eat, i visit anadolu with friends and we had a great time there the food is autentic we had humus falafel and grill plater all the dishes were great anadolu is opened very late therfore a great place for people who like to go out and need a good restaurant to have a very late dinner by the we they have great shisha, good middle eastern food tasty value for money on a busy street crowd watching at premium outside patio in summer is a bonus",NA,NA
347,"after the dinner i come to drink wine this bar is near the okura garden hotel shanghai its little bar but friendly service in english visitors can enjoy drinking, nice little bar where you can get cigars and good cocktails and beer but above all the staff is lovely truly nice experience, it is newly open western style sport bar located at the center of shanghai you met people from all parts of world filled with large selection of beers ipas and whiskeys if you like every wednesday free cocktails for ladies would be interesting night with few friends

i enjoyed the food with ice cold beer in the hot summer friendly bartender and waitress always provide excellent service since i dont sing although the ktv room is meaningless to me but might be an adventure for others

the spacingsetting of alchemy bar is about right not too crowded but warm feelings a nice balanced between small and large bars that makes me feel comfortable coming in along just to watch tv with a glass of single malt whiskey is also a good deal for me

the alchemy bar is certainly a fun place i will visit them next time i am in shanghai, the alchemy bar is a great location to watch international sports games and races
the multilingual staff is very friendly and offer great service to locals and expatriates
i highly recommend stopping in when you are in shanghai on business or pleasure, really nice bar on maoming lu good atmosphere also nice selection of beers  whisky prices very reasonable for shanghai will be visiting alchemy again very soon",NA,NA
348,"i was with my friends and was an amazing dinner very tasty and good the owner treat as very well and the food tasty and natural, i stopped for lunch with business associate he had never eaten french food before the atmosphere is pleasant upon entering i ordered pork tenderloin wrapped in ham my guest ordered fish we also both had soup i had the mushroom soup and my guest had tomato judging by how fast he finished his food he seemed to like it more than he let on to the mushroom soup was decent but nothing special this is just the nature of the dish for me however the pork tenderloin was excellent the pork was tender and tasted very good with the ham but most of all the buttery brown sauce tasted great with the pork service was both fast and accurate i will come back here great food at not over the top price, went there for the new brunch it was great food with reasonable price on dagu lu we had a good service from the two french managers will definitely go back, good quality good price a little bit of france in shanghai you can find a french menu with french bistro food well located and good atmosphere, this is a surprisingly affordable french restaurant that serves great food i ordered an entrecote steak with sauteed mushrooms on the side a bottle of nice cabernet and potdecreme delish, in the past menue became quite poor miss the nice salmon and mashed patatoe and other good stuff on the menue terrass is still nice service is still good, best place to chill and eat and drink like in paris  
my friend lives there so she could show me around and make me discover this place
the food is very tasty the wine as well and now they even have a bakery so you can get your fresh baguette made by michael
see you soon again in june , we went to nova cool docks in waima lu next to the bund the menu is quite short but the dishes are very good real french taste the small apertizers tapenade marinated peppers or rillettes are nice to wait for the main dish the lunch menu with main+dessert is at raisonable price
do not miss the hot chocolate cake with salt butter caramel , it was a sunny day and lunch on the outdoor patio was pleasant even in 14 deg weather other than for the cigarette smoke

we went for the 2dish and 3dish lunch specials at 98 and 118 rmb respectively the duck rillete was a little salty but went well with the slices of french loaf as did the pork and mushroom terrine we both went for the beef and onion shepherd pie as our mains  it was not bad and the rosemary bits in there were flavourful though there could have been a little bit more minced beef

dessert of lemon tart was nice and tart but the pastry was a little tough if you are ordering a lunch set you can order a soft drink coffee or tea for an extra 15 rmb

service was quick and fast even with a crowded patio, was recommended the restaurant by friends nice reviews outside food came out too quickly a lot of the dishes were prepared foie gras was served on a very cold plate same with the salmon australian tenderloin had been flatten out to cover the whole plateoverall was ok but quality and prices need to be balanced, the restaurant was recommened it has a great location and view a little difficult to find could do with better signs
the red wine medoc was dissapointing at 300rmb i can get much better quality in other restuarants i had the bourguignon which was good but not the rich reduction i have had before my wife had a 250 rmb steak that was thin tough and not very tasty not what we expected for a well respected french restaurant, ive been to nova twice and enjoyed myself both times the first time was for a lunch visit with to sexagenarian aunts and we each had the set 3course menu and shared the pork loin was divine onion soup with gruyere baguette slice was perfect and the chinese chicken dish was tasty the deserts were all sublime especially the creme brulee i believe theyve since updated their menu but it was a decent amount of food for 118rmb  the second time my friend and i were dressed up and ready for a boat trip but unfortunately missed the boat so we settled for wine cheese and a cheeky dessert whilst overlooking waitan the portion of roasted potatoes and cauliflower cheese were small for the price 35 and 38rmb respectively but cooked to perfection the cheese selection was good we had port salut brie and saint nectaire its 108 rmb for the three kinds so a little pricey but we had a bottomless bread basket and some apple slices and a walnut each so its not bad considering its good quality cheese

the wine selection is fairly extensive though mostly by the bottle the specials that can be ordered by glass are good though and i had a really good virgin tropical cocktail for about 35rmb the melting chocolate fondant was perfect and had a delicious salted caramel sauce decorating the plate id recommend nova to anyone trying to impress on a date or looking to celebrate something special

as for service the staff were very attentive and most spoke english too though i prefer to try to practice my chinese and they let me do that too they even went inside to bring a table out for us as the terrace seating was full when we arrived its a great place to watch the boats sail by, hello tried this restaurant for a dinner on saturday night there are several nova restaurants in shanghai this is the cool dock restaurant reservation process seating ok service in english without problem good choice of french food entrees meat fish  only a few deserts price too high for the proposed food no fresh juices only orange my salmon was almost not enough cooked at the end a bill for 2 at almost 700 rmb first main courses and desert without wine a little disappointing not the french excellence i was expecting, first of all nova is an old restaurant for shanghai so if it is still alive its not by chance  its always easy to make better but for how long
in shanghai and in china everything starts fast and everything crashes fast as well

then for both nova dagu lu or cool docks quality service ambiance  all is always at the top with
> frequently new dishes
> good wine i will not tell you which one is my favorite to avoid a dry stock
> a quite stable staff which gives a friendly and known environment important when you are a laowai
> all that for a reasonable budget for that city

finally id say that after years of trials of good and bad restaurants often good becoming bad i dont question myself anymore when i want to eat french or even european i go to nova
cool docks on summer for the amazing terrasse with its view on the bund and dagu lu at anytime lunch diner 
even if im very picky i recommend nova without any doubt, novas food is always consistence we usually went for lunch and their lunch sets are very good if its a sunny day you can enjoy sitting outdoor but mind you its not a highend french restaurant so dont expect rich traditional french dishes here, i have been to nova for lunch and dinner lunchtimes are very busy as they have an excellent value lunch menu dinnertime they have white table cloths good lighting a relaxed atmosphere and very friendly staff including the 2 french owners the food is simple but well done the bread there is excellent finding decent bread is shanghai is a full time job and a decent wine list the terrace is wonderful when the weather is suitable for outside dining or just a drink the menu is small and does not vary often the portions may be a little small for some people and prices at dinner are a little steep for what you get however i will remain a regular customer, the food was really disgusting especially the chicken swimming in his brothhas it for lunch and today feel so bad and pin in my stomach, i went here for an anniversary dinner with my husband we had a lovely and delicious meal i ordered the roasted thickcut salmon grilled vegetables eggplant zucchini pepper with lemon butter sauce and my husband had the tsingtao beef tenderloin tartare with fresh herbs capers and garlic we were both very pleased with our main courses they were presented beautifully and had the perfect balance of flavors for the appetizer we had the escargot with parsley butter  a must have if you go here it was definitely the star of the dinner for me and was just meltinyourmouth perfect we also tried their spicy calamari which was very good and shared a salad

for dessert i had their chocolate lava cake with a salted butter caramel sauce and my husband had the creme brulee ~ both very delicious

the wait staff was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was comfortable fairly quiet and nice for a romantic meal

we had one problem with my desert ~ the last bite i found something that did not belong in the cake the manager quickly deducted the price of the cake from our bill and gave us two delicious dessert liquors on the house he also looked genuinely horrified about the mistake and said it should have never happened and gave us a sincere apology he handled it with grace and i was impressed with how he dealt with the situation

i will definitely be going back to nova for more meals , enjoyable night with good food service was good mostly smattering of ex pats and western tourists, i am not normally a big fan of french restaurants especially since the prices tend to be very high but i decided to give nova a try and i was not disappointed it does not have the pretentious atmosphere of many french restaurants and the pricing is much more reasonable especially the special lunch prices many restaurants dont dare to have steak tartare since it must be kept very well and be good quality beef the tartare at nova is really good

also being a french restaurant they have a good wine list you cant go wrong with decent french wines they are the best, shanghai is full of good restaurants and bad ones it has places of all levels and of all kinds of cuisine french restaurants are popular among those who have money to spend but not in all cases is the value up to the surface appearance
nova is an unpretentious pleasant restaurant and bar in a good central location without parking problems without noise with an outside sitting area for times when the weather is right when it is not right sitting inside is also fine it has a good french menu without fads and an excellent wine list i have been there a few times over the last weeks both for lunch and dinner both alone and with groups of up to 6 and was never less than satisfied my personal favorite on the food menu is the tartare with the house mixture my favorites on the wine list are the roussillion wines
excellent value for money, last night i try nova in cool docks nice view quietcharming and with minimalist deco
terrace outside has riverside viewservice is friendly and has good english knowledge
food is authentic simple but in the same time refined and well presented i will strong recommend to all my friends",NA,NA
349,"the menu is extensive we tried four dishes on our first time here and they all tasted pretty good we even returned for a second visit which is rare for us when travelling and the second time was also very good reasonable prices and good service it is located on hongyi plaza mall, had a great tasty lunch at this restaurant food was fresh delivered quickly and full of flavour the place is located close to the bund walk and worth a visit

one thing to keep in mind is that you will need cash to settle the bill this is not uncommon and the prices charged were very reasonable for the food we received, the restaurant is located inside shanghai k11 mall food is great and staff are accommodating although the service is a bit slow the staff also dont speak much english but the menu is written in both chinese  english and it has photos to rely on so you can still easily order they have wide variety of dishes from chicken to pork to seafood my fave was the bread that you dip in ice cream i already forgot what it was called but it was so yummy for a sweet tooth like me d, will you try eating at the place where u will hear loud of noise of chairs and plates are being tidy up that is made by waitress that are fighting to each other and release it to those poor chairs and plates our appetite soon gone because of these atmosphere and we also hear some of other customers complaint of the food that come so late and it also happened to us too even though we had called twice for them to bring it soon wont come back here, this restaurant is a good place to stop and eat if you simply want to eat decent food and then leave to get on with exploring nanjing east road shopping area the food is nothing special but most of what we ate was fine the best dishes we ate were the sweet and sour pork eggplant and noodles the service was prompt and although they werent as attentive as one might expect for the price point it was ok i think it is a little over priced for the menu offerings and overall experience but i assume that the overhead in the mall must be quite high i would go back again if i felt like a quick meal before getting on with my day, the restaurant is located within a mall and is close to nanjing road and the bund area

we went here for dinner on one night during my recent trip to shanghai the restaurant can be quite full at night so be there early especially if you are in a bigger group

the menu is quite extensive and has all items in both chinese and english with pictures depicting each dish this makes it easy to choose the items even if you dont speak chinese

the items we sampled included pumpkin soup which was nice and creamy but not overtly heavy for the main course we sampled a spicy prawn dish which had a nice addition of fried sweet potatoes organic cauliflower which was really nice and crunchy and a steam fish dish we did try a unique dish which was salted fish placed on a based on cooked mince pork the final item we sampled was a sweet soy sauce based pork belly the pork was really nice and succulent but the sauce was a tad too sweet

the menu has a mix of chinese and some western dishes we did not sample any of the westernfusion items as we were in china and wanted to try more of the local dishes

overall a good experience and we will return in the future to try their other offerings, theres always long queue outside the restaurant and i suspect its the same for all the outlets foods decent but really cheap probably that explains the queue too crowded for my liking, its a very popular restaurant near people square however you the food is ok not too back but nothing impressive theres a big problem of service we had to called the waiter several times and he seemed not fully engaged with his job not respectful to his client never closes to you to listen and using simple eye contact then we found out theres no manager around
wont be back, my experience was much the same as others recently reported on a saturday evening about 730 i had to wait ~20 minutes the hostess did not speak english and i could not understand her calling out the numbers of those in the queue ahead of me however i stayed in sight and when my table came up she made sure to attract my attention in a friendly way after ordering i also had the experience of waiting 15 minutes for my food before being told that one of my dishes was not available  a chefs special no less i picked another and it along with my other dish was served promptly after that i had the stirfried broccoli and curry beef stew both quite good with the broccoli appropriately crisp both dishes together about usd 13 definitely recommended, a variety of food which satisfy all tastes the menu is hugethe food is excellent well served fast and tastythe only minus is that not all the waitress speak english and the credit cards from europe are not accepted, during our four day stay in shanghai my husband and i came here twice because we loved the sweet and sour pork so much the best meal we had over our two week stay in china the restaurant is very clean and has an english menu for two entrees and two water bottles we paid about $25 total we had no wait the service was a little slow but that seems to be the norm and other customers were in no rush definitely would recommend its on the 4th floor in the mall not the 6th as some of the other reviews have said, it is a good restaurant for people who want to test chinese food but a bit adapted for western menu is in english and with pictures for 2 we ordered duck breast sweet and sour pork and fried shrimps only water for drinks pork is really good and duck also price was not expensive 169 rmb we didnt have to wait in a queue despite it was saturday evening and nanjing east road was crowded we were only 2 and it was 8pm, there a several charme restaurants in shanghai the report for this place is the one located in the raffles building right on the east side of people square
i have known this place for over 7 years and i have never been disappointed about their food it is consistently good their menu has not changed a lot over time but as it is very big it does not really matter just try it yourself if you come at the wrong time you may have to wait a while to get a seat, pros
decent price price is not too expensive the food quality is not that cheap
as an example i will describe the menu me and my friend had yesterday with its respective price cesars salad 38 rmb 4 types of meat pork salty duck honey duck and chicken with eggs 88 rmba huge plate of stuffed cucumber with garlic 40 rmb capuccino 20 rmb cafe float 25 rmb
good location close to the nanjin road station
spacious and clean place to eat
the drinks were very delicious the meat was fresh

cons
if you go on a friday be ready to make a line and probably no chair to wait
well this is a general thing in china but the attention to customers is not the best dont
expect too much
 food took a long time to be ready we had to call the waitress many times to get the food
and the check ready

in case
learn some basic chinese to make some additional request not written in the menu, china suffers from food security issues and one tends to eat with due diligence and care at charme restaurant at shanghai ifc you can relax the simple wonton noodles are springy  and you can taste the freshness of the prawns and pork in the wontons it is one of the few restaurants we would recommend  efficient service quick turnaround if you haveonly an hour for lunch, we were just wondering around in the mall when found this restaurant friendly welcoming host at the door really nice interior good view for the bund if you get a tabel next to the windows
the menu is huge you can`t go wrong choose anything all food comes with pictures so easy to choose prices are reasonable we had 4 or 5 dishes with softdrinks and the bill come up for 270 yuan friendly service but do not expect too much thats apply for all china
highly recommended for lunch or for dinner as well, really liked the food there and the menu has pictures with english translation busy place be prepared to take a number and wait for a free table in the evenings, what i like most is the spaghetti lobster and the ice cream served in the bread box
what i like less is the long waiting list before you get served, we came to this restaurant as it is close to the bund the dinner has been a disaster 24 of the requested main dishes were not available and we got to know that only after 15 mins we have ordered them then the dishes were served randomly without any logic starters sides mains we had to wait 5 minutes to get cutleries so the food got even colder than it was when it had been served food quality was just ok in the end the check was wrong as said 24 main dishes were not available but they were gently included in the bill anyway +100 rmb than it was supposed to be in total maybe we were just unlucky but the feeling is that there were too many things that did not work well, we were wandering around near the bund without dinner plans so we thought wed check tripadvisor for a recommendation this place was reasonably ranked and reasonably close so we gave it a try i agree with other reviewers that the food is good i wouldnt go so far as saying it was outstanding as i have been fortunate enough during my trip to have locals order food at other restaurants on several occasions and i have eaten better but it is a good value and the menu has pictures and english subtitles so ordering is easy even if you dont have a chinese speaker with you

be aware that they do not take american express or visa our little group depleted a good chunk of our ready cash to pay for dinner

lastly i read another review that said the chicken or ribs or something had fat and bones welcome to china friend even at the best restaurants the duck or pork is not deboned its simply laid out and cut up with a carving knife bones and all, read about this restaurant via tripadvisor decide to try it go to the one in raffles city near people park shanghai arrive around 5pm got a queue for 4 people got the table around 540pm for those who only 2 people the queue more faster try the noodle wonton soup chicken shredded shrimp with broccoli fried rice and vermicelli all is superb except the vermicelli is a litlle bit sour to our taste the price is affordable very recommended, the menu is huge  you can easily figure anything out with the pictures and english  everything we tried was great it is on the 4th floor of the mall directly across from the apple store on the bund use the east nanjin rd station on line 2, we have eaten in several places in shanghai those who have been know that means several standards of quality price and hygiene
one can eat fabulous food on exotic locations worried about the conditions under which the food was prepared but curious enough to try because it smells and looks so nice
charme offers you the opportunity to taste all these wonderful dishes in a very modern and light environment on the 5th floor of a very modern shopping mull or was it the 6th at a reasonable price went twice and was pleased on both occasions
very little english is spoken but the picture menu is easy and clear signature dishes are well marked and worth to go for
do go a little early because after 930 it seems to all stop
the pictures on wwwxinwangshcom give you a bit of an idea, my partner have eaten here a few times during our stay and will most likely go back for more it has an extensive menu that is written in english and it has pictures so you know what your meal is going to look like the food is delicious and it comes out hot price wise it is decent for the size meal you get and reasonable for the setting you feel like your in a 5 star restaurant like most restaurants you go to if your a westerner the service is not like home you have to call them over to get anything but i would definitely recommend eating here at any of there locations, dine in this restaurant for 3 times during my visit to shanghai find their food are good and tasty especially the dessert toast with a scoop of ice cream if peak hour need to queuing for more than 30 mins worth to try, we ate dinner here the other night and had a really lovely dinner the staff do not speak any english but the menu has pictures and english subtitles so ordering is easy
the food was delicious although the lobster dish was definitely not real lobster however the rest was excellent and good value for money located on the 4th floor it can be a bit hard to find but worth going to
friendly staff but it can seem like a bit if a canteen get a seat against the window to really make it enjoyable, went to this place on the last day of my trip in shanghai its very reasonably priced though the locals may beg to differ i spent roughly around 400 rmb for 3 people at todays price that works out at <u+00a3>43 and that included drinks our seats were very good and at the coveted window area although i did have to go looking for that table after being offered a table near the exit

food was good and varied staff were friendly and attentive

the only downside i would say is that all the courses arrived together including the signature ice cream dish that we had ordered as dessert peculiar, charme was not on our list at first we found it accidentally when were about to have dinner with a friend and saw a very long queue in front of the door since we were very hungry that evening we decided to come back for early lunch the day after

it was the right decision first their list of menu and also the picture illustration looks very tempting second the temptation doesnt stop thereit gets better when melted in our taste buds we ordered barbeque goose honey pork bakedmediterranean fish and beef noodle all of them taste superb undoubtedly its the best cantonese restaurant in shanghai

lunch is not complete without dessert warm chocolate cake is my alltime favorite and charme creates it perfectly the dark chocolate still deliver some bitter note at after taste mixed with vanilla ice cream really made my day, this is a surprisingly large restaurant in the upper level of a shopping mall it was unexpectedly good

the menu is like an illustrated cookbook and had so many selections it was hard to choose there were eight of us and we had a lot of food every dish was very well prepared and tasted great it was delivered promptly and unlike some chinese restaurants in a logical order leave room for their interesting desserts

everyone thoroughly enjoyed the meal and we were all surprised at how reasonable the bill was the only negative is the place can be very noisy

i will definitely be back, what struck me when visting charme was the presentation of the menu it almost resembles a cookbook with highly stylized pictures of the various dishes what also struck me was some very inventive dishes

what it boils down to is that youll have a hard time choosing but then its so cheap that it wont cause you grief to order a bit too much

they serve a weird mix of panasian and western food but what i ordered was really delicious and it appeared to be the same on the neighbouring tables

note that it is a fastpaced noisy place

paid approx 95 rmb for dinner and drinks, i are at the one in puxi with amazing views of the river and the bund the food was really good and the price was so cheap really recommended, this is an over the average restaurant in a shopping mall and worth visiting it is reasonable priced but its a very very noisy place

the food is great fresh and quickly served and you should at least try their dessert the famous hangzhou dessert is kind of a unsliced toast bread filled with banana ice cream chocolate and brioche cubes and is a fun desert to share, i went to their branch in union square area pudong nice and clean resto the price is reasonable and with big portion and this resto provides spoon and fork thank god i tried the spare ribs chilli beef grilled chicken the hawker noodle is good too only 22rmb but quite spicy spinach with three eggs shrimp brocoly with xo sauce love them all they also have daily soup but i dont understand mandarin but many locals buy the deserts are yummy too tried the bread with ice cream on top very soft the restaurant tries to balance the asian menu with the western menu they offer steak and salmon etc but the problem comes when you want to tell how you want your steak cook because the servers does not speak english much they usually have lunch special and tea time special the tea time is a very good deal with coffeeteacapucino plus fruits available between 2pm430 pm, i searched out this place because it was featured and rated in lonely planet
but on my night a sunday at about 9pm the place was deserted the waiting staff completely disregarding and the endless loop of cocktail music santa claus is coming to town drove me crazy
in their defence the food was tasty although i found the menu limited and run of the mill and the prices reasonable
but its nothing to shout about, situated in a shopping mall on nanjing road east this bright airy restaurant was heaving when we visited it despite some communication difficulties we were given a ticket to wait for a table to become available we only had a few minutes wait
we were the only europeans in the restaurant but felt very welcomed
interesting menu we are adventurous with our food but declined the braised large intestines and pickled bullfrog
portions are huge we ordered two starters lotus root in sweet sauce was fabulous two main course and two portions of steamed rice it would easily have fed four people
the food was hot fresh and delicious with two beers the cost was about <u+00a3>25
thoroughly recommend it, the price are very resonable  if you want to go here at rush hour expect long lines i have been to their branch in raffles and xujiahui i think the one in raffles are better tasting must oder is sweet and sour pork and their aubergine stuff with pork also their toast with ice cream  yum , this restaurant brand has another branch in the cloud 9 shopping mall in zhongshan park the menu is the same and the serving staff are nice and friendly but have a really low understanding of english so ordering is reduced to pointing at pictures on the bilingual menu the food looks good but when you get around to eating it the disappointment sets in i ordered the steak served with broccoli on a bed of potato puree the steak was cooked nice and rare but was chewy and tasteless it came served on three tiny florets of broccoli and on top of what is best described as wallpaper paste it was as if somebody had made instant mashed potato with too much water all decorated with a smiley face made from cheap ketchup bland and tasteless the mushrooms in garlic and cheese sauce was similarly bland i will not be back, if you love your asian food but want a bit of a break or variation this is a good choice its in a shopping mall on east nanjing road so a good escape from extremes of temperature we enjoyed a very reasonable meal and the food didnt all come at once pretty good price too we ordered a bottle of wine much to the disbelief of the waitress who thought we must have been mistaken in ordering big bottle the removal of the cork was a problem so my husband ended up assisting and the white wine was not chilled we found this to be common in shanghai local restaurants however an ice bucket appeared so we took our time all this was done with great good humour and excellent service this is a clean comfortable place for a simple tasty meal, its one of the favourite restaurant for me and all my indonesian friends to bring our family on visit because the food taste good and the closest to chinese food at home it always have long queue so plan your visit but the foods good so we keep coming, as previous reviews have stated a real gem of a place to eat being a lone foreigner always an issue but the staff are as friendly as expected good selection of dishes my favourite being the sechuan spicy beef noodles i still cant get used to the smoking policy so make sure you ask for a table in the no smoking section great value for money as well, point and order menu as english is not common due to the restaurant being mainly frequented by locals the food is excellent and vey good value and the dishes arrive exactly how they look it can be very busy but did not have a problem getting a table, very nice place to drop in the atmosphere quite ok though actually nothing special but the cuisine was really great ive been there several times and each time enjoyed my meal there, decent reasonably priced restaurant with some nice interesting dishes pretty speedy service friendly staff the beer was not really cold enough but thats not uncommon in china i was unpleasantly surprised though that they did not take credit cards other than a specific kind of chineseissued card and possibly discover be prepared to pay cash, i am writing about one in east nanjing road each dish is so big that you may have enough with only one main plate we were 8 people group so we could order and try many things its very common to share dishes in chinese also its not rude to leave the rest of food , charme restaurant was my go to place when i lived and worked in shanghai as the previous reviewer mentioned there are several locations including their charmant outlet at the ifc mall however my favorite place for great service consistency and overall efficiency was the hong yi plaza location there is such a variety of food to choose from you can have roast goose for an appetizer pasta bolognese a whole fish fried a peanut smoothie for a drink and a side of bone marrow on toast my favorites the red curry seafood pasta stuffed eggplant seafood risotto shrimps with sweet potato fries i had a lot of faves one of the most popular items to orderthe bread box thingy i ended up ordering one and its a half loaf of bread hollowed out with bread cubes rolled in butter sugar honey baked again and topped with vanilla ice cream almost every table in the joint orders it i never got bored with the foodselection and i did take out or dined in at least 3 times a week all locations are usually packed so plan accordingly, charme is a very well known adress among both locals and expats at least 3 restaurants in town east nanjing road the one here tibet road  raffles city 6f people square changle road  nine clouds 7f zhongshan park

however if you arrive for diner before 8 pm 130 pm for lunch be prepared for a long long queue you arrive you take a ticket and you wait that they call you if you dont speak much chinese its time to remember your numbers  after 8 pm most people have already finished diner so most of them start to leave and its going faster of course no reservation though there is a legend that if you plan one month in advance you can book but for 6 pm only 

the food is really good though the prices just got raised because of the continuous inflation 20 to 30 more expensive than before

their signature dishes are the traditional hk bbq meat the grilled egglplants with pork the amazing boneless chicken wings stuffed with shrimp and their bread with butter honey and vanilla ice cream for dessert

the restaurant itself is a bit noisy and because there are not enough staff its a bit hard to get a waiter when you need something but nothing terrible that you cant stand

average per person 60  100 rmb  person, this restaurant is in a shopping mall i believed 4th floor on east nanjing road and it was an unexpected pleasure i would say its a mix of chinese and western food presented in an impressive way which you normally only see in expensive western restaurants

the chinese eating there ordered enormous amounts of foods ate a bit from everything and then take the rest at home in little containers",NA,NA
35,"this is a well run restaurant in a quieter part of town we liked that the waitresses were proactive in recommending dishes and changing our cutleries the owner also goes around the tables giving a personal touch to the restaurant

we had dinner and ordered the cod fish and iberian black pork as our main the ingredients were of high quality and prepared well we felt that the black pork was slightly overcooked though all in it was a satisfying meal we will revisit when we next fly by shanghai, i have been there several time and i always had fresh and taste food i tried meat and seafood and both are  top level the best in shanghai, seve is a lovely restaurant with very cosy atmosphere it feels like you are dining in upscale italian restaurant in europe what really impressed me were the ingredients they use very fresh juicy and aromatic delicious food and excellent service generous portions, i went there last week with a colleague and we had cold cuts tortelli and pizza to share
at the arrival the welcome prosecco glass was very much appreciated and introduced me in a very simple but cozy atmosphere
cold cuts were good and served with nice schiacciata or white pizza = white bread made with the pizza dough
the pizza was thin and flavourful but probably the tortelli were the what i liked most
our stay was pleasant and the food was good for sure a place where i will return, we visited this restaurant to celebrate birthday in dec the place was warm and cozy and we were promptly given a table we had few vegetarian choices and the staff was reluctant to customise any to our needs after we placed the order it took almost 40 minutes for the first dish to arrive  we had better eggplant parmesan elsewherethe main course dish arrived 20 minutes later and none were something we would crave for we had a poor service and would not recommend this place for special occasions, this is the 2nd time i visited this restaurant previous occasion was to check the place out and this time had a group of 6 it has not disappoint me though it is full tonight food is simply delicious and really love all the dishes at least for those that we ordered service is good too and staff are very friendly pictures attached but does not do justice to the actual taste of the food simply love it, the food is good and with good variety well cooked and showed the look of the room is too much anonymous but located in a nice shopping area, it has been recommended from my chinese colleaguesthis is the best italian restaurant that i have ever tried abroad from italy extremely recommended , being an italian living in shanghai i am very picky on the food that i eat but every time i want to eat good italian food i go to seve i feel at home thanks to the friendly service always combined with superior quality food both the owner and the chef are italians which is a warranty for the italianity of the food there is a nice wine list and the food menu is complete from pizza hoeurs doeuvres first and second courses i love the pizza which is an authentic italian pizza but also any kind of starters which are delicious treats and all the handmade pasta
worth trying if you want to feel at home in italy when you are 10000 miles far away from bel paese, i travel to china occasionally for work and always crave good quality western food in between the numerous chinese meals

seve has a nice feel to the place in a good location and friendly staff i had an appetizer pasta entree and tiramisu desert with some red wine and enjoyed he quality and fresh taste of everything

i would return if i was in the area for sure lots more to try on the menu from what i saw, am already 20 years montlhy in shanghai and this was my first visit to seve  wooow super food wine and staff was good as well have a weekend escape place in puglia italy where im often and was feeling almost same if talking about the food  they have a good winelist with a super primitivo for a price which is more than reasonable knowing your in shanghai 100 sure that ill be back and if your reading this  so should you pity no more tiramisu was left but also means they make it for one day the way it should be, nicely located at the corner of the french concession this restaurant is really italian with an italian owner chef and food good service from local personnel and a friendly welcome prosecco, good atmosphere and high quality italian dishes  always a pleasure to come here severino always welcomes the guest friendly, what can you say when a group of 12 who all have different tastes unanimously agree it was fantastic the starters esp the calamari were fantastic and the mains beef filet could have been sliced with a butter knife pizza and risotto were delicious great service additionally the waitress knew how to cut off those at the table who had had a little too much to drink without them even noticing slightly higher than what you pay for in shanghai but given the quality and large portions youll come back, all that you need for a perfect dinner
 cordial service
 cozy place
 great music selection
 diversified menu
 delicious food
the owner was very helpful in finding a way to pay the bill due to credit card issues
i hope to get back always when possible
adriano, visited based on tripadvisor on arrival given a welcome drink food portions were excellent and so were the flavours also restaurant had many italian guests which was a great sign would recommend, we were a walk in a bit early and met the chef outside who said they didnt open until 1730 but he could make a pizza if the kids were hungry or we could come back in 30mins when they opened what a fantastic start we arrived back around 1745 no reservation and they gave us a great table starter grilled octopus beef carpaccio and tomato and mozzarella were really good pizza was fantastic steak for me was cooked perfectly and the pasta great my youngest daughter ordered by herself the ricotta cheese cake the waitress placed the cutlery down in front of her and then served the dessert i had a quick taste then asked the waitress the same one that took and served the order if by any chance the dessert contained sambuca

yes it did

game over


maybe im getting to upset about it but they all knew the dessert wasnt for an adult

maybe the kitchen didnt brief the waiting staff maybe the waiting staff didnt think it mattered

anyway was really good up to the dessert actually the dessert was also good just not for a child

not sure how to rate this because it was good but its the little things that make it great, after a very nice and warm welcome from the italian laoban  the professional waitresses arrived and left at the right time the food arrived in right order and at the right moment pizza 88 is excellent carpaccio is nice fondant home made coffee then grappa to finish warm goodbye from the boss i will come back feel at home i, what a great placereal good italian food in a relaxed setting you feel immediately welcome when you come in the door and the service makes you want to stay or come back soon and contrary to many westernstyle restaurants in shanghai the prices are altogether reasonable the only minor negative point is that i have had better tiramisu but that is a highly subjective point so dont be unduly influenced by my taste
oh and being 10 minutes walk from the jiangan temple line 2 metro it is easy to get there, i wish we had discovered this wonderful italian restaurant earlier we were looking for good italian food in the neigbarhood and decided to try seve what a wonderful experience we had we made a reservation for 4 and when we arrived our table by the window was ready waiting for us the owner severino bassani and his staff greeted us with welcoming smile followed by welcome drinks most of us were craving for good pizza so the 3 of us chose pizza and i wanted to try their unique lasagna in addition to few appetizers and desert food was one of the best italian food i had for a long time after meal drinks offered were the sweet surprise of a great dinner excellent food great service royal treatment for a reasonable price thank you seve for a memorable evening, seve is for sure the best italian restaurant in shanghai  we are from milan and we were living in shanghai with our son having a diner at seve was the best way to have good and real italian dishes  the pizza is really good also good wines  severino the owner is always nice and can advice you the atmosphere is also very nice and well decorated  i always advice this place in shanghai to all my friends , everything was perfect actually we had reserved the table a day earlier but due to the shanghai terrible traffic and rainy day we arrived 45 minutes later than our time the place was packed and our table was gone but the manager welcomed us with open arms while offering free glasses of champagne and asking us to wait for a few minutes we witnessed he really worked hard to open a space for us the quality of food was just great in addition the proficiency and courtesy of service in such a busy hours was beyond our expectations thank you seve, very nice place where you can taste italian food pizza pasta meat and fish good win list and pretty good service not really cheap but worth a try, me  friends we went here several times  and every time we enjoyed it tasty food lovely desert home made  good selection of wines
the manager is very friendly and helpful we asked advice for the wine and we was more than happy with the choice
the recommendations from chef nico was just amazing try the home made ravioli with ricotta cheese

highly recommended, lots of friends told us that this restaurant is great in all aspects so we went there on a friday evening

we didnt book a table and it was full when we got there we said we were willing to wait until there is a table so we stood there like almost one hour

lots of parties italians came after us and they even got a table before us they did not book a table either through the conversation i knew it

after waited for 15 hours we received a table

the food was ok not as good as expected but in total the service level was really not appreciated

bad choice from us will not go there again, i go to seve from time to time so i can say i am a usual customer and i like to bring friends or business associates if they are willing to try some authentic italian cuisine the global level of the restaurants in shanghai in the last years constantly increased and seve is no exception usually when you go to some restaurant in a foreign country being it italian in china or chinese in italy or whatsoever you go out with mixed feelings yeah you ate more or less what you wanted but still the taste is not like at home this is not the case by seve of course nowadays it is much easier to find the imported ingredients but also the italian chef in the kitchen takes care everything is cooked fine
i particularly like the fact that many dishes are not too much refined if you are a foodie you certainly enjoy digging in the food and this you can make here as the recipes are something that has a traditional taste but at the same time they are refined good choice
one of my favorite is the paccheri vongole e bottarga paccheri are large italian noodle where you can really bite in and they make them with a green sauce + clams and bottarga bottarga are dried fish eggs and gives a strong texture they serve it in a pan and even though i want to try other things i sometimes cannot help but order this one another strong dish are the spaghetti ai frutti di mare it seems the chef has a very good hand for seafood and they are really delicious of course they do not limit to this and if you like some hefty tasted they can help you for example my kid is an aficionado of the home made noodles with sausage and mushroom strozzapreti alla norcina and he does not let me even try them  i like to go in greater parties so we can sample more food to my opinion a shared pizza is a great appetizer and their rotoli kind of rolled pizza are outstanding too btw i learned the chef prepares on request special menus for dinners if required in advance wanna try for my next business meeting
anyway i do not want make a review of the whole menu just recommend a place that especially with the nice season coming you can sit down enjoy the french concession plane trees which makes so much europe for me relax eat and drink well and get a limocello after from the nice owner if lucky , i was in shanghai in business trip and like always my favorite italian restaurant is seve because the food is always goodmaybe this time even better i was not alone and like usual we ask some advise from chef nico it was a mix of sea food and meat but just deliciousantipasto with prosciutto and mozzarella some fried bruschetta octopus salad  omg  main corse with a huge pig steak and for dessert a nice mango panna cotta a good bottle of red wine helped us to enjoy the good mealand we close with limoncello, this place was not on my radar at all but a friend lives close by and took us there i was pleasantly surprised we all ordered individually but ended up eating family style because everything looked great and we all wanted to share our selected dish with others the strozzapreti alla norcina pasta with fresh sausage and mushrooms was the standout dish but the pizza with ham and arugula and risotto were also great as was the tiramisu and chocolate fondant dessert oh and i almost forgot the calamari appetizer which was tender and delicious too casual and unpretentious while service was outstanding ill be back, i went there for a quick lunch because its located nearby the hotel and i didnt regret my choice
i had a salad and a tiramisu and both were excelent very tasty and generous portions

the staff was good but sometimes i needed to wait for their attention with only 2 customers at that time
anyhow i recommend this restaurant, <u+4e0a><u+6d77><u+6700><u+597d><u+5403><u+610f><u+5927><u+5229><u+9910><u+5385><u+3002><u+5473><u+9053><u+597d><u+5403><u+4e0d><u+817b><u+6027><u+4ef7><u+6bd4><u+5f88><u+597d><u+3002><u+8d5e><u+3002>i havent been to an italian restaurant for a while nice discovery easily the best italian in town i cant believe ive never came to this place before pizzas crust is great topping is beautiful and savory pasta are home made great place to be, visited with friends and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience lots of competition in shanghai for italian food and this is definitely in the top 10 good selection of appetizers and mains with all the regular favourites well worth a try, i had visited seve several times when it first opened the food was good and the prices most reasonable i met the owneroperator mr severino b who was friendly the business was not up to expectation initially despite a nice location i came back last month and found the business as well as the food had improved significantly our family landed shanghai this evening and we just came back from a most satisfying dinner with sumptuous seafood soup packed with fresh clams and mussels fried ricotta balls with superb parma ham artichokes a pizza and the special sizzling pork chop marsala we finished off with the excellent tiramisu and the complimentary lemon cello if this is not michelin standard i dont care what is
the night of our visit is november 30th 2015, great place for a nice dinner if somebody wants to try something different then just chinese food we enjoyed the dinner and the good service, italian restaurant in the heart of the shanghai french concession nice location and pleasant interior design

rather traditional menu for an italian restaurant but at least for the lasagna dish the chef had developed the recipe to another level for me lasagna is typically meaty and lustrous but in this case lasagna wrap peaks were made out of single pasta sheet the wraps didnt have much filling in them and were baked too long making the upper part of the wrap too dry seems the filling didnt contain any beef but some dried ham also white and beef sauce could not be identified interesting idea but didnt work out

cold cut platter starter is rather small despite of the impression being big salad underneith is covered by the cuts in other similar restaurants the portion of this price is at least double in size

prepare to spend 200300 rmb per person without beverages for two dishes

we were three person but the third main course arrived only after five minutes and this only after having notified the waiter, the price are completely crazy a mixed seafood grill for more or less 80 euros its over prices for shanghai london italy everywhere over prices you are not at the ritz in london or peninsula hotel in hong kong you are just in a normal italian restaurant not so nice to tell you the true without any kind of view in a common sad street in shanghai so i can t understand why you keep prices completely out of the market we ate both pizza good to be in shanghai nothing to do with real italian pizza made in naples for example pizza was expensive we ate also a ridiculous chicken salad 4 little peaces of chicken breast no fresh salad but pickles salad so we don t suggest to go in seve restaurant and we will never come back, seve is a quality italian restaurant serving good size portions of well prepared food service is good and the wine list is extensive with some reasonable priced choices
not easy to get a taxi on a friday night, our large business group had dinner here and we all had a variety of dishes my friend and i shared a pasta dish as a starting and it was a good size the pasta seemed to be slightly overcooked as it was crowded the service was a little slow but this is normal in shanghai the pizza selection is huge and all the pizzas including mine looked good thin crust and with the right amount of sauce and cheese others had steak and soups the soups are too big to have as a starter steaks were ok and about 300g desserts were nothing special grappa was good, the title of this review already state what seve restaurant represent in shanghai food landscape

here we are not talking about a look like or wannabe italian restaurant abroad at seve restaurant everything talk about authenticity from the food to the impeccable and friendly service a broad selection of wines coupled with a nice and warm decoration make this restaurant an italian food galore in shanghai

either to impress your date for a business dinner or for some quality time with your family and friends in seves menu you will find what tickle your palate

andrea, we went a bit late our fault we were the only people in the restaurant they weren t closed or even closing but we could certainly feel the pressure to eat quick and leave oh this dish and this and this take too long to prepare for you
meanwhile what might have been a kenny g cd was playing on repeat at a volume that was a bit intrusive the walls were orange ambiance is subjective as is everything else but this setting was really flat and undesirable corp cool circa 2001
our carpaccio was meant to be drizzled in truffle oil i cd taste only lemon juice which made me fret
over the quality of the beef
good diavola pizza super thin crust very abstract distribution of salame the cheese could ve been better but you know a solid pizza overall
our vongole pasta was really delicious i think if i lived in shanghai this would be a great lunch spot, recommended by friends at the italian consulate we arrived with great expectations and they were clearly met while italian cuisine is really about good produce done well there was nothing innovative here well prepared pizzas solid pastas that were delicious sure it is expensive but the portions were ample the quality excellent and well this is shanghai a definite goto place, really enjoyed the food and the ambiance at this restaurant the pizzas were fantastic and so was the sea food dishes on the menu highly recommend this place for international travelers, held a party at seve we are regulars but they really pulled out the stops this time my favourite radicchio  red wine risotto didnt disappoint and everyone raved about the pizza great selection of starters great night out, we have been eating in this restaurant several times pizzas are very good we have also tried several starters and beef last time the beef was also of good quality and tender most of the starters have been very good last time i tried tuna tartar but it was a bit mild i would have expected more taste overall we have been please with this place and visited several times, seve is a good italian restaurant that serves fresh traditional dishes
however due to the large amount of italian restaurants in town  there are many bench marks to compare 
owner is very nice and helps to accommodate your request but may need to work harder to keep up with competition in town
rsvp ahead of time and try their pizza if you go there
they have couple of tables outside which is ok to use at night when the street is quite , as a chinese student who has been studying in italy for long time allow me to say seve restaurant is not only serving an excellent authentic italian food but also drinks and services my friend and i wanted a casual dining when we were around shanghai theater academy and we found this restaurant has a charming balcony which is very attractive and theirs pizza i have to say fabulous very traditional italian taste kind of bring me from typical shanghai streets back to warm italian town this extraordinary experience is nothing new in seve italian restaurant which undoubtedly offers the best italian pizza in shanghai the magiclike combination of mellow flour fragrant cheese and fresh meat of your favorite is the best incarnation of italian romanticism and fascination never hesitate to come for a memorable taste, during my annual trip in asia  i stopped in shanghai and i could not miss to go again in seve i found new interesting dishes  i tried orecchiette with broccoli and mollica fritta super delicious  i noticed with great pleasure that seve keeps renovating the restaurant decor and food menu service always attentive friendly and severino the owner is always nice to everyone i will definately visit seve again during my next year asian trip, love the pizza there especially when it�s hot the environment is cozy and the service is attentive basically a 45+ for this plus will return with my friends and family
ps tiramisu is so good and typical, great quality food some comments below are about bad service but we did not experience that at staff is very friendly attending and speaks perfect english

most definitely a place i will come back to and which i would recommend to others, being tired of chinese food after 3 weeks we decided to to try italian just a 10 minute taxi ride from the bund we were pleased to find what looked like a typical italian restaurant to our delight the food was excellent and we returned for a second evening to try the pizza thoroughly recommended, the pizza here is thin crust and quite well prepared although it could do with a little more ingredients i found the toppings a tad on the stingy side we had the crispy eggplant with cherry tomatoes and buffalo cheese and found that it lack a little kick as it tasted very plain and the buffalo mozzarella was only a tasting portion pasta was above average but nothing to shout about","Cantonese cuisine",0.534185506100146
350,"this is the best teppanyaki i have been so far the shrimps and fillet mignon are outstanding all dishes were tasty and fresh the waiter attentive and the teppanyaki show was funny i enjoyed the banana flambe if i would live in shanghai they will worth my visit at least once a week, been there for the first time good location and good service we had the all in for cny 328 that allowed us to try almost everything what to say we started with sushi ans sashimi that was prepared on the minute and was just perfect then we went over the meat and the fish on the grill everything we got served was cooked perfectly and tasted great the fish and meat used was of great quality when you watched to the colors texture of it you could see that its quality 1a i will be back there on my next visit in shanghai , taking the all you can eat menu is a fantastic experience meat and fish or scallops are so nice the cook is an expert good products and good sauces service is great and efficient big tables means siting and talking to people you dont know but thats fine as ambiance is really good beer and wine as you wish is too much but part of the experience look at my pictures , it doesnt matter if its the one in puxi or pudong this place is awesome the quality of the food is very good and the price is worth it dont forget to try both the salmon and also the fillet a must avoid the ice cream because it tate like nothing, being a huge fan of teppanyaki i was keen to try this restaurant however it will be the last time the food did not seem fresh and was not of a high quality standard most diners were opting for the all you can eat option and ordering way more than they could eat which left a lot over not a good sign and im not particularly a fan of all you can eat establishments as they always use scrimp on the quality did not feel too happy afterwards and all in all was not a pleasant dining experience, we payed about 320 yuan and then we had free flow of beverages and could order as much food as we liked but be sure to not order and throw it away since its considered really rude anyhow great restaurant and all the meat dishes was fantastic, we loved this teppanyaki restaurant in french consession very fresh  amazing tasting food and we got seats in a halfmoon shaped table that was shared with 8 others both watching the chef who was the star of the show so very friendly  social i guess you should ask for a table though if you want proper privacy we absolutely loved it brilliant value for money  fantastic ingredients and wine was included not super easy to find though our taxi driver dropped us off a few houses too early on that street and we thought we were completely lost as the road was very dark but it was right , buffet formula is nice all is included food drink wine included
food is fresh tasty chief is experienced will gives you an unforgettable experience
overall was good food ambiance service and for much more less than expected ",NA,NA
351,"we were recommended here for the dim sum and drove a bit to get here when we arrived we found that no one spoke english that was fun you can order from pictures and there are some english sort of descriptions but the process was more difficult than other restaurants id visited in the end there was no dim sum available but they let us order from the dim sum menu had fun practicing bad chinese overall the food was excellent i cant say the service was good  we were treated like foreigners and mostly ignored we received a few things that we were sure we had not ordered still it was a good laugh so a fun night overall taxis are readily available outside so getting back to a hotel is a snap, well the first challenge is to get through the gate past the guards as long as they know you are heading to the restaurant or getting married they let you in parking is pretty easy if you avoid peak times a bit and free of charge if youre eating in  amazing the normal restaurant is on your right hand side as you face the large wedding reception centre restaurant cant miss it besides there are plenty of helpful wait people ready to direct you to the appropriate place they are clearly used to new comers having no idea which restaurant to pick the dining area we were shown to was a small room holding 4 smallish tables nothing too fancy but nice leafy garden was visible to all out the windows the restaurant is within a park estate so there is no traffic immediately outside  a lovely change the food well it wasnt exactly the genuine cantonese wed expected from reading their advertising or menu but it was still nice enough and the selection of small size dim sum dishes was pretty extensive as other reviewers of this place have said only chinese is spoken by staff and used in the menus take someone who can understand good place for a lunch its a bit low key but the service is very friendly and prompt the setting is delightful pricing is very reasonable enjoy, visitedjun 6thsat 2015

i visited the restaurant with my friend at 1100 am
it was a quite sunny day so we had a seat on a terrace

the garden is quite large and beautiful
in china there are much car noise everywhere but here is nothing cause this restaurant is in a middle of a large garden

we ordered dumplings<u+9903><u+5b50><u+3001><u+5c0f><u+7c60><u+5305> noodles<u+62c9><u+9eba>etc kind of traditional chinese foods and tea which is a style of chinese lunch
basically i dont like a taste of traditional chinese food but heres taste are adjusted to foreigners
especially sweets are quite good
we ate a mango pudding and a almond jelly
quite rich but not greasy
if you visited here you would try it

total costs was approx 150 rmb per person
it was not quite expensive
staffs could speak english you dont need to hesitate to visit here
totally i recommend this restaurant

ask for an outdoor seat and prepare to enjoy no english on the menuno english spokenyou are really going native here but they were patient with us and the food was delish but more than anything we felt like we were in the country in the middle of bustling noisy shanghai if you can find the propaganda museum you have to try this place just across the street it was one of our best days exploring shanghai",NA,NA
352,"if you tired from a long trip in the city centre and you want italian or western food thats the place that will give you italian asian and chinese food well served high quality food the pizzas really tastya lot of food  1010 service 1010 food , delicious food nice view the service is top level what do you need more good company   and try it guys, this restaurant is located on the overhead walkway right in the middle of pudoing among all the skyscrapers the menu was varied in english and chinese and was easily understandable the terrace seating gives you a birsdeye view of the area but i opted to sit inside the bruschetta was very tasty and served with its own side green salad you get good size portions here and the price i found was very reasonable i opted for a chinese dish for lunch and found it tastywell plated and filling the maitred appeared tob be italian and he was very helpful on suggestions i would recommend this restaurant to anyone it is not haut cusine but doesnt hold itself out to be good fresh food excellent waitstaff and a view, i went to shanghai for the weekend and i can say that thats the best restaurant i tried in china wifi for free otpimum service and good dishes the cost is cheap there is a fantastic view on pudong area especially for dinner, along the elevated walkway through pudong skyscrapers i tried this restaurant that offers a choice between chinese and italian dishes well italian dishes are really italian including risotto enrico de luca the manager as well as the chinese owners and waiters are kind and give advices in dishes selection good meal at acceptable price considering the position, enjoyed the view and the meal at oyamee its a great place to sit out and take in the downtown area of shanghai there are umbrellas outside so that you have some protection from the heat in summer as well, a nice restaurant conviniently located near many attractions plane but nice food both ocidental and chinese pleasant service, good food good staff and more over people can speak english friendly staff and owner good views from the balcony, taking a stroll after visiting the pearl building tired and looking for a place to eat we bumped into oyamee we were warmly received by a waitress that ushered us to our table enrico de luca the manager came out to greet us and kindly suggested several alternatives from the menu catering our tastes according to the age group of our family i was traveling with my wife and my 2 little daughters 8 and 9 the menu was diverse enough as to give us the opportunity to have western and easter alternatives we had a selection of pasta pizza and korean bibimbap everything was delicious service was quick and very cordial they made us feel welcome result the entire family walked out happy after a great dinner that night tks for your great service enrico, if you like italian food you should try oyamee restaurantreally the sauce is different from other fake italian restaurant, i just recently this restaurant with couple of my friends for dinner and it was very pleasant the service was quite friendly and the outdoor terrace was great

their menu offers huge variety of exquisite meals we particularly enjoyed their fillet steak the consulting chef marco and restaurant manager enrico provide really an added value to this excellent restaurant and excellent customer services

lovely atmosphere for european cuisine reasonable prices, this place was awful we ordered a curry chicken and a pork meal and they were both miserable ruined trying any other places in shanghai do not go to this place at all, worst food ever chicken come out raw and carbonara was spaghetti with milk and bacon bits i am more than likely going to die now from bird flu if so could one of my family members please trace my death back to this restaurant as the initial cause of bird flu infection but in all seriousness dont eat here, visited this restaurant on my travels to shanghai in march 2013 if you get tired of eating rice etc this restaurant is well worth a visit a little off the beaten track chinese tower 2nd floor line 2lujiazuiexit 3 of the metro near pearl tv tower

oyamees offer a 2 or 3 course british menu if required i ordered the mushroom soup on recommendation which was really good the fillet steak and small roasties and veg was superb a good wine washed it all down and you can have apple pie to follow all for approx <u+00a3>16 a south korean customer who had the salmon salad starter followed by his main of 3 lamb chops also enjoyed his meal a few other people we know who eat here said that it was a long time since they have had a steak like the one at oyamees

we were told by the friendly staff that the chef is french and has travelled all over the world working in various restaurants before settling in shanghai",NA,NA
353,"we came here with my husbands friends who are living in shanghai we had a difficult time finding this place at first because we started walking into xintiandi when this restaurant is located more on the outskirt the decor is very interesting  a lot of the tiffanys turquoise color being thrown around we were unable to make a reservation so we arrived early ~530 pm to beat the evening rush and got a table pretty quickly

it was nice coming with 4 people because we got to order more dishes the standout was the cabbage dish and a beef one with lots of peppers i cant handle tonguenumbing spice so our friends were very nice and ordered dishes that werent too hot that being said if you are looking for absolutely genuine sichuan food maybe this place wont do it for you still better than the sichuan places ive tried in new york, second time here and i must say the food is genuinely very good

even though the first time round the ott over the top or in this case over the tiffany hues and outfits of the wait staff immediately triggered a notion of a pretendtobe sichuanese fare i am probably swayed by too much dining in chengdu and chong qing in sweltering very basic local restaurants

i have grown to love sichuan fare and must get my fix rather regularly maurya  whoever can understand how they connect such english names to kong que  sure beats me  is very good food and rather nice and cool and i feel reasonably priced try it and doubly pleasing is ability to buy a nice bottle of wine from ole supermarket downstairs i am at the kerry centre branch opposite swanky jing an shangri la  the lovely abode i was putting up in  and just pay y 100 for corkage, i love the xintiandi district and a am always looking for new restaurants to try both the food and service were good but not memorable on a scale of 1 to 10 for sichuan food i would give this establishment 5 12 stars the theme of light blue decor left me less enthusiastic about eating here the hot sour soup sichuan beef green bean and cabbage dishes that were ordered came well prepared but i was not dazzled not sure if i will be back, i had a dinner with my fellow chinese business counterparts at the restaurant we waited for 45mins on a weekday evening before we could get our table very systematic method by using qr code where you can add onto wechat to monitor your turn service level is very good in china context food was decent but not excellent as i have tried nicer one before environment is comfortable and suitable for both business as well as families, theres three branches in shanghai one  kerrys jing an been there once in may another branch in xintiandi but today i decided to visit their branch  grand gateway

its all here anything but spicy give it a try the szechuan fish was very good prawns werent fresh its been frozen for way too long

other dishes were acceptable, weve been to two of their outlets same chic tiffanyco colours for the waitresses uniform and the furniture the menu is shorter than at southern beauty outlets but everything is good and its a bit cheaper the ox tongue is spicy but doesnt numb your tongue, finally got to go to maurya in the kerry centre all in all it was ordinary at best
one of the dishes we ordered was not available and the other were nothing like some of the other beautiful sichuan food we have experienced in shanghai i would give this place a miss as there are plenty of other far superior sichuan places in town, i went over to their outlet in kerry center for lunch with a colleagues

keep in mind that this restaurant is very popular and therefore always very crowded we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table

the decor is ok and the tables are a bit too close to each other for my liking

the menu thankfully has english descriptions as well but the staff do not speak much english

we ordered two chicken dishes deep fried chicken with peanuts and chili in chongquing style and stewed diced chicken with cashew nuts in chili sauce my colleague ordered porkshrimp balls we ordered white rice as well the deep fried chicken dish was very mediocre and i never did find a single peanut the stewed chicken was a bit better the staff mentioned that they also charged for regular water

our food came fast but we had to wait over 15 minutes and remind the staff on 5 instances before our rice made an appearance

in all not a place worth the wait, i read several unfavorable reviews prior to dining at maurya that i have trouble dignifying having now enjoyed an incredibly pleasant meal there i walked past the restaurant and was instantly enticed by its fresh clean and modern decor although it was the glimpse of a massive bowl of fish filets bathing in chili oil that i decided i needed to try it firstly the service was truly lovely and better than what i have experienced at several bund restaurants i felt welcomed and well taken care of the waitresses wore clean matching teal dresses that matched the light teal decor i ordered the frog legs in a chili ginger sauce and really enjoyed its fresh ingredients and savory flavor i dont even like ginger very much which speaks volumes for how good the food was also it was not soaking in a liter of oil like several other reviews stated i do agree that it was not nearly as spicy as i would have hoped then again i eat raw chilies without a second thought my dish had three chilies displayed next to it indicating that it was one of the hottest plates served although i did sport a runny nose i didnt break a sweat it wasnt tremendously spicy but it was spicy nonetheless more expensive than your average hole in the wall the total came to 128<u+00a5> with a beer they also take international cards dinner at maurya was too refreshing and too delicious to not treat myself once more before leaving shanghai if youre not a die hard spicy food fanatic and youre looking for cleanliness quality service and flavor then you really should try maurya, having lived in chengdu and sichuan for over 25 years i was excited to see some sichuan food near my office looking at the menu i found many familar dishes i loved from my days as a chengduren a simple lunch for three turned into a frustrating lunch we ordered 4 dishes a couple veggies mapo tofu and fried rice the mapo tofu was nice and spicy however we never got our fried rice after asking the wait staff more than 4 times we waited for over 50 minutes for simple fried rice never arrived unfortunately my chinese is not proficient enough to thoroughly complain and express my dissatifaction never did a manager come to visit but they did take the rice off the check i may give it another chance but not when i am on a work lunch i was extremely disappointed as the rice is a nice match for the mapo tofu maybe it was just a bad day for the rice cooker, my colleagues and i went to treat our guest from the uk at the restaurant in gateway mall in xuijahui we had a private room good for 10 service was prompt and all the dishes we had were tasty

the drinks are expensive though rmb 98 for a pitcher of fruit juice

reservation is a must to guarantee a table as the qeueu tends to be long, what a great sichuan food restaurant good food wide choice and nice service as well as good atmosphere and location very nice xintiandi restaurant, we chanced upon this lovely restaurant while walking around xintiandi the wait is quite long but the food was very good we ordered their taro soup and it was very delicious the other dishes we ordered were likewise yummy, we were taken here for lunch by a friend who picked out a few dishes for us to share the green tea was lovely and refreshing and the food was delicious we had noodles with beef rice with beef chilli chicken and aubergine in spices as well as a tofu dish and some pork dumplings the portions were big and with four of us sharing there was still lots of food left over at the end the venue was moderately busy and staff were attentive really enjoyed our visit and would definitely recommend, found this by chance while walking to xintiandi unexpectedly delicious oily but its common for chinese food went there for dinner for 2 consecutive days, we happened upon maurya by change on a layover in shanghai walking into the restaurant was lovely  calm colours greys and peacock blue we had a table looking onto the street and could people watch a server with some english was found and was most helpful the menu was bilingual with photos so our choice of plates was easy since it is sichuan note the level of hot spices service was attentive and we were accuratley told how long to expect to wait for a dish the garlic prawns were excellent the prices are not inexpensive although the area behind the restaurant is quite western it is lovely for strolling, ive been here a few times and this place has really taken a turn for the worse it is close to chinese new year but service was really really slow lunchtimes need to be quick and snappy this one seemed to take forever

one dish wasnt available but no one told us when we ordered

but the food is good and ill be forgiving enough to try again at a different time of year, being a sichuan food lover i had some expectations when going there the design and atmosphere of the restaurant are very nice with a focus on turquoise color and some decor elements reminiscent of a peacock which is actually the chinese name of the restaurant the service is excellent and very attentive the menu has all the sichuan cuisine favourites and all the dishes i have tried were very well prepared ill be back for sure, dined here last night with a local colleague and the food was amazing decor was also very groovy check it out, the preparation of the food and the interior design at maurya restaurants is incredible they do a great job

the menu is comprehensive and has large color photos excellent for foreigners locals sichuanlovers dine here too

prices are high but not too bad for an experience like this, we went to another branch in the kerry center at jingan temple the restaurant is located in the 4th floor immediately one key element strikes the interior is totally different from most szechuan restaurants in shanghai dominant colour is tiffany peacock blue  seats have a velvet cover overall it feels like a tea room in an elegant new york 5th shopping temple there are much more tables for parties of two or four than in normal chinese restaurants  but you can observe that they have large rooms private rooms in the back
we came little late on a monday by local standard around 2015 and still the place was full with a younger professional local crowd who seemed to enjoy the food  we were the only expatriates
the menu is focussd on szechuan classics and not diluted with some local dishes and you find only few modernized versions they have not only the great classics like beef in hot oil the gong bao and dan dan noodles but also a number of local classics that you find less in szechuan restaurants in shanghai specially those catering foreigners eg a lot dishes with rabbit and local fishes from szechuan as water bees
and they really focus on szechuan while some of the other well known places infuse their menue specially the show off part with cantonese or other cuisines prestige dishes  you wont find here sashimi or shark fin soup 

we ordered okra in garlic vinaigrette pickled baby lotus braised beef in hot chili oil with silk tofu braised beef with scallion correctly the service suggested virgorously to order instead a chicken or pork dish but we insisted on our wrongdoing of having two beef dishes boiled fish in sour curry some dumpling in hot chili oil
the conclusion is that the place is really great  the food is so good that we make it one of the prime picks for future visits when we crave for szechuan food

highlights
 they have small portions of nearly all dishes on the menu  even if service refused some of the ordered small portions  only large available so apparently the good intention of the owners is not applied everywherebut if you order 3 small dishes per party and you may have even some leftevers for taking home  so if you are just two really keep with the small portions  if not extra hungry
 the use of chili and ma la pepper is still authentic but contained  it burns but no need for extra coconut milk for those who know and like the real level of spicyness it may be a little too much contained
quality of ingredients clearly above the average specially beef and fish was of good quality compared to the average
balanced use of oil and precise cooking  one singnatur detail they fry the garlic to smoky  sweetness and prevent it to get those bitter  burned taste which you sometime get in other places
 and one impression that i cannot prove except through the selfobservation in the hours after the visit  i would guess that they use less maybe even much less msg than other places at least on that day
 service is very kind  still a little shy but very polite gives some good guidance do not order two beef dishes  and effective
we liked all of our dishes the okra was fresh the lotus sprouts very spicy with the burn of invisible chili oil the oily beef was tender and the silky tofus paired very well with concentrated oily spicyiness of the meat the scallions of the braised beef were perfect  crunchy and still fragrant while the meat had a vigorous flavour that absorbed well the melty sweat smoky fried garlic
we ordered yeollow wine  the very basic one it paired well with the food but you can order from full range wine list various international wines and they have also a longer than usual list of local spirits
bring here you expatriate friends who may still think that chinese restaurants with traditional food have to be unlegant large places which huge tables  just to get a lesson on how the food scene is changing its also a nice location for a romantic date  even if the place is still a little noisy
so why just very good  it is a borderline choice
 i found the use of salt a little too much adjusted to shanghai taste so while still using salt some of the dishes eg the okra  could have benefited from a pinch more of salt
 while the seasoning was mostly perfect i found dishes would have benefited from a little more vigour  a little addition of garlic in the beef and a little more of pepper in the beef  but this is my personal taste  maybe a lot of patron would contradict me prefer this more elegant use of spices
it is definetly worth a visit, amazing sichuan food came with coworker that grew up in sichuan and he was delighted great convenient location restaurant faces street english menus with pictures, this is about the xintiandi branch not the branch listed

authentic sichuan food is not easy to find in shanghai but this is certainly among the best i have found decently hot without burning the stomach lining and quickly prepared and delivered

oddly the only thing we had trouble with was the rice which they had run out of fair enough it was a lateish lunch but the warmed up cold rice that was delivered had not been properly warmed up and the inevitable unhappy customer was the result this was put right by apologetic staff and all forgiven

price was very reasonable",NA,NA
354,"once you find the entrance you go upstairs to find a beautiful bar with indoor and outdoor seating we sat outside on the balcony overlooking xintiandi there is a large selection of drinks and cocktails all the cocktails we had were excellent we will be back on our next visit in september, great experience and good break from the busy weekend night crowds depending on where youre seated in the bar you get a view over the walkway below it was nice to people watch for a while
cocktails are expensive a$2530 starting at roughly 200 rmb but it is a nice place for a drink in an expensive area of town
would return
excellent service, find your way up the stairs to the devils share and you will find one of the best cocktail bars in the world the bartender really knows his stuff and makes a mean manhatten and old fashioned what more do you need

you can also enjoy a cigar with your cocktail and some great jazz sounds

this will be one of my must visits in shanghai, this is billed as a whiskey bar though i stuck with negroni the four of which were excellent fortunately this place has large and opening windows so even if there are smokers you can still breathe as long as you get a table right next to the window recommended particularly in the early weekday evenings before it gets crowded, nice cosy bar upstairs in the pedestrian area so many options for whiskeys single and blended also have cigars nice pay bar are with seating and some other seating too quite intimate and nice jazz music playing not too loud have snacks too and option of other drinks the cocktails looked good nice little find, we visited here twice during our trip to shanghai and i must agree with the below that they serve the best old fashioned in shanghai the head bartender brown was very serious and professional the the drinks he made were full of details, some friends bring me here to taste some special whisky and to smoke a cigar nice location friendly staff something different inside xintiandi, great place to relax and have a drink in xintiandi great atmosphere and great views if you sit outside, with this one theres no middle path you love it or hate it i loved it the w sour was first class and when i asked the guy at the bar how did he do it he went on real depth like a curator of an art exhibition, cozy little whiskey hang out for the chic crowd right in the heart of xintiandi hard to find if you dont know where youre going well stocked whiskey bar with an envious single malt menu a few outdoor seats provide a relaxing summer evening drink but get there early, just visited with 4 friends  two of which appreciate good whisky
to be honest unless whisky is your passion and there are no more than 4 of you and you enjoy a really subdued atmosphere in cramped conditions then give this bar a swerve we had a buffet at the end of the table and my friend had to lose constantly to let the waitress through not being a whisky man i just wanted a beer and the cheapest was gbp 1000 which even by shanghai prices is over the top
wouldnt visit again, classic bar in xintiandi very nice athmosphere and friendly personnel a place for whiskey lovers in heart of xintiandi",NA,NA
36,"went there with three couples during shanghai dining week and enjoyed a 5 course dinner food quality was execellent and very tasty we took two bottles of spanish wines with fair prices after dinner we changed to roof top bar for a drink bar is very well equipped and arabian  spanish style decorated shishas available mixed people, there is indeed real magic in the ambience of this restaurant in an arabic  style beautiful house inside the park we went in couple ordered and shared many starters to remember beef salad and shared the roasted suckling pig deserved to be called signature dish which made us marvel total a bit less than 800 rmb for two but we did not drink much wine but had cocktails instead for a good dining experience  staff is efficient service timely modern music from the the second floor bar side where people hang for drinks next time we will try the paella for two, really cool and you most likely wont stumble across it if you dont know about it a multi level bar  restaurant if you can find a seat head all the way to the rooftop at night for a drink, downstairs is a nice restaurant food is normally priced not cheap more upper mid range food quality is okgood service was good i ordered the fish of the day and thats what i got no rice no veggies no potatoes my friend had the pasta which to me looked like nothing special
upstairs is a hooka bar lots of shisha and drinks packed with people no room to get a table or chair looked like mostly expats relaxing i would think you would have to go early or prebook and table
id go back, we found barbarossa by chance as we walked through the park the set lunches are lovelystaff very friendly and views good through the park, my friend brought me here to enjoy tapas and a quiet cocktail while the food was nothing special the ambiance was downright magical my friend who lives and works in shanghai tells me she comes there sometimes and the place always makes her proud and happy to be living and working in one of the most dynamic cities in the world, i went here with family and tried out a variety of their dishes the cheese selection had quite a lot of variety yet all were consistent in their taste delivery i also had the salmon and squid and i must say this was my favorite the sauce was scrumptious and the salmon crust was delicious the steak salad and fish were also quite nice
though it isnt cheap in anyway i think the lovely setting and fantastic food overshadows the price to an extent, great place  great service and foreigners welcome  also great venue  a meat cook well as request, it is beautifully situated in peoples park overlooking the little lake after an enjoyable morning sightseeing we were looking forward to lunch here was perfect

we had ravioli and lasagne accompanied by a salad they were all very tasty we finished with a coffee and cappuccino

the staff were grand coupled with the appealing location we had a pleasant and relaxing time, well positioned this place right by the lake in people<u+00b4>s park here you can find some delicious arabic food i love arabic cuisine also you can taste asian influences love the outdoor setting the night we went they had a great dj playing which added to the atmosphere we enjoyed some drinks here and was a great way to start our evening, amazing barrestaurant went there in the evening looked like fairy tale had some delicious snacks and cocktails, its like discovering the secret garden this lovely structure is surrounded my a lake with picturesque lily pads on the weekends for brunch you can sit al fresco and you can sit there mesmerized by the shimmering of the pond lovely for evenings too has a turkish theme has sisha ideal for date night, absolutely horrible plus a rip off the setting is very nice but forget the food have an extremely overpriced drink experience, located inside peoples square in the middle of shanghai this is a nice place for enjoying the dinner
i had grilled garlic and chili prawns for starter and an angus steak for main course both where well made and tasted great my colleague had a caesar salad and lamb for main course
both where good however the salad was big enough for two
atmosphere was good and a place i would also like to go with my wife
after dinner we had a drink on the roof with a nice view of the skyline, i used to hangout to barbarossa lounge located on the 2nd floor during my working period in shanghai and i will say that in this place you feel like homeservice is really nice and attentive and the drinks are superb i am always enjoy the hh with friends but last week we come in for dinner and it was the first time for me and unfortunately i was not very excited with both food and service
order for a lamb shank and paella that we have request without chicken but we get the paella with chicken and lamb shank was ok for the taste but the tomato jam really sweet and overpower the entire flavor of the dish after we speak to the waiter about the chicken issue the waiter aknowledge but did not try to go extramile
after the dinner we went upstairs and we get in touch with tony that offer for us a round of shot and give some discount
also don and bryan pass by the table and greeting us  i know this 3 gentleman and they are really good
will definetely come back on my next trip to shanghai
still the best bar for drinksperhaps guys looking at your food and service situation at the restaurant downstairs, the lunch salmon lentil vinnegrette was an excellent lunch choice the setting on a water in peoples park is very relaxing and the staff nice, really nice location in the middle of a quiet park quite cosy and original in town perfect place for drinks and smoking shishas but food was so so, nice location in the middle of shanghai the brunch food was good and the value is ok staff was very friendly and good, weird mix of spanishlike food and chinese shrimps with garlic and chili were not todays catch to put it like that mini burgers spongy chips not bad risotto good lovely spanish potato omelet but no bar in spain would serve it that runny good selection of smoothies berry smoothie was excellent enormous drink list staff friendly attentive and with good english boring neverending jazz in the background but thats me, we been there sunday night  we went to the second floor  small
bar with a little terrace outside  nice music  nice people  really enjo it , this place is really cool either indoor and on the roof top music is cool and choices for cocktails is super  no doubt about that however its definitely pricey, i went to barbarossa twice while i was in shanghai after seeing it recommended in a lonely planet guidebook the first time some friends and i were just out for drinks and were seated on  i believe it is called  the casbah terrace on the roof with a great view of the citys skyscrapers above us our waiter was attentive but not pushy and had a good sense for when we were ready for more drinks even as dark as it was

we each enjoyed a cocktail and a beer and the bartenders at barbarossa definitely know how to mix a drink a sucker for mojitos and gin both i had a moginto a drink i would definitely like to see on more menus now that ive had it here the drinks were on the pricey side but in the way that you get what you pay for if youre looking to get wrecked this is not the place to do it if you want to savor a wellmade drink it is well worth it the atmosphere does a lot to enhance the experience

we also enjoyed a shisha what i would have called a hookah my friend said it was a little weak with not much smoke coming out but i dont have much frame of reference regardless we all agreed that it tasted good and we enjoyed it nonetheless it wasnt terribly expensive either as far as i can tell a few days later i was at a hookah bar in osaka where it was much higher

the next night i went back for dinner by myself i arguably enjoyed the atmosphere more down in the first floor dining room the music was jazz at a more reasonable volume we had to shout over the dance music up on the casbah terrace which is not so much a problem as an observation the decor is lovely with goldlit chandeliers dripping down from the shadows of the ceiling in the mood to try out a variety of dishes i ordered a few tapas rather than a full meal i had the softshell crab tacos with chipotle sauce and salsa verde and the beef tartar then finished up with a fantastic cheesecake there is little to be said about the first two beyond their fantastic taste and fine presentation but the cheesecake bears mentioning it was delicious among the best cheesecakes ive had certainly and it was served in an unusual fashion in a small jar layered almost like a parfait my dining neighbors and i were both confused by the presentation but we found it charming once we realized there had not in fact been a mistake and as i said it was delicious a nice coffee on the side rounded out the dessert

i enjoyed a few drinks with dinner as well first a strawberry mojito wellcrafted and tasty if not revolutionary not everything needs to be then a simple gin and tonic made with beefeater 24 a very fine gin i was impressed by the garnish which included real juniper berries a first for me i would be interested to know what tonic water they use at barbarossa since i am particular about both parts of my favorite drink suffice to say this one was excellent

the service was initially nothing to write home about the waiters were perhaps slightly on the inattentive side but i was in no hurry so i didnt mind to wait a little longer for them to get around to me eventually a nice waiter from bangladesh more or less took over my table and was far more present providing excellent service we chatted a little bit near the end of my meal and he gave me a glass of patxaran as a digestif on the house he was very interested in hearing about my experience at the restaurant so i got the impression he was involved in the management i dont know if it is limited to him but i observed a desire for excellence for the restaurant and a will to constantly improve it was impressive

i had a pair of wonderful experiences at barbarossa and would certainly go back next time im in shanghai, came across this restaurant whilst we where exploring peoples park there where 3 of us and we ordered 2 set lunches between us one salmon and one burger the food was tremendously good and of a very high standard our waiter jhay was fantastic and gave us excellent service, i have been to this restaurant a few times and i really enjoy the atmosphere and decor the food is good and if you come during daylight you will see the amazing park setting with water lilies and greenery a bit expensive like all western food restaurants but worth a visit, apart from the nice location and ethnic decorations inside barbarossa have many more reasons as definitely need to go place in shanghai
almost many different offers each night happening  the bar great drinks and good value 
as well snacks available should taste the french fries thin and crispy mini burgers and ham crochet are tasty
dhon bar manager always giving best  excellent service, very nice food
beautiful location
good service

its a very good place for couples groups business and friends
on the 2nd floor there is a bar with hookah, the location has such a delightful atmosphere just like the place it self

they have a lovely menu but the lunch offer is a great deal the price depends on the main dish you choose the one on the picture costed 68 rmb besides the main dish you get a soup salad bread a dessert and a cup of coffee or tea

the prices of the drinks cost more than average but this lunch deal makes up for it

the english of the staff was not that great but they are really friendly and helpful, we went there during the day to have lunch since it is really close to peoples square the lunch was really great and cheap with the menu concept however the drinks are between 4060 rmb which is a bit pricey the food was good nothing exceptional the service was rather slow with poor english
the evening we came back to try sisha waterpipe which was a great idea it was quite busy with a lot of people loud music but good atmosphere overall the price for sisha is from 100 to 320 rmb the service was also slow during the night and after midnight the dj started to play house music which clearly did not fit
overall good place to try once, this is definitely one of my favorite places in shanghai the atmosphere is very peaceful and calm it has a nice view lots of tress and a pond around the restaurant the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable as well besides the location is right in the city center so i would totally recommend this place to have lunch or a nice dinner the also have the second floor where they have a nice bar and only serve drinks it opens at 5 pm daily nice lounge five stars, every time i am in shanghai i usually dine at this restaurant the night before my last stay  i love the location ambiance  most especially the food the staff are also nice  friendly im so lucky that i got to take a photo with the chef hehehe hes also friendly too, i came here for lunch and although the service wasnt the best the food was excellent and the location is unbeatable its actually in the park so it would be a great place for a date in the evening although the food was a little expensive it was wellprepared and tasty and they had a good variety of options on their brunch menu, visited on a weekday at lunchtime just passing through the peoples park and happened on the restaurant great views as you eat i had eggs with a twist a tapas meal came with soup salad and a small but great dessert bread and tea or coffee all for 58 rmb  fantastic value definitely recommend, nice restaruant with live music and sport events the atmosphere is good for enjoying a few of their tap german beers food is good the menu has nothing special that
stands out but we tried some pizzas and german sausage and they both were good
it was hard to find the taxi driver had us looking for it for a while would recommend it as a bar too to hang out and have drinks,  in particular  their cocktails  this also made for a truley lovely barrestaurant a little more expensive for drinks than on tong ren lu or mao ming lu however with it being located around peoples square next to the skyscraper that houses the marriot hotel the pricing of food and drink is actually quite reasonable the venue itself is also nicely laid out and decorated and serves as a lovely environment to spend time with friends drinking and eating

i look forward to returning at some point in the near future, having arrived at 5pm the happy hour was just starting off at 50 off cocktails not bottled beer tapas style snacks were tasty
at 7pm i realised i was surrounded by good looking women 
it was ladies night and the drinks were free for them

shisha was really good  as there are not too many options on shanghai i had 2 over the evening

before leaving feeling a little heavy headed at midnight  i realised i had a great evening, ive been frequently drinking at barbarossa during weekends i like its ambiance with chilling music my drinks goes well with their inhouse mini burger if you want to be romantic i suggest you drink with your partner at their rooftop but only available during summer barbarossa is really a nice place look for dhon  the filipino bar manager he will surely help you with the seats and drinks, i have been coming to barbarossa for 6 years now and still find it a great place for bringing tourist who are visiting shanghai for the first time its location nestled into peoples square makes it unique and memorable their service has never been stellar and i dont go there for that but the drinks are generally good and the shisha was fine it seems that the shisha is not what it used to be now using pucks instead of having servers with coals who can tend to your pipe this takes away from the experience and also makes for a sore throat in the morning i find it strange that so many of the nonalcohol options are only available on the first floor so my wife who doesnt drink basically could chose from about 2 or 3 things

parking is ample for anyone driving and its across the street from the jw marriott if you happen to be staying there i did have a bad service experience here the last time i visited i was required to pay a table minimum but waited more than one hour for our first round to arrive meaning that we did not have time to even order our second round to reach the minimum spend i spoke to a manager who fixed it all took away the minspend and comped our first round so overall the feeling when we left was great and i am happy to recommend with full confidence that i will return now that the summer is in full swing, a beautiful oasis in the middle of peoples park and very close to the moma building we came early and one can tell it is a popular spot as all the tables beside the windows overlooking the pond were reserved we managed to persuade the wait staff that we would be out by 7 and they got us a seat by the windows

we ordered the angus steak octopus and pork and the eggplant verdict perfect

the steak was perfectly marbled and was tender and flavourful the octopus was very succulent moist amazing the
eggplant came was a honey mustard dip which hit the spot amazing

barbarossa is a must visit great food
we didnt have any problems with the wait staff they were rather attentive

tip do book early for a window seat it certainly is worth the trip, go there in summer and enjoy the roof top terrace but you have to be lucky to get a good places for this come early and combine it with the happy hour one of my favorite bars in shanghai, after a really long week in china travelling between guangzhou xiamen ningbo myself and the missus arrived in shanghai for our final two days having had this place recommended by a friend we decided to give it a shot as we were looking to let our hair down and have some nice western food and drinks well that is exactly what we got and more it is a really nice cool trendy restaurant  bistro bar located in peoples park when we arrived there the waiter told us there were no seats but we were welcome to sit at the bar and have a drink we drank lovely cold draft imported beer while we waited when we got our seat which according to the waiter was the best one in the house we immediately ordered from a really good menu we both went for the lamb shank and it was mouth watering the meat was cooked to perfection after the food we went upstairs and sat and drank while some funky house music was been played by a dj
the only downfall of the place is when we were heading home the park was in darkness and there was little or few lights to guide us out a bit scary for our liking but thankfully we made our way out safely and hailed a taxi back to our hotel
i would recommend this spot, this place is definitely not to be missed on a visit to shanghai i have been here several times now and it doesnt fail to impress me customer service in the restaurant is faultless and tapas excellent i have not yet enjoyed the upper bar but can highly recommend the restaurant, barbarossa is serenely located in the middle of the peoples park right next to the area where impatient parents advertise their sons or daughters who are 30+ and still left on the shelf the restaurant is beautiful like a huge winter garden and tastefully decorated

since we were not very hungry my wife and i just shared the wagyu burger which came with perfect miniature fries it was delicious even though we got a little worried because the patty was only medium rare and especially my wife is more the welldone type it turned out to be safe which was a good thing because it was our last day in shanghai before our flight back to germany anyway i think they should always ask their guests how they want their burgers done

if you like us usually have only local food when you travel this is the perfect place to make an exception and maybe youll find a local spouse too, a little bit hard to find but very nice place close to the water we where there on a rainy day soo very little people and easy to get a table near the window we had paella and some hot tapas food was good and the staff was very nice this is a place to go to if you like spanish inspired food or just good food, this place is conveniently located in a beautiful garden next to a lake and very close to several hotels visited the place twice one for dinner and one for lunch lunch menu is ok dinner a la carte was better especially the tapas were very good service needs some improvement ask for a table at the window, the paella was bland the waiter was dour and rarely visited the table clearly didnt care if we liked the place or the food go anywhere else, we had lunch right by the window great scenery of the pond and the park it was a lovely lunch defenetly come back, we went there in a sunday  not many people there  but the place is very cozy 
we were very lazy  so we decided to ask the chef to take care of us
we had different dishes  all well balance  explosion of flavors croquettes  burrata salad
the best a beetroot tartar  but i dont remember if it was on the menu ask for that dish  the chef is very nice so probably will be glad to make it 
service was very attentive 
i really wanted to come back during the weekend  probably the atmosphere will be better , perhaps one of the most uniquely decorated restaurants ive been to in shanghai such a cozy atmosphere and very friendly staff ladies night wednesdays great shisha and delish food a must visit for any tourist in shanghai cannot wait to come when the weather gets warmer and see the outdoor deck highly recommended, i came here in the afternoon for some snacks

location  very accesible via metro located inside peoples park

service  very attentive staff food was quickly prepared

food  chorizo iberico was very good sangria lychee was also very goodthe menu is on the expensive side

overall i would come back next time for the paella, i went with my gf and we discovered this cozy and fancy place in the middle of people square we didnt know what to order so we asked the waiter for a suggestion and he recommend us check the food menu in order to pairing our dinner not easy to find in sh then he order some starters for us when suddenly the chef shows up with a special dish burrata and dried tomatoes which was terrific he ask us if we want to keep trying new items and the festival just starts we tried also the callos and the softshell tacos were superb
in general we have a great experience and we are really looking forward to back and try the rest of the menu","bar",0.545470345177556
37,"my first and last time to be here is with my friend kang kang
he told me why he will come to din tai fung restaurant   i questioned him we can have it in taipei which is the original restaurant  why eat in sh   kang kang said  his uk foreigner partners insisted on eating it if not eat in other western restaurant some foreigner will not eat strange things or dare to eat too interesting things which they dont know but if they still hope to have a try of chinese food esp sh famous steamed bao  then din tai fung is the best place
they will trust this place and know what they need to order this is very famous top restaurant in the world and got michelin certified, the restaurant has a strong reputation the food options and quality were very good and the service was timely and punctual

the dumplings plates are a great option but other dishes on the menu looked fabulous based upon observation from surrounding tables

would recommend for those who do want to experience quality chinese food, after eating twice at paradise dynasty in one week and going to din tai fung in the middle helped me to compare the two i would rather dine at paradise dynasty than din tai fung it is good restaurant great dumplings but nothing to beat the variety and taste at paradise dynasty so if you love dumplings give this place a try, ive been here on sunday afternoon for lunch and enjoyed steamed dumplings as well as xiaolongbao with pork shrimps and vegetables they are simply delicious soft an transparent with a very delicate taste service has been very efficient waiting time is about 10 min this is a good quality restaurant, nothing much to review as it taste just same as all the other branches only highlight is i felt this place is less crowded than those other branches in lujiazui area, this chain of restaurants is consistently the same at the various locations

the food is delicious and really well prepared

steamed dumplings and broths are made to perfection actually all their food is made to perfection, my local colleague brought me to this branch of the din tai fung chain prior to a planned evening visit to the nearby shanghai tower i had previousy visited a similar one in taipei  the one in the taipei 101 skyscraper and made famous when tom cruise visited a few years ago sadly there were no international film stars at this branch on the evening i visited

guided by my colleague and the helpful full coloured pictorial menu we made our way through a range of delicacies including steamed shrimp  pork dumplings steamed shrimp and pork shao mai pork filled xiaolaobao stewed spongy gluten kao fu fried pork chop shrimp fried rice with egg to name but a few i washed this all down with local bottled draft tsingtao beer

this is a modern brightly lit restaurant which certainly gives the impression of being part of a successful chain i liked the fact that you can watch the many chefs in their white outfits caps and face masks as they scurry about making all the famous dumpling dishes in the fully open kitchen area

service was professional and friendly here they cater for the many western touristsexpats who were mingling with the locals for a safe easy introduction into this style of chinese food you certainly cant go wrong here in my humble opinion, very nice staff at this location of this very reliable asian chain the food was consistently delicious and only at lunch time 1230pm was it too crowded to get a table, the dumplings are superb

we ordered three x5 dumplings prawn prawn with hairy crab and chicken all delicious

we were very keen to order the fried fish but it had sold out as very popular

we also ordered to share the wonton soup fried rice and prawn with hairy crab all incredibly delicious our food was quite randomly staggered up to 20mins so be aware things might arrive at different times

this restaurant is a chain and is popular with locals and tourists, dtf is the typical restaurant for foreigners  but start to see chinese it is simple clean and the service is at western standard dtf sell xia lampao about 56 times the normal price  it is usually 1 rmb per piece and here it is 68 but the over all remain an affordable restaurant what makes this dtf different from all others is  the view having such a view for dinner and paying only 600 rmb for 4 persons is  the deal of city, dtf a now globally operating chain restaurant offers a range of chinese dishes including their signature xiaolongbao the reason i return again and again to dtf  mostly for lunch  isnt that i believe their xiaolongbao are the best or the range of dishes is the biggest  best rather it is the consistency and quality of the dishes as well as the service which generally doesnt vary much yes its pricier than other chinese restaurants offering similar fare but you pay for the consistency and general quality of the food its a safe place to take out of town visitors and tourists as the menu is pretty straightforward and i havent had any surprises where anyone was disappointed this specific location is quite a bit smaller than the one in the super brands mall and without a view but worth a visit if in the swfc or nearby

note there are not that many tables for larger groups > 5 people as in other locations and this one offers mainly tables for 24 guest plus a couple of booths the spicy shrimp wontons are my favorite and highly recommended, this place is for tourist only yes their dumplings are good but not exceptional  come on if you are ready to spend that much for dumplings you might either be a tourist who just stay one week here or someone who only eat at fancy places just for sharing it after on weibo or weixin, every time i am in shanghai i pay a visit to this restaurant as i loved their dim sum for years  still this last experience was not at the precedent level some dim sum were too dry  service was terrible and too quick you need to eat at light speed and that s not good for digestion the vegetables  though pricey not well cooked  so this time only three stars and hoping that next visit will be as good as the one made in 2015
for te same money you can get better options for sure  as prices are raising continously, when we landed in shanghai our first stop was to go try the famous soup dumplings xiaolungbao din tai fung is a chain restaurant that has a good reputation for soup dumplings they have a variety of soup dumplings we came here for lunch and ordered the pork and crab meat soup dumplings as well as gourd with shrimp soup dumplings the pork and crab meat one was our favorite the skin is thin and packed with flavor inside i just wish it was a little bigger the place was a little pricier then some of the other spots in the area but all in all a good resturant, great place to eat dumplings the menu offers a large variety of dumplings all more delicious than each others the shao mai are terrific
the restaurant area was pleasant and the waiterswaitresses were friendly

in short very good restaurant but the addition could inflates quickly, great spot for soup dumplings with that little extra like truffles all the veggies are very fresh and well prepared and the dumplings are perfection very consistent from location to location as well hope to see more locations in the us, din tai fung is a chain restaurant with good reputation this din tai fung has perfect location as many tourists visit the wold trade center everyday the restaurant is beautifully decorated and well maintained the service we received was great however food was ordinary nothing wrong with the food just not good enough for the price we were paying we expected more flavor and better quality, had dumpling with a colleague and end up with stomach upset yet there is no email address to complain about the crab roe dumpling which was not very fresh, a chinese guide took a group of us to dine first and taught us how to eat dumpling with soup in them since the food was excellent i went back and enjoyed the food very much it was a bit pricy side but it was all worth it nice and clean atmosphere, i wanted to try a din tai fung while here in shanghai as they have a reputation for having some of the best xiaolongbao despite them being a taiwanese restaurant chain
i decided to eat at this particular location for no other reason then i walked past it after going to the top of the world financial centre
the place is very clean and nicely presented and the staff were excellent friendly and good english the menu is a decent size and everything is in english and easy to understand
the food including the xiaolongbao was really good cannot fault it was flavourful and filling and given the location the price although a little on the expensive side was ok
i imagine other locations are a little cheaper as this would get a lot of tourist foot traffic and they are probably paying a higher rent than in other mall locations
but despite everything being good it felt a bit hollow a bit sterile
there wasnt the hustle and bustle associated with other chinese restaurants the atmosphere was very hushed and felt forced
cannot fault the food or service but this only gets an average from me for overall experience maybe ill try a couple of other branches and see how they stack up might just be this location and not the complete din tai fung experience, the restaurant is well located easy to reach with the metro and even if the room is not very huge you can reserve a table
here i had the best dumplings ever there is a huge variety with pork chicken beef crabs vegetables the service is high level and waitress spoke english it is not granted in shanghai
the only weird thing that happened was that we could not split a pot of tea in two because on the menu was indicated for one person if you want to split you should have the bigger pot but if two persons order a beer and a tea and they want to share it is not allowed or at least that night with that waitress we couldnt
by the way i strongly recommend to have dumplings in this or in any of the din tai fung actually i ate in two of them and the quality was the same, my wife and i have eaten at din tai fung several times in seattle so we knew what we were after and the world financial center location did not disappoint they make the best dumplings that we have ever had we also like to enjoy the shrimp and pork wantons in spicy sauce another plus is you can always see the people that are making your food the cooks and the cooking surfaces look incredibly clean, we ate lunch here and it was more than lunch it was an experience we were given ginger strips formed into a tiny tower and the server poured vinegar and soy sauce into the the bowl and explained that we dip them and eat them that was helpful because we would not have known to add the vinegar we had three types of dumplings five each vegetable gourd and shrimp and mushroom they were all great the service was super and it was interesting to watch the dumplings being prepared in the kitchen we would have liked to have eaten here more often while we were in shanghai, the food and choices were great though tended to be on the expensive side for dim sum small plates shanghai food the place is small and a little cramped, ive been to this restaurant more than 10 times in the last 10 months for lunch with the colleagues tasty food good service always good place to start practicing using chopsticks my case if possible avoid the crowd between 12 and 1 pm and go after 1, very nice i dont really like to review about restaurants but this restaurant is really good i went to the same restaurant in taiwan but it was nothing like this time really delicious dumplings and spinach if you visit swfc you should visit here and eat some dumplings, have been to the la store a few times which is easily a 2 hour wait chose this location due to proximity of other sightseeing landmarks this location was very clean great service and food taste great just wish they had more vegetarian options, din tai fung has been operating and famous in mainland china for more than 10 years as far as i know frankly the bum is quite good and juicy but truly overpriced its a chain restaurants and ive tried different ones in bj sh singapore and taiwan bj and sh are the most expensive, the food at this restaurant is truly fantastic they are known for their dumplings and specifically what we call in america soup dumplings because when you bite into them they are filled with a delicious soup in addition to whatever meatseafood veggie is inside the service was great the ambience is very family friendly, having landed in the morning decided to have lunch at this branch of the famed roc chain aside from the famed soup specialty here you can find good quality products cooked in a clean environment and with a delicate taste that helps the foreigners to adapt before trying authentic shanghainese cuisine
the right setting for business meetings having reasonable prices, i had the dumpling xiaolongbao and the spring rolls and they were great very good service most of the staff speaks english highly recommended, amazing dim sums that we come back for all the time the ones with truffles are well worth the expense but most others are also delicious otherwise the menu is excellent with lots of choice and everything is quite tasty but you never really get to it as you fill yourself with dim sums its usually hard to get a table be prepared to wait a bit you wont regret it, we went in the evening about 7 after taking in the view had to wait about 30 minutes for a table enjoyed the xiaolongbao <u+5c0f><u+7b3c><u+5305><u+3002>they were expensive but well made

other dish we liked was the cold chicken in wine sauce attentive service, it was much easy to get a table for dinner and on weekends than busy lunch hour
standard quality food with good service was requested to fill in comment card
disappointedly a few popular dishes were already sold out at 1915
worth going when there is no long queue, great dim sum at din tai fung in shanghai financial district best dim sum ive tried in shanghai black truffle xiaolongbao is really great and to die for a must item in the menu to try id definitely go back again on my next visit to shanghai
highly recommended to anyone and great restaurant for the whole family for get together particularly on sunday lunch, i ate here twice in a week and there was no wait either time worth the trip to pudong  and if youre staying here even better

i had three types of dumplings pork chicken and pork with shark fin the boring ones pork chicken were made that morning and the meat was overworked too compact not juicy enough the pork with shark fin was made to order and absolutely delicious the shark fin didnt add to the experience but the freshness did those were the most expensive dumplings id ever had like $5 usd per dumpling and not the best example of soup dumplings overall

i also had the cucumbers which were really tasty and only slightly spicy

you could easily spend $75$100 usd pp here so choose wisely, i went with my family for lunch today this is a great restaurtant with a lot of dumplings options great food great place, i enjoy dining here firstly because the quality of food is good and service too however the pricing makes it a bit prohibitive for coming too regularly, for the second time this week i had dumplings and wantan soup in din tai fung but this time in shanghai especially the spicy wantan soup which is not really a soup but some kind of dumplings also clearly recommended the staff was very good and the atmoshpere was soft and not pushed great place for a simple dinner, headquartered in taipei this brand has expanded aggressively in the past few years throughout asia and even beyond we got a private room for our business group and though it was small it was cozy we ordered the staples  lots of dumplings pork truffle spicy potstickers fried rice etc they were all very good and i would say the quality is 80 that of the taiwan original good value for money, perfect for dim sum and dinner for smaller groups a place i always return coming to shanghai good service and very high quality, this restaurant is a chain from taiwan is now is ver famous already around asian countries and usa trust me that the food is very delicious and try some of the appetizers which are a great start into the meal definitely a place which should be visited during your shanghai trip regardless which location you end up choosing enjoy, this is a very clean restaurant with english speaking staff who will help you spend money on their incredible food this restaurant would be at home in the expensive part of any us city

i visited here for lunch after spending the morning at the wfc observation deck amazing views weather permitting i wanted dim sum and this place looked quite nice the staff is friendly and very attentive the food is plated beautifully and very tasty the prices were a bit higher than i expected a meal for two was 310y ~$50 i usually spend this at other dim sum places but receive probably 225 times as much food elsewhere the menu is also quite limited compared to a standard full dim sum offering everything was freshly prepared and delivered to the table in stages preventing anything from becoming cold

the soup dumpling selection was the highlight of the trip i also recommend the spicy pork wontons in sauce it was amazing i will bring visitors here who seem less comfortable in a more traditional chinese restaurant, my family and i have actually been here a number of times now too many to count the menu variety is very good and the dumplings and the xiaolongbao is wonderful menu is in english with chef recommendations staff is very helpful and polite and prices are not too high for the quality of the food place is clean location is good and convenient to public transportation if required what more can you ask for give it a try you wont be disappointed, food was good for a chain restaurant but not the best or most authentic we had during our trip the service felt a little hurried, excellent chinese food amazing choice of xiaolongbao good prices nice and helpful staff delicious meals happy to visit it again, din tai fung is always one of my favorites whether is in taiwan china or the us in shanghai even some famous restaurants have strangetasting water  even when it is boiled for tea i did not find it in this restaurant thats a huge plus on top of the simple but great food, just as great as all of them it never disappoints we already have our favourite choices we always order im really sad there is not a dtf in europe it is not cheap but one of the best and safest places to eat in china, after going up the jin mao tower i decided to go across the road to the shanghai world financial center to see what restaurants were there

found din tai fung and read some good reviews on tripadvisor so i thought i would give it a try restaurant is clean and good service

i ordered crab roe  pork xiaolongbao and vegetable  ground pork wonton soup see pics i have to say i have tried dumplings from different restaurants across the world uk hong kong new york and these were some tasty xiaolongbaos the wonton soup was also delicious

i just wish i was with more people so i could order more food and try out other items on their menu, anywhere in china no matter the city you have to try din tai fung the food is superb not to mention the dumplings for which they are famous do not miss","Chinese cuisine",0.429174975147087
38,"calypso is one of the places to experience how the modern locals and expats wine and dine the food is great with nice variety of modern european cuisines during spring and summer there is also an outdoor area where you can sit and people watch, really impressed with the service there were more than 20 of us on the busy night on valentines day having a company dinner we sat at a quiet corner service was great and attentive food was delicious a bit slow when serving our main dish but what can you complain on a busy night it is understandable the steak was soft and juicy and the desert was impressively plated amazed that price was not that expensive reasonable i will definitely be back next time i visit shanghai, we came here for a dinner when most restaurants were closed due to chinese new year reservation highly recommended
the service was outstanding friendly and professional
we had some specialities  not just the normal pizza and spaghetti dishes  and were highly satisfied
and all wasnt overpriced at all
was a really nice repeatable dinner and evening, i was recommended this place for the tea time service and it was kind of a disappointment

the tea and the pastries are just average and the service is also not particularly good, mediterranean styled food with a reasonable price point for a hotel restaurant

recommend going upstairs to have pizzas and drinks as they open the roof during good weather, great food gelato ice cream was the highlight on hindsight we should have ordered pizza which they are famous for

the staff were attentive and courteous

$$$$, had lunch there during peak hours but it was not crowded at all of course its high price is one of the reasons love this spacious and modern design spent two to three hours there for a relaxing lunch pizza is fantastic the cheese and tomato make it irresistible coffee pasta and dessert are all great we ordered the scallops appetiser but the scallops are just normal and small in size but it is more expensive than the pizza would rather have another pizza, we have had again an excellent italian lunch at calypso thanks to chef luciano farinelli
pastas and risotto are wonderful and pizzas are from far the best in town
also very good choice of other fine italian dishes with meat or fish and desserts we have not yet tested all so it will make us come back several times more
wine list offers a good selection of affordable bottles from italy and other countries
a place for fans of italian good food, ive been to bella napoli mercato da marco la strada and a few other italian restaurants in shanghai and the quality of the pizza here was far superior to any of the others ive tried in this city
i would not recommend the saffron risotto or scallops but i think the food overall is pretty decent for shanghai standards, came here for a work function and will most definitely be back ground floor has outdoor terrace but by far the best part of this place is the amazing roof terrace where the roof slides back staff were lovely and the space is well designed, went there last night for their michelin star dinner
dinner was very good foods i would never normally see let alone eat
quality was excellent price 888rmb per person ive spent less for better food and more for worse food so no complaints went to try the experience
id go back for the michelin dinner again i may visit the restaurant during normal hours just to try their house foods, ideally located next to the hotel i always stay in shanghai actually part of the same property i went there last week after few bites i had already at the shangri la horizon lounge so i was not that hungry i sit outside and ordered a pizza with beer pizza was ok and mood of the place actually really cool i will be back for a full meal asap, i came here for drinks on a friday night in september perfect weather sitting outdoors on the 2nd floor musicdj spinning great vocals hip vibe not too crowded the world is good

have to flag down a server to get a drink but very pleasant interaction once you do go here before the weather gets too cold and they close the roof, had dinner here tonight and while fairly good thought very over priced for the quantity of food served portions very small and surprisingly for the main courses there were no side dishes on the menu hope you are not too hungry when you come here, in the centre of jingan are good location a beautiful glass building less of guests private and bright view food quality still remains to improve, i went in this place several time and every time the food and the service were excellent 
i like a lot the fish soup and the main courses with the fish
they have a good wines selection 
the presentation is perfect and the sweet amazing
i liked the location  the terrace is perfect for every saison, great italian style food very tasty service a little slow at times nothing major had to ask for sparkling water twice thats all reasonable price tag sat outside over looking the water feature nice relaxed atmosphere, stayed at the shangrila jing an last month one evening i decided to go for drinks and notice the calypso offers a buy 1 free 1 during happy hour

atmosphere on the upper level was fantastic so relaxing the roof can be retracted to allow fresh air and light in

i sat at the bar and service was prompt, food is not bad but the portions can be quite small pizzas are great good for business lunchesdinners open kitchen concept allows you to see most of the kitchen work they have a great terrace on the 2nd floor that is good for after work drinks they do open the shades when the weather is good, such a good open space to have drinks with friends or even business talk at the night plenty of choices of drinks, my mother came to visit me in china during the dragon boat festival long weekend and i decided to take her to calypso for lunch based on the good reviews we were both looking forward to this meal however we had a terrible experience at this restaurant

we loved the building and the decor for our main course we ordered the seafood paella with lobster which was one of the restaurants recommendations on the menu the dish came with half a lobster when i cracked open the lobster claw i found that it was completely uncooked i immediately informed the waitress and instead of taking the whole dish away she grabbed an empty plate and asked me to hand over the uncooked claw which had already been broken into pieces minutes later the waitress came back and told us that the chef would make a new order for us my mother kindly asked the waitress to prepare the lobster only without the rest of the dish as we were both full and did not want to waste any food the waitress double checked with us to make sure that we only wanted the lobster but not the entire seafood paella

when the waitress finally came back to our table to our surprise she brought back the broken claw that i handed to her earlier it was not even the entire claw she put that piece of claw back on my dirty plate and told us apologetically that she thought the chef would make a new dish for us my mom and i were both speechless for a second we asked to speak with the manager since the poor waitress though polite and sweet obviously lacked professional training or any decision making power minutes later the waitress came back again to tell us that the manager asked her to tell us that the manager believed that it would take too long to make us a new lobster and offered us a free dessert instead also the manager could not come to our table because heshe was busy at this point our good mood was completely spoiled we simply grabbed the bill and left

i believe for the price we paid we were entitled to a meal that was at least safe to eat this was definitely not the level of service or food i would expect at a shangrila restaurant i am sorry about this lengthly review i hope that you would never experience the same horrible experience at this restaurant as we did i will not be returning and i strongly recommend you to go somewhere else for food that is worth its price and for service that is less humiliating, ok  if you wanna be seen and love to pose  go 
pretty nice building like an modernized glasshouse cum  barn design
drinks are expensive you have been warned, cannot find more adjectives to describe the fantastic pizza creation by maestro pizzaiolo luciano he simply delighted us again and again with a fantastic pizza with fresh buffalo mozzarella parma ham and fresh pachino cherry tomatoes and an expected wonderful surprise come to our mouth at the last bitethe crust was filled in with fresh made ricotta cheese simply sublime
after that great start the an excellent fish paella and a great fresh mixed fish huge plate completed an unforgettable moment with friends
a great note to the service the elegant and refined image of the staff together with their attention grace and care to customers make calypso one of my few preferred venues in shanghai, 562016  we were attracted to the outdoor dining patio but had to move inside when the temperature dropped the decor was very trendy and hip as i would have expected in los angeles it definitely attracted a young and fashionable crowd i ordered a risotto with mushroom and foie gras it was very delicious my daughter did not like her order i forgot what she had we also ordered churro with chocolate sauce for dessert it came with 12 pieces more than we could eat we finished with chamomile tea and espresso the tea was about us$8 and the espresso was about $10 services were good

i didnt know until just now that it was actually part of the shangri la hotel where we stayed, great food risotto pasta pizza everything is excellent desserts are good too nice service and environment open kitchen with a wonderful view, each time i come here the food somehow gets better

last night we had spaghetti cabanora lamb chops and a frittata to share the food tasted amazing the service was a bit unorganized but when we got the right persons attention their service was quite prompt the food arrived precisely on time the wine selection a decent and not over the top expensive we enjoyed a pinot from new zealand we shared the chocolate ice cream delight yes it was a delight

the facility is large rectangular building with high ceiling and a long single chamber of seats i can tell they are trying to make it warmer and less noisy but they need to work harder if you come around 6pm the place looks and feels cold when you arrive around 9pm its a bit too noisy

i like the tables along the window with a decent view of the kerry center courtyard and shangrila hotel, if you are staying in shangrila jing an or around this area do try this restaurant but personally i still prefer 1515 west chophouse  bar which is still under shangrila the service is ok but the sitting is terrible as the tables are too closed with each other it would be funny if they sit you next to the bar as the waiting staff will keep passing through the tiny space between the tables my recommendation is not to sitting next to the bar there is two bar counters the managers never come around and talk to the customers even though there are so many of them very typical example of service in shanghai and i can notice there is a caucasian lady walking around but never have any interaction with customers not the typical shangrila service as i know the food presentation are not great as well , all six of us enjoyed the service and the food the carpaccio was like butter and i enjoyed the gazpacho the only downside was that my pan fried gnocchi with veg was a bit dry i would recommend it though as all the others enjoyed their meals, the restaurant is nice and cosy you can see the kitchen which is an interesting concept the food is tasty and the service fast the chefs are all italians which guarantee you the quality of the food, i wasnt disappointed at all i went with low expectatives about the place after read some reviews but anyways i wanna try i should say that the service was attentive and professional i will specially recommend the pizzas so we should put this restaurant in the trattoria category more than italian fine dining was a very easygoing dinner experience that make you relax i will recommend to try out this place, there were six of us for dinner and if it wasnt for my very dry pan fried gnocchi i would give this place an excellent rating the rest of my family was very happy with their meals the carpaccio was like butter and the gazpacho was among the best ive tasted the staff was attentive but not overbearing would definitely go back, atmosphere in calypso are very nice and they got the best pizza in town waiters are so friendly they explains each dishes for me and also answer many questions i asked our family having a very nice dinner and will be come back soon, address of the restaurant was a bit misleading as it was actually located in the inner street on the piazza in between the jingan kerry centre and shangrila hotel rather than yan an road as a first timer it took me quite a while to figure out its whereabout with the help of google maps

it was a nice independent building next to the jingan shangrila hotel with a big signage at the entrance it was lunch time and the place was full and a little bit crowded but i was not noisy due to the very high ceiling and rather polite clientele

service was adequate given it was peak hour wait staff spoke good english and was incredibly patient to let me go through the menu and helped explains one of the dishes cuisine was southern italian with an international asian fusion twist i went for antipasto
misto and pasta carbonara while my friend had crudo and risotto nice dishes of good quality and smaller portion than average saw the stone oven through the semi open kitchen but had not tried their renowned pizza and probably would do it the next time

overall a good business lunch with nice ambiance good food and efficient services, the pizza is fantastic as well as any kind of dish you may choose service is not at the same level of the restaurant waiters often forget to bring drinks and do not take care well of the guests atmosphere is very good and nice, since the chef pizzaiolo luciano farinelli joined the fabulous team of calypso you can really enjoy the best pizza in town after 10 year living in asia now i can finally enjoy the real pizza napoletana genuine imported italian ingredients flavor treated for 72 hours wonderful fresh mozzarella san marzano tomatoes that chef luciano directly from naples city prepares openly in front of you using a stoned oven imported from naples what can have more run ro try, it was slightly overrated but food is very good while service is so so seems to have some staffing issue where there was some difficulties in pinning down waiterswaitresses sometimes but the decor is nice and good for friends gathering and also good choice for after dinner drinks, we had heard about the new spanish chef of calypso and the new menue he had brought with him the lunch experience was very good we had the seafood paella made with rice imported from spain and it was really like being in spain also the atmosphere was good the open kitchen allowed us to watch the cooks at work congratulations, i have been at calypso several times in the last 2 years  always had wonderful food flawless service delivery by the manager leon and his staff the ambiance is great full of energy and the drinks are fantastic  the kitchen is running by a new chef from spain and he is making delicious dishes i will be back soon , i love this place with an amazing architecture i used to go there since a long time and since few month a new chef took over its even better than before the food is really is delicious like the wine but one thing i love there is the service very welcoming and always watching if you need anything i definitely recommend this place also great to grab a drink on the second floor, ive been to calypso few weeks ago was sitting outside with a glass of house wine to refresh my mind after a long day when i almost finish my wine i decided to have dinner here because of nice ambiance

i order some beef with mash potato as my main course and really love the taste if i had a company i would have tried their seafood dish too not only the food but also the service is excellent and professional in calypso the lady yvonne was greeting me with hospitality and amazing smile, i really loved the atmosphere and architecture however this was the only thing i liked the staff ignored our table and so making us ask them to clear the table multiple times some members also did not speak english sufficiently and so not allowing us to ask for specials or vegetarian options the bread on the table had gone stale by the time we sat down and the food in general did not live up to the mediterranean cuisine the restaurant says they have, visited this place a few times this year service is getting worse and so is food quality hope the management improves it, as we were tired after our long flight from europe we came here for lunch after checking into the jing an shangrila next door

used to good simple italian food in italy i found the offerings here disappointing they have tried to reinterpret italian cuisine and failed miserably

give me a good chinese restaurant any day, what should be a flagship outlet of the jing an shangri la with al fresco dining in the beautiful piazza around the mao space already feels tired and needs a good shake a lunchtime visit on one of shanghais most invigorating days of early autumn produced a disappointing experience with a dogeared menu very average starter salads and rubberised calamari from a chef who clearly needs to be taught how to make a decent batter and fry with oil at the right temperature a glass of sauvignon blanc was deficient in both quality and quantity and although the set lunch desserts were better this a restaurant which is coasting on its location laurels and needs to improve a lot to reach the high standards of jing an shangs excellent tsuru 1515 and summer palace, we had dinner with a group of friends and colleagues and the meal we had was outstanding the quality of food was probably the best mediterranean food i had in the whole asia the pizzas were out of this world and the service was excellent as well looking forward to come back some days soon, jing an is a new spot to hang out in shanghai  as an italian person i can recognize a good pizza  the food is delicious and the staff is amazing as well  italian or not italian go and have dinner at calypso  amazzzzzing, just cant miss it modern as jingan area such a modern house suddenly appeared felt so relax when ure having food there especially when u discover theres a even nice bar upstairs really enjoy my night there valuable food and nice drink, foie gras terrine is pretty decent not listed on their menu love their hokkaido scallops starter  mushroom risotto friendly service staff, we went with four for lunch en we went all for the set lunch menus this choice did not disappoint us at all very satisfied friendly staff and nice service, my friend took me for lunch here in my visit to shanghai and it was a wonderful experience the place is very comfortable and with a good decoration walls are all glass which adds to the experience we sat on the outside terrace on a warm sunny day and we had a great meal having some appetizers and cheese for starters and a tasty red wine i order a steak tartare which was aboslutely delicious i barely eat meat since i came to china but i couldnt miss this chance and the pizza was delicate and with a homemade italian taste
i liked it so much that i went back for dinner this time we sat inside and the atmosphere was perfect

39,"sunday champagne brunch at vue hyatt on the bund is the famous and prime choice in shanghai made an reservation 2 weeks before heading to shanghai and arrived the restaurant on time however due to operating negligence our reservation didn�t show up manager helped us to sort out the issue and served us some champagne while waiting

after 30 mins we finally stepped into the restaurant manager ben was so kindly to show us around and introduced all the gourmets in each station we started with seafood station the crab shrimp and oysters were fresh and yummy the ham olives and other dishes are able to make platters to share with friends steak are so juicy and tender the portion weren�t too big and be able to try most of every dishes plus ur glass is never empty

overall my friend and i enjoyed our first brunch experience in vue and will definitely come back to visit again later this year

big thanks to manager benjamin to make our brunch turned out for the best the price is not cheap but worth every penny, the food was delectable  the ambience perfect w d stunning night view of the oriental pearl tv tower in d backdrop  the rest of d skyline it was nice have the chef prepare dinner right before me lobster soup  king prawns it was definitely worth making a trip down to have dinner here during my short transit in shanghai, no doubt of that best choice for a sunday brunch went there again with couple of friends and they love it what else we can complain facing to the best view while drinking a glass of champagne thats exactly what to do on a lovely sunday the service is great as always very friendly and helpful will definitely come back again, clearly the best place in town for having a high quality brunch with a breathless view on pudong and puxi product and meal proposed are really fantastic with a very acceptable price i went there several times and will go again as soon as i can , i dare you to name as good a culinary experience in this part of china you heard me yes the sunday brunch is fabulous pace yourself  take plenty of time ive yet to come close evening supper is like stopping in at the village inn warm friendly familiar best staff ever best host ever best chef ever ever, this was a positive surprise my general view is that sunday brunches are a bit vulgare do not fit into this one it is stylish and of high quality not overwhelming giving you the feeling this just too much instead it gives you a sophisticated lunch of 6 stations and a lot of champagne could honestly be recommended, i thought it was not possible but the team of vue did it make you feel like youre in a luxury hotel in france while in the heart of shanghai
the food is amazing just like you were in paris so fresh and everything cooked on demand you can taste the difference thanks to the quality of ingredients and the technique of the chef the view is the best view of the bund to me the service is perfect and the decoration is the right balance between chic and cosy youll feel at home in a second beside if you have the chance to meet benjamin hell give you a tour of the different cooking workshops available in the room while explaining you the techniques and the origin of the ingredients which will make you want to taste everything and the good news is you can taste everything
benjamin and the chef will make you feel more than welcome and at ease which is quite rare in luxury hotels
in a word vue is not a typical sunday brunch its an experience and the free flow champagne perrier jouet will make it even more enjoyable book in advance if you want to try it especially to have a table near the windows if you try it once i bet you will come back , high standard of service and food  very good champagne and wines  best quality price in shanghai  the staff are well trained by benjamin in floor and benjamin in kitchen  the quality of the food are amazing thanks for this wonderful time , we had just today brunch at the vue restaurant thanks to restaurant manager he arranged a table by the window lobster oysters and too much bubbles
will repeat it again this is second time 2 times great experiences, really nice view and no doubt the best brunch in shanghai try to get one of the tables by the window and indulge yourself with their selected oysters crayfish and crab claws with a flow of perrier jouet amazing experience, first a focus on the manager benjamin the guy is full of attention professional and in the end he knows perfectly the job he definitely applied for the western europe standards less common in asia with a fresh friendly attitude

then the view is excellent because you have at least a glimpse of the bund at every table i think and this is not the case in some places of the top 5 of trip advisor and yes we did one of them not so many tables also so the mood is quiet good

food was great for starters and wine selection with the help of benjamin
risotto was just ok if you look at it with your western standards

finally service small mistakes as they bring us starters at the same time with main course but in the same time they accepted us just one hour before end of service

bill yes expensive but once again cheaper compared to some address of top 5

last thing to answer some comments dont see any dress code as we landed the same day we event went there with hoodies if we had more time we would have made some efforts though but definitely no suits are required

would visit again, my goto champagne brunch in shanghai everything about it is exceptional the view over pudong the intimacy of the venue the professionalism of the staff the quality and range of food and the constant refills of champagne wine soft drinks and bloody marys i have tried other brunches and none compare as of yet yes it is expensive works out at around 800 rmb a head after service charge but i feel that it is well worth it truly superb booking is essential, the atmosphere in this restaurant gives me the feeling as being home  the furniture and interior design gives you simple this feeling the seating is outlined generous spacious so that you have these private living room atmosphere and all the privacy you need so feeling home but have spectacular view off the skyline and the bund of shanghai paired with perfect food the service is perfect and seems to be able to read your mind

if you look for a relaxing dinner with friends or a romantic place this is the place to go, came here for the sunday champagne brunch for a going away brunch arrived there at 1130 just as it opened and were escorted to our table where they poured us champagne and water obviously need to stay hydrated in addition the chef walked out and we werent sure how to approach the brunch and what to go with first and he was great in providing us with how he would eat the food from brunch station to brunch station the food was absolutely incredible and the service was just as impeccable benjamin took great care of our group and they were very accommodating to our entire party, be sure to book a table at the window  this is an absolutely place to go if you visit shanghai for the first time  the view is impressive
food at the start was a little disapointing  as the onion soup was too salted  and for the mushroom soup  i can not complain but i expected better
my girlfriend ordered the rib eye steak  it was a very generous and delicious portion
i ordered the cod  that was tasty  but no wow effect and on the small size  not sure about the carrots it came with
for desert an absolute must  the fruit flambe
not cheap  you pay for the view  i was expecting better food
i must not be the only one  the restaurant was not full on a saturday night in shaghai, the service was impeccable starting with an introduction to vue by the manager benjamin s our first time here the wait staff was very attentive and the chefs at each station prepared eat plate to order
the attention to detail in the preparation of the food is quite evident with every bite chef benjamin has put together an excellent assortment and every dish we tried seemed better than the last there was not a single disappointment during the entire meal
i will soon come back for the food alone but the scenery from the 30th floor of the hyatt is an added bonus, went for sunday brunchtough reservation and justifiably so food choices are quite limited but everything is excellent top ingredients include lobster iberico ham and tiger prawns free flow champagne a bonus, great view of lujiazui shanghai financial district and the bund area and all the way west to jingan hot tub and day beds on rooftop be warned the drinks are awful and expensive stick to wine  beer, highend food with french flair and great service from restaurant manager enjoyed the seafood ravioli and caviar among many other dishes i had this week over multiple dinners several dishes such as the risotto and flambe fruit dessert were cooked right next to me on the granitetop tableside booths the live cooking and great view makes vue restaurant a superb venue for special occasions, service was excellent
food is continental european food of good quality but the wow effect is missing presentation is not up to today international standard
table setting with out table cloth is for a restaurant of this quality and price label shabby, the relaxed athmosphere combined with the extraordinary view of the bund area makes you immediately feel excited needless to say that the food is excellent and thanks to benjamin and the wole team your food dreams come true new twist and beloved brunch clasics makes this brunch a delight you want to return to, ok we struck a sunday which was a working day in shanghai so vue was a little on the quiet side  to our delight i have been to lots of sunday champagne brunches but this totally stands out as being different the venue is spread out and is set out like a house so you have different rooms we were seated in the lounge room the view over the bund and pudong area was fabulous and gave us a different perspective
we were taken on a tour by the manager to each of the food stations and were explained that the idea is to try little bits at each station so you can try everything on offer well i like that concept and the food itself was simply amazing one of the standouts was the lobster bisque  the best i have tasted in a very long time oh also we started with a egg benedict with caviar  again  drooling just thinking about it
the free flow champagne was perrier jouet the service was incredibly attentive and we had quite a few conversations with the head chef only because it was a quieter day overall a fabulous tasting of food and wine in a simply perfect setting would definitely go back yes it is on the higher price side of the champagne brunches but well worth it, i know thats its pricey but really it deserves it fantastic tastes each food station is unique and the service is truly 5 star for sure it is one of the best choice got fine sunday branch dont forget to try the risoto and the very fresh oysters
well done vue, sunday brunch wonderful warm welcome right from the beginning thank you to benjamin and benjamin and all the professional staff who all did hyatt proud the restaurant layout ensures everyone gets a view from the 30th floor windows 6 food stations each with world class fresh food from caviar and lobster  amazing king prawns too wagyu too the best beef tartare in shanghai  champaign is never left un attended

great concept highly recommend to all, we went to this restaurant for brunch with friends who were visiting us in shanghai we really like the concept which is very different from conventional buffets of different stations cooking small portions that you can order and they make it right in front of you beautiful view and the service is impeccable the chef is so friendly and attentive he even walked us to the elevator at the end of the meal, sunday brunch is excellent this brunch has a great view and high quality food the free flow champagne is perrierjouet there are 6 stations with some of the highlights as beef tartare eggs benedict with caviar order this when you sit down oysters chilled lobster and prawns sea bass smoked wagyu lamb shanks a dessert table and fresh bloody marys the executive chef benjamin does a wonderful job with his staff and sourcing the highest quality of ingredients benjamin the assistant manager does an excellent job with the guest and his staff cannot wait to go back, we ate here twice on both occasions we were lucky enough to be at the front of the restaurant with the stunning views of the iconic shanghai skyline very attentive staff food and wine good but a little pricey but i suppose you have to pay for that view, we had an excellent meal in the vue restaurant the views alone are worth a visit but the food and service were also exceptional, we typically come here when we have something to celebrate this sunday we were at the vue restaurant to celebrate my daughters 25th birthday we got the best table in the restaurant directly on the window with a fabulous view over the bund reservation needed well ahead of time
the taste of the food was great like always and especially to mention our host philipp stieger who organizes the service time in perfect way and really made us feel like home
so
 location perfect
 food perfect
 service absolutely perfect, our group decided we needed some western style food after a week in shanghai this place is amazing we had a variety of steaks i had the wagyu filet it was succulent tender flavorful expertly prepared we had whipped potatoes asparagus spinach another in our group had risotto and to top it off  chocolate souffle everything was simply amazing service was superb the space is beautiful with wonderful views of the bund and pudong i highly recommend this restaurant, we went there for a business dinner party of 8 persons we had a nice table close to the window with a view across the river to the illuminated pudong towers which is always nice i began allright but after the starters the desaster began some of us ordered an intermediate course like pasta or soup it did not arrive and we did not ask at that point instead they started to prepare the main course some had fish some had steak and served the plain main course so we had the fish or steak on the table without any of our side orders we began to eat as we didnt want it cold then those who ordered an intermediate course got that served while we already were half way through our plain main course one of us complained but there were just unprofessional excuses we asked for the manager still only worried looks and no clue how to improve the situation meanwhile the side orders came out of the kitchen and by the time they arrived on our table we had our steak or fish completely eaten up in a restaurant that charges 560 rmb for a 300g ribeye steak this is absolutely inacceptable i mean they are within a 5star hotel building we will never go back and warn everybody to go there
the taste of the food was very good though, theres a lot of competition in shanghai but memorable for brunch is only vue of course the view over the bund is spectacular book a front table overlooking it  but if you are a real foodie you wont even want to look outside you are going to be busy eating and admiring the spread laid on

while it may seem pricey it is excellent value for the superb food they serve, i had escargots for apetizer lamb rack for main course and crepes suzette for desert

the escargots was as they should be i loved the lamb rack and crepes suzette

it is perfectly possible to eat here alone the ambiance is so easy going with a woman on board you will find it easy to talk here

the bread could be changed in my opinion escargots is fundamentally improved by good bread but it is so diffucult to find truly good bread in the far east anyway so relatively speaking the bread here is still good

the view is spectacular too, another hotel restaurant that relies on its view which is the most terrific in shanghai but service quality of drinks and food is not above average while they are charging at premium levels the bartenders lost their controls when they are busy and act rudely to customers, view from vue restaurant is exceeding any expectation foods were ok it may be somewhat expensive if only considering the foods however if you sit next to the window table the view of shanghai from 30th floor will make up the high price

service is too good you dont have to do anything except eating and enjoying, we went there for drinks and a small bite on a sunday night and it was just the perfect way to end the week end nice crowd friendly staff amazing view good food what else could you wish for
now very much looking forward to my next visit, i was there with a friend after dinner it costs 100 yuan and you have a free drink very nice view and music ti was a pity to be here without our girls, just went for a drink the view is fabulous service was good and it is a nice and comfortable lounge enjoy the great view, only had a chance to enjoy lunch on this trip very enjoyable and very tasty views are incredible service outstanding, superb and innovative take on sunday bubbly brunch manager philipp and his team do a brilliant job of serving up some of the best food and wine you will find in shanghai if not all of china i love the inrestaurant cooking stations making great dishes to orderlobster soup champagne and parmesan risotto veal tenderloin thai curried prawns caesar salad plus some fabulous desserts also help yourself antipasti platter including cheeses champagne flows very freely for nearly 4 hours excellent quality chablis and pinot noir hand made cocktails 4 beers and unlimited mineral water having lived and worked all over asia for the past 19 years i can honestly say this restaurant is right up there with the best, the vue restaurant perched high up on<u+3010>hyatt on the bund<u+3011>has an amazing view whether it is day or night time when our dinner set arrived the structuring instantly reminded me of hugos in hk with a caesar salad tossed in front of the customers the lobster bisque which tastes similar to hugos too what set it apart was the cabernet wood smoked wagyu beef which was just utterly amazing that fragrance is so fruity yet moist smoky no apple or lychee wood mesquite hickory or bichotan charcoal will give you the same experience thinking about it makes my mouth waters and the expected crepe suzette finish prepared a la minute was expectedly good it better be after that amazing steak experience, had lunch on the 30th floor food was amazing service was impeccable view of the bund was breathtaking, nice view and good selection food more mediterranean style service is nice and warm with good consideration of the client, this is the place if you feel like hanging out with friends with magnificent view of the bund business was extremely well in this bar so if you are looking for crowded places you will find yourself here without a doubt, one of the best view good to mingle good choices for drinks live dj with good music also rooftop level is really cool, probably the best quality food you can get in the whole of shanghai with spectacular views over both sides of the river

most restaurants along the bund offer only views over the pudong skyline that means you are missing out on the beautiful old architecture of the bund due to its location in the river bend this restaurant offers views over both sides and a small balcony to slip out onto and make spectacular photos

the small size and spacious design also mean that you never feel crowded in service is unusually excellent  standards one would expect in the west

the brunch while expensive is by far and away the best in the whole of shanghai china it is a unique experience and worth every rmb for dinner try the chateaux briand or keep an eye open for the many foodie events throughout the year, vue is a well run restaurant in a rather expensive hotel

service need to be tuned up but ok looked over this considering the quality of food served view is an added bonus, everything is on the title
the food is simple but very nice made the restaurant is well decorated with an amazing view on shanghai
the service is great we will come back, it was the second time i visited the vue restaurant and the first time is not satisfied however this time is was excellent
the food was fantastic the service was great and we had a table with amazing view we all were impressed by our second experience and i have to say everything was perfect
now i would highly recommend this restaurant, vue restaurant in hyatt on the bund delivers the most memorable evening in a fine dining environment with a superb view over shanghai millions of lights sparkle over the huangpu river both in pudongs financial district modern shanghai skyline and on the famous bund with its colonial buildings  just like the millions of bubbles in the dom perignon champagne flute
executive chef dieter is a magician of culinary delights which he personally cooks right next to your table dont miss the fantastic crepes suzettes which he prepares with grand marnier flambe melting the home made vanilla ice cream lovely over the fresh berries

4,"we went early as we were booked in for 9pmbooking advised
we were looked aftereven though it was full
it is not a large restaurantbut pleasant and interesting
the food was fantasticmy wife had the best beef lasagne and i had a delicious spicy pizza
at the end a complimentary drink and petit fors
service was friendly particularly elisashe is the pretty italian young lady and sam who took all of our ribbing and jokes
a really good night we felt we made friends with a great teamthorougly recommended, wow what can i say for a person who has a food allergygluten free finding somewhere in shanghai to dine out other than at a hotel is like finding a needle in a haystack

was so reassuring stumbling across this place thanks to trip advisor and being able to dine out with confidence

a quaint little restaurant alongside the bund it offers great food and a lovely ambience

highly recommend for those with gluten free coeliac allergies

service was fantastic wine selection was good and food was delicious, we got in at the last minute sitting in the high tables in the middle which worked just fine  we shared a grilled calamari appetizer which was good  my wife ordered lasagna and i ordered the stracci  my wife loved the lasagna and the stracci was wonderful  were had a nice bottle of wine to accompany a perfect dinner for our last night in shanghai we had some complimentary cookies and limoncello  i would highly recommend you try goodfellas if you are in shanghai , the hotel is a short walk from the westin bund hotel and close to the bund i arrived around 6 pm without a reservation and was quickly seated towards the back service was fast and friendly i was served a bruschetta and 3 types of bread with olive oil

the shrimp and asparagus risotto was tasty and enough for one person the house white wine was decent

after dinner i was served two small complimentary sweets and sambucca with coffee beans

reasonable price, cozy and comfortable restaurant in a very convenient location food was very good but the host lucca was incredible very friendly with good recommendations for the menu and the city he gave more than is expected answering food questions i had and giving me on the house a sample to try and learn more about italian cuisine, this is another one of mine go to places
i have had lunch and dinner several times and have never disappointed
you have to book in advance my previous visits have been weekends and very busy
marco and luca are very warmly welcoming guests and make you feel if you were at home  all the staffs and service are very good and professional as well
always a special place to visit
nesli, stopped into goodfellas for dinner last night but no seats available owner marcos came right up and offered us a table at their upstairs terrace personally walked us upstairs to our table server spoke pretty good english and was able to offer great food appetizer and wine suggestions good food and great service go a long way i would recommend this restaurant to anyone in shanghai well be back before we leave definitely call for reservations, its an ok place but certainly not exceptional food for the price
calamari tough lasagna over spiced ravioli bland with rather hard pasta worth the money we think not would we go again afraid not, i came here with my husband on my birthday and its been one of my favorite dining experiences to date the space is cozy and intimate without being pretentious children are welcome the management and chef are italian which is evident by the friendly service and the amazing food that comes out of the kitchen the eggplant appetizer was perfect for is to share we had two round sofnftrshly baked bread and our pastas were rich and decadent complementary lemoncello was offered after dinner and the owner or maybe manager put on happy birthday by stevie wonder and brought me a slice of tiramisu i am excited to go back with friends who are coming to visit and to try their rooftop bar i have since deleted the food pictures but as you can see they pour healthy glasses of wine, a definite must when visiting shanghai we had the best service best food and we all loved the atmosphere we were treated like stars the food hot and fresh from the kitchen and marco the owner came to check on us and socialize with us for awhile my favorite was the tiramisu i must say that it happens to be the best ive tasted along with the homemade limoncello and manderincello that the chef makes after dinner go on up stairs to the beautiful roof top deck and have your after dinner drinks looking out at the beautiful lights of shanghai and if your lucky to be accompanied by the owner who is eye candy for the ladies then you had a brilliant night, on my recent trip to shanghai for business i decided to give goodfellas a try i must say i was blown away compared to my expectations i figured that italian food in china would be average at best this place rivaled great italian eateries that i have frequented in new york or chicago

the food is amazing and the atmosphere is incredible when you walk in you can just fell the vibe and spirt of this italian restaurant the dull roar of the crowd  the jazz in the background and the low light set the mood the pictures on the wall and view of the bund are second to none this is a perfect place for a date or a spot to hang with your bestie

besides the fabulous food at this jin joint you can expect to find the best service i have ever experienced in shanghai the staff is so friendly and inviting with arms opened wide i was impressed with how they can remember my name on only my second visit and how the owner marco will float around socializing with guests they truly make you feel like family when you walk in and you never want to leave

when you visit i recommend you try the ravioli or the stracci for your main course not to be out done when it comes to dessert you cant go wrong with the selections here at all i love how the staff will bring you some complimentary limoncello with italian cookies that are to die for

i would suggest the tiramisu for your first visit the dessert is one of the best i have had in awhile

i will definitely be back to visit on my next trip as this place had earned my business for life, amazing place
friendly people and 100  recommended when visiting the city and european food is requested, on our last night in shanghai my husband and i treated ourselves to an italian fare
we were not disappointed situated off the historic bund this upbeat restaurant is a perfect restaurant for couples or friends meeting for drinks and dinner we had the pear walnut salad and tomato gnocchi both were delicious the staff is very attentive the retro decor is conducive to an excellent relaxed atmosphere would highly recommend, i was visiting shanghai and a few of my friends who live there recommended this place for dinner at first i thought italian food while in china but wow was i not disappointed

the menu choice is vast and the wine was excellent we had some starters to share which included salads and carpaccio all of which were great

for main my friend had ravioli which looks and smelled amazing and stuck to a ragout dish which was pretty special also

we finished with a chance meeting with the owner who was hilarious and some drinks in their rooftop bar upstairs

definitely dont give this restaurant a miss if youre there, nice intimate atmosphere inside good and friendly service food was delicious its on the mid to expensive range but value was about right might be best to book in advance, such an unassuming front opening into a tiny restaurant that has the most amazing atmosphere there is a real buzz and not an empty seat in the house the staff were excellent and you were never rushed even though the place was rammed full
the food was truly out of this world beautifully presented and perfectly cooked there is something for everyone here and i cant recommend it highly enough you must try it, im from the usa and ive had my fair share of lasagna  but this was the best lasagna ive ever had , very welcoming luca and his assistant were very helpful the food was excellent we were brought a small selection of breads olives as soon as we sat down which was great because we were starving after a 14 hr journey from sydney
i would highly recommend the seafood risotto, we have been in shanghai for 5 days and we have ended up at goodfellas twice a friend said their pizza was the best they had have ever had the fresh bread which is given free of charge at the beginning of the meal is amazing it is a little on the pricey side given that its pizza and pasta but it is very good quality so we were happy to pay the price

i have been especially impressed by the service the staff are friendly and attentive without being annoying

i recommend you book a table as there have been queues of people outside on both occasions we have been there and one was a tuesday night, the place is nice and the waiters are very friendly but the food is at best average
i had an arigula salad with pears and they showed up with a bowl full of arigula with a few pieces of canned pears at the bottom the vinaigrette was very sarce and not very tasty
my wife had a cheese pizza andit was as bad as any pizza you could buy on a street corner
not impressed with these ratings, had a dinner with a friend last friday ordered two appetizer and two pastas i ordered alio olio which was not in the menu but turn out as good choice it would be even better if they can serve some beer like peroni too, excellent choice

staff is friendly and having discussion at each tables good advices also

food is great we had mozzarella and parma ham to start then two nice and large pizza and a panacotta as dessert which was probably the less convincing choice if we want to point at something

you can actually find a wine affordable with a fair result which is not always the case and to go with pizza you definitely dont want to go for the best wine of the list

prices are not cheap but we had definitely seen worst qualityprice ratio in shanghai

last the atmosphere of this restaurant is great which make a very enjoyable time

would definitely go again, pricy but very good this is the place to go to and then end up at the bar fellows
cant be much better than this, frankly speaking i was hesitating a bit on giving five points after my visit service was excellent starters as well tartare di manzo caprese pizza was just really good but i had better ones in europe coffee and grappa just normal
on other side a very nice atmosphere in evening maybe also really cosy
why i hesitated a bit because compared to other restaurants in shanghai generally i feel this one is a bit overrated reconsidering all over i decided to give five points because it is really a very good place and with guests wanting italian food in shanghai near the bund i will come back here, i have been visiting china for over 10 years and i am so happy on the last trip i discovered this restaurant i will say hands down this is the best dinner i have ever had in china it was amazing the sheer attention to detail and the quality of the food is what makes it remarkable so food and wine was excellent then the level of service was beyond my past experiences such great standards i am horrible with names but i think luca greeted us and had so many good recommendations overall perfection and on the bund so easy to find i would suggest a reservation as well, the restaurant is small and you cannot get there unless you have a reservation or its sunday evening but its worth the effort the food is excellent the wine menu is good without being extensive and the team will make you feel at home even if they have the place packed sure there are options fancier and with better facilities in town but this is the place to go to have a great business dinner or enjoy with friends, we always make a reservation when in shanghai great atmosphere great cocktails fantastic food and amazing service

always a nice getaway from the local hustle and bustle, this restaurant was recommended by our private guide we were delighted to have followed her advice the head waiter italian was very friendly we enjoyed the food staterscarpacio beef and tartar tuna pasta ravioli to share main course osso bucco everything was upto our expectations, are you craving for original talian food theres 2 places worth to visit in shanghai and goodfellas is one of them the antipasti is amazing they have great wine selection at fair pricing and the truffled ravioli delivers well on the promise if you feel like eating beef go for the tagliatta or the ossobuco that come with an azafran risotto finish with the housemade tiramisu you should meet marco the best host in shanghai and owner of goodfellas, once we stepped into the cosy little restaurant we were already greeted by at least two waiters who made sure we promptly received our drinks of choice which for us is always a bottle of sparkling water and red wine and made us feel very welcome the music and decoration in the restaurant is very vintage yet modern we ordered a sharing starting platter and got two free platters with delicious tomato bread and bruschetta the sharing platter had a very good variety of all sorts of delicious treats such as camembert salmon salami as a main course  although at this point we were already full  we had a truffle mushroom pizza which i liked very much but my boyfriend found mediocre the prices are fine for dining at the bund but it can get pricey depending on your meal choices at the end of our meal the waitress gave us shots of free limoncello and a small dessert it was a lovely evening a delicious meal outstanding service and we will soon return, goodfellas is small but perfectly formed exuding atmosphere and chutzpah the italian manager is charming and the service is amongst the best weve experienced whilst living in china the ossobucco and saffron risotto is a real treat and the large pizzas disappeared in no time you could spend 200 rmb per head or much more depending on your budget but make sure you book as its hugely popular, really enjoyed this place and it was nice to find somewhere with a bit of atmosphere and character so close to the bund which can tend to be a bit businesslike and sterile still predominantly full of western tourists and expats but nevertheless a great option is youre visiting the area and fancy a tasty italian meal that wont break the bank the music was great and the rat pack style decor though not original was tastefully done

we started with the shared starter platter for 2 people for around 350 rmb a little pricey perhaps but honestly i cant advocate ordering this enough see photo and if you do dont order much for a main course its clearly the jewel in the crown of their menu and was filling enough as a meal in its own right a wide range of small dishes such as delicious goose liver cured meats salmon baked camembert and bruschetta we complemented this with glasses of an excellent house shiraz for around 70 rmb the only negative and reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is that the pizza we shared for a main course wasnt great overcooked and lacking in topping or cheese with a slightly bitter taste we were so full after the starter and were enjoying the charismatic service so much that this didnt matter but really you expect a good italian restaurant to get their pizza right we finished or meal with a complementary limoncello and mini biscuits and left happy, same owner of the fellas the food is decent both better drinks upstairs at the fellas the service is good the italian waiter is funny, i heard a lot about this restaurant most good i dont understand that its too cramped too smaal with too many tables and the food is nothing special very elementary italian its ok but then way too expensive, the food here is exceptional we went on a sunday night with n reservation and luckily got a seat as soon as we were seated the manager greeted us gave us the menu and we were treated to a fine plate of breads
it took us almost an hour to choose our mains as everything on the menu sounded perfect we ended up having 3 courses irish style coffee and all of it was superb the chocolate mints and macaroons at the endperfection, well located small upperclass restaurant with excellent food and wines for everyone who is tired of chinese food in shanghai, great fantastic food good wine we were there just a normal sunday evening reserved a table great service, amazing food and staff were so friendly would highly recommend ravioli were sensational atmosphere was very easy going desert was delicious, its the third time that ive been here with family friends and for business and the team always impress the restaurant is small so book in advance but really this only adds to the relaxed atmosphere and wonderful service and engagement by the staff all this is obviously backed up with a varied menu of fresh italian staples with some twists providing wonderful food and great wines which cater for everyones tastes, excellent meal earlier this week complimentary glass of prosecco on arrival nice basket of breads and oils to nibble on whilst we perused the menu brilliant service  especially from luca he was so helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations i opted for the black cod and it was so good fantastic atmosphere  the restaurant was very busy but that just added to the ambience and the service was never compromised delicious meal good value and excellent service thank you luca and all the team at goodfellas, very authntic italian food and wines fresh and warm bread as appatizer dont miss the ravioli state of the art dish service is professional and the restaurant manager in an amazing italian goodfellas very nice atmosphere and good music, best italian in town possibly in china portions are big food is authentic and service is excellent luca is a great professional and entertainer, small and cozy this is one of the best italian restaurants in town authentic food and decor cant go wrong, was in shanghai during 2 weeks with my job and i had my birthday during that period so went to goodfellas with a colleague after a recommendation was really good food wine and service can highly recommend, having lived in italy i am always skeptical of italian restaurants outside of italy because of the necessity of adjusting the italian kitchen to local taste in this case there was no adjustment goodfellas maintains a cook from italy antoinio and an italian maitre dhotel luca the staff is fluent in english and joy is exactly what her name signifies friendly open experienced charming and encouraging the food is as good as one might expect in italy because i am lactose intolerant luca recommended pasta not listed on the menu it was superb the ravioli were as expected excellent i found a nice fresh chianti on the wine list and the homemade limoncello was just as good as i serve at home we left with kisses and embraces and i was able to speak to luca and antonio in italian for the hour and a half we were transported to italy who could ask for anything more in a restaurant it is certainly the best italian restaurant in shanghai it may be the best restaurant in shanghai treat yourself, what a great find for a jet lagged couple tuna tartare was sensational and the beef carpaccio sublime the pizza was a perfect share and the wine spot on and the service friendly and efficient what not to like would recommend to anyone, tried this restaurant while on a business trip to shanghai last month a nice place to hit some decent italian food when in shanghai
i normally always try out the arrabiata or the amatriciana but tried out their ravioli instead as the chef was not keen on deviating from the combinations on the menu have to say it was above par and a great mix of texture and taste
the restaurant has a great ambience and is a great option for expats looking for nonchinese food in the city
i would recommend though they play more authentic italian music then something from the rat pack
pricing is premium for what it is, this might be the best restaurant in shanghai the food was amazing and the service impeccable compared to most places in shanghai super satisfied and will come back here a lot more, this is a cozy but inviting restaurant whose chef is italian and has been in the restaurant business for over 35 years the food is classic homestyle with generous portions of pastas and pizzas salads were huge and fresh with authentic italian greens like arugula and radicchio id recommend the goose liver aka foie gras the lasagna and the tagliatelle lamb ragu the restaurant has a friendly and welcoming staff, we had an fantastic evening on the first day of christmas the food was great the service was excellent and the atmosphere felt like being at home

very rare to find such with such a good price quality ratio in shanghai","Turkish cuisine",0.999829637817612
40,"the restaurant has a mix of western china mongolia and arab cuisine and they do a phenomenal job the lamb dish was perfectly seasoned the chicken well cooked and combined with peppers and vegetables and the pork prepared with a unique spice the complementing plates of yogurt and rice pudding offered an ideal dessert a total of four dishes three drinks and two desserts for three people cost a total of $26

would strongly recommend for large or small groups there are dancers on certain nights later in the evening making ambiance more festive would definitely go back, the restaurant was very centrally located and 15 min walking distance from bund they serve local dishes dishes are halal and very tasty our friends in shanghai helped us in choosing the food items according to our taste all the dishes were superb one must try this restaurant while visiting the bund in shanghai, the price quality ratio is extreme hard to eat for more than 100 rmb per head  including drinks the food is not perfectly authentic but remains good and part of best in shanghai can you without any hesitation for good friend or family lunch or dinner service is authentic those who have visited xinjiang would understand , excellent food and fast service lamb pancakes were delicious and so was the yoghurt beef and tomato soup was very delicious too prices are higher than most xin jian restaurants, convenient place of delicious halal food in the city everytime i come here id try different dishes and each simply satisfying nice ambience too and always full house lamb is almost the main meat for the dishes with interesting variety and tasty spices they have a lot of food options from lamb chicken and seafood the fresh juices  i think no sugar added which is  are made up from fruits mixture refreshing
they also have performance on a stage in middle of the restaurant bit loud for me but mostly others enjoy it, the food is great and awesome we ordered the kebabs and rice dishes the chicken is nice too wonderful experience, ive dined here twice now and i cannot priaise this place highly enough the food is perfect served quickly with a massive choice the dancing is an added bonus unless your unlucky enough tho be picked to dance i love the spicy lamb kebabs and the frsh vegtables are always lovely lucky for me its opposite our chinese office, the food here was excellent it is based on turkish cooking but is influenced by chinese so lots of grilled meat and spicy dishes the beer can be ordered in a massive tall jar with a tap that will serve 45 people, the food here is quite good from my point of view please do try it for your own experience location is tricky at first but easy to find on your 2nd trip just locate the mm world and proceed to 7th floor one thing i do wish is the waiters can speak english to an international audience since most days its pack with both locals and foreign people a must place to try if you are in shanghai a word of advice get your smart phone translator ready if you would request for something or the basic hand gestures will do to ,  typical chinese halal food very delicious and serveral dishes
 normally it is full specially on weekends but they have a small waiting area
 quite big from inside i had the feeling i am in a big mall
 at the middle of the restaurant there is a stage i guess for live shows but i was unlucky not to see one
 as most of chinese restaurants service is quite fast, after moving to shanghai from kazakhstan i have been craving some really good uyghur food i found it at yershari xinjiang food you will find authentic uyghur dishes including the pilafs to your liking the kebabs were wonderful it felt and smelled like central asia

be forewarned this place is popular make reservations or plan to sit about 30 minutes waiting for a seat, it serves uygur foods very good very tastey and it has a good value for the budget
one of a waiter speaks english
they accept credit card
i recommend this place to visit
three of us were visited the restaurant and we eat a lot drunk bear and we payed only 100 rmb per person, barbecue and lamb are delicious not very luxury but good  cozy and fast definitely recommended, this restaurant is my local friend introduce me when i visit shanghai
food is truly amazing and delicious environment like xinjiang interior
to meat lover you should come this restaurant to try their original xinjiang food especially lamb bbq lamb oil rice kebab etc

for friends gathering this is a good place to hang out if want to avoid crowd please come after 2pm5pm 8pm onward

staff are friendly and helpful they treat customer with sincere<u+3002>

 restaurant served halal food but also selling beer for looking 100 halal restaurant i think this is not your choice, if you like lamb dishes give it a try serves good xinjiang food all dishes are good excellent taste and always busy, what a best way to enjoy western chinese cuisine with such a great ambiance of its culture just hope that other customers wouldnt be that loud, i come here without fail every time in shanghai this is uyghur traditional halal food food is amazing and sumptuous ive tried over 10 dishes and they are excellent the menu has pictures of high quality so easy to choose the lamb dishes are the best enjoy on sunday night we had live uyghur dancing, absolutely perfectfoods are very clean rooms are very comfortable most important point is foods are delicious, its really tasty food  style is like middle east food  they have amazing noddles great mushrooms soup and barbecue staff are friendly, great food i thought it was a middle eastern restaurant until my friend convinced me that it is actually an eastern chinese cuisine either way the food was just great kudos to the lamb skewers go and have a try, we went to the one near <u+5a04><u+5c71><u+5173><u+8def> loushangguan road 2 subway station with our 3yo  5yo girls my parents and my sister a great place for a family visit
 get a table its very popular and need to reserve ahead or be prepared to wait
 food delicious and a change from the usual chinese cuisine the lamb leg is super tender the famous <u+5927><u+76d8><u+9e21> chicken dish is nicely flavored with potato and the flat noodle  tastes like handmade  the portion is huge
 performance  we arrived at 6pm and there are multiple dance performance till around 730pm the performance is nicely spaced out and great break for the family the kids are very well entertained and didnt need any ipad or drawing time  the grandparents were happy too my mum even went on the stage to dance together 
 drink a great selection of freshly squeezed juice and my husband liked the xinjiang beer
 service  not great its very busy and somehow it took multiple tries to get our flat bread order right

overall we will definitely go again next time in shanghai food is great kids are happy  what can we ask more , iranian owned restaurant at six pm there ara dacers for some minutes the best food and atmosphere in the xianjing pudong area fast service excellent food very fast sevice ask for menu with pictures and english, good selection of arabic styled food with strong flavours
worth the visit
stage show act every 30 minutes are so in the evening, this is my go to halal restaurant i love the yangrou kao baozi and the shouzhua fan will keep coming regularly for as long as i can get it, great meat platters kebabs and meat dishes in general the hummus is pretty decent i go to this restaurant often and plan to keep it that way, went here with a friend heard great stories about the wonderful food especially the lamb the menu has a lot of choice especially lamb dishes we ordered a mix of meat  vegetables and bread which went down a treat with a couple of beers worth a visit , this place caught me by surprise a local recommended it and said it was a chinesemuslim food i think it had a flair of mediterranean for sure they also had entertainment with a singer and dancers that came around the tables we got there earlier and it already was packed when we left there was a large number of groups waiting for a table i definitely recommend this place if you are on nangjin road, we ordered new dishes and as usual the taste was excellent the services the meet and pototato dish was very tasty, nice halal chinese food the way of cooking dressing serving and overall great experience at entrance with making a memorial printed photo it gives a nice feeling of different experience the food i tried were lamb kebab chaiwopu spicy chicken with some separate dishes of vegetable make me fan of their food, the food here is awesome and i loved it im not sure how authentic but was excellent for a visitor the service was good and menu had a wide range of options no surprises as what you see is what you get i tried the outlet at the 7th floor of a mall close to the peoples square same building as the mms outlet and close to le meriden hotel there are several branches around the city too a friend of mine tried the one on the 2nd floor of a mall in pudongopposite to the shangri laritz carlton, nice place to bring friends and family to experience northwestern chinese xinjiang cuisine and its a halal restaurant waiting time can be long if you go at meal times so avoid midday and 67pm unless you dont mind waiting for at least an hour you can buy the lamb skewers at the side to wait and there are little stools with refreshments while waiting and kids can try the traditional headdresses too i enjoyed the traditional dance performance which gave this place an extra boost especially if you get to sit close to the stage thumbs up, i was really looking forward to going here as i had heard lots of good things about it online and from a friend

i have been lucky enough to visit quite a few xinjiang restaurants over the past few years and this one seemed a bit gimmicky none of the staff seemed to be from the region but most of them were wearing the xinjiang ethnic dress there was also a bizarre performance which involved very loud speakers and some dancing ladies but none of it seemed very authentic and in truth i felt like i was eating in a ktv karaoke bar

as for the food they have all of the standard xinjiang dishes here and my parents loved it i think this type of food is very suited to westerners tastes the food was very nice but the meat was a tad dry it came to around 100rmb a head but we were stuffed and really enjoyed the experience there are probably more authentic xinjiang restaurants in shanghai but this one is good fun and has decent quality food being close to nanjing road the location is also very convenient for tourists, best ethnic uhiygur food we have tasted in china

lovely venue 7th floor of mall on east nanjing street near peoples square metro entrance

the beef fried in cumin was delicious as were the fresh fruit juices

perfect last meal in shangai too, i found their food pretty delicious with diverse range of varieties and yeah pretty economic another thing is the cultural dance representation food music and dance good entertainment, amongst the best xinjiang restaurant with their signature spicy meat dishes and in large portions mostly lamb a bit crowded and rowdy but really great food fast service and the singkiang beer is very good all halal dishes will strongly recommend, if youre a meat lover then this is the right place for you their barbecue is so tasty and the nan is also good theyve fresh juice as well and all with an affordable price its my favorite so far ive been here so many times so i do recommend it to all of you enjoy, despite the poor quality of service this restaurant is really nice to discover at a very low price the yershari food

the menu has many various choices, i have in different yershari and always very satisfied both in business and also with the family the kids love this place

the food is really good pricely and delicious especially the satay and the lamb dishes
there is also entertainment with cultural dancing and belly dancing if you are lucky the dancers can pick you up to dance together with them
i really recommend this place, the restaurant has good location in shanghai famous pedesterian road named nanjing they have good menu and different type they are offering kebap and the local meal together the price is good for another restaurant they have show with bellydancer and barmen mixed grill is good choice you can test whole thing in a plate, this is a nice place with halal food 1st time tasted authentic xinjiang food in shanghai especially bbq lamb sticks and ambience is nice i would definitely visit this restaurant again for next trip to shanghai, met with my client here for meat dinner feast

had various bbq of lamb on sticks and lamb chop which taste simply awesome
tender soft and well cooked without too much lamb smell

tried the yogurt too which has a unexpected western taste which helps soothe the meat and neutralise the spicy food we had

ordered a pot of cold sweeten milk tea in a football lookalike pot

the restuarant was filled with both locals and expatriates and they even have short xinjiang expression shows by beautiful artists in the midst of the dinner

friendly and responsive waitresses meeting our needs

definitely a place to visit or to bring your visitors to shanghai here for a fulfilled dinner meal, quite accessible and closer to peoples square subway station authentic xinjiang cuisine made with complete heart and soul menu includes a few turkish dishes as well service due to the crowding appears to be slow and you sometimes may have to chase for your order
overall great experience and a must go for dwellers and visitors who are looking for a great deal on halal food, went here with a group of guests and everyone loved every dish i couldnt see anyone hating xinjiang food as it was really full of flavor

the staffs are very friendly and managed to help us taking pictures from all of our phones 

will definitely be back here again, at first u will reserve a table for how many persons u areits everytime full so you have to wait around 1030min if you are more than 3persons time goes longer
especially lamb shish kebab is the famous and my favourite one if u like meat you can order 1520 each for one person and u will be full except this fried brown rice french green bean salad home made bread and all other foods are really delicious prices are quite cheapif u go there really hungry and wanna leave full with all this yummy foods u will pay max 100 yuan drink included
afiyet olsun , oh this resturant is very uniq with full of halal food in shanghai i recommend every one to try it unlimited menue very delicouse dishes with nice meet all is good you can try the shisha and see the dancer thier yougort is very nice too, great place for amazing food would like to visit again with friends dont miss bowl of home made yogurt if you visit here, delicious food specially for those people do not like chinese food although it is muslim restaurant you can order drinks there are traditional dancers on nights, we tried new yelixiali in lujiazui we ordered 6 different dishes some chicken some lamb dishes were very yummy  spice was perfect  and i think per person 200 yuan not overprice including one beer recommended for spice lovers, we had searched botyershari restaurant in shanghai but when we went there we were slightly awed at it was quite up scaledthe waiting time is15 to 30 minutesthewhole environment was fascinatingtotally crowded with people from all coutrieswe ordered lamb shashliked and photoessays with green chillies plus yughur pilaf
all fir110 yuanwe found it so cheap we went again next day and tried other dishesall tasty and reasonably priceit serves halal food and has five or six branches in shanghaithe food was mouth watering, my brother who is a texan living in shanghai took me here he described it as western chinese food it did seem to have indian influences in the flavors i thought everything we ordered was very good and quite different from other foods i had eaten on my trip the service was a bit spotty but i think they didnt have enough servers for all the customers we had to wait for a table so that speaks to the popularity of the place","Chinese cuisine",0.999794098778806
41,"my nephews wife in shanghai suggested that we go to this place for western food last saturday for dinner

i believed that the name of the restaurant came from the laundry room in usa or so

their salad was quite nice really

their truffles fries were not bad either

they do have a lot of different varieties of miniburgers

their chicken was soft and succulent so i cannot complain much about it

their pizza was also really huge and just right to the taste with the right ingredients

however their beef was really rawly cooked and my husband complained that he got the runs after we came back home

i also got bloated tummy i believed that it must be from the a little raw beef that i ate

a variety of beers for you to taste too if you are really into wine tasting

atmosphere is definitely cosy but just too noisy that you can hardly hear each other talk, i had dinner there with my colleague

i did not had any of the alcholic drinks but sitting in front of the bar i could see that the bartenders took much effort for each and every drink that they prepare

currently they offer some happy hour on thursday night but i am not too sure what it was

my dinner was half a roasted chicken but it wasnt too great

overall a nice place to chill out after work, another excellent brunch spot in shanghai salmon bagelwich is great atmosphere is pumping just a little too noisy if you need to discuss business, nice restaurant in a very nice and unique design but a very bad service unfriendly slow no english
pizzas and salads are nice but no other food in the afternoon, hits the spot for a vacation from your diet
great waffles the only place that does them well in shanghai
fried chicken sandwich also delicious
smoked salmon over potato hash topped with ikura was a favorite as well
heavy eating but sometimes you crave a bit of american comfort food, it was a rainy sunday evening so we went downstairs to lil laundry here in shanghai centre the experience was once again underwhelming no happy hour on weekends food overpriced staff plentiful but selfabsorbed the next time we will get out the umbrellas if needed and head over to world of beer where the welcome is always warm and drinks and food choices are good and wellpriced, we came to shanghai for the night just to have dinner weve decided on ll because of the great reviews online they were fully booked as it was a saturday night and had to wait at the bar great selection of micro brewed beer on tap local and international special beer sample menu besides beer they have an excellent cocktail and wine list good variety of dishes on the menu that will suit everyone very vibey with kind of a party atmosphere without being loud 5050 expat local crowd i love it its great go, my first time visit worth it ll is an excellent choice to go for brunch great atmosphere friends and families gathering together to enjoying themselves, not my first time here but its always worth another visit due to the frequent cycling of their craft brews some excellent ipas and stouts on offer this time  and it all goes well with their pizzas enjoy, liquid laundry brunch is the bomb from sweet to savory light to hearty boozy to boozier its got it all food is top notch but space is a bit large so things can get noisy family friendly and a place you bound to run in to friends no matter when you go, i usually go ll because its a safe bet on having a nice drink either beer or cocktail maybe sat on a comfy sofa after a long day working or after a nice exhibition if youre into american style ipa and small brewery beer this is the place but also if you like a properly made cocktail negroni is good food is not bad but nothing really special maybe some salads or some fish dish can be particularly good, always a safe bet
great food attentive staff and good music is always guaranteed here
surprisingly the pizza is like top 3 in the city1, me and my husband love this place the interior design is amazing the best thing about this place is foot especially pizza we love got wood pizza here are other great points they brew their own beer smoking room is separate there are kids chairs available, have heard about this bar a lot and finally decided to visit place with trendy atmosphere loft with dj playing too loud music  if you want to talk to your friends be ready to lose your voice next day or forget about communication beer is good pizza is fine but first of all it is a beer bar and people would like to eat something appropriate like hamburger or all these beer snacks instead i saw a menu with fancy food which would be good for a french restaurant but not for a place with beer concept dear owners you really think that those who drink beer will also enjoy miniburgers or all these seafoodfancysalads taste is ok nothing special though price is high twice higher than in other beer bars of shanghai service as was many times mentioned is slow rather wont go there anymore 3 out of 10, extra crispy hash browns �<u+9999><u+714e><u+571f><u+8c46><u+9165><u+9905><u+914d><u+9178><u+5976><u+6cb9><u+771f><u+7684><u+662f><u+5f88><u+8d0a><u+7684>hash browns<u+571f><u+8c46><u+7d72><u+9905><u+7d72><u+5207><u+5f97><u+5f88><u+7d30><u+8868><u+9762><u+70b8><u+5f97><u+5f88><u+9165><u+914d><u+4e0a><u+6211><u+6700><u+611b><u+7684><u+7da0><u+8525><u+9178><u+5976><u+6cb9><u+5361><u+8def><u+88cf><u+518d><u+9ad8><u+90fd><u+4e0d><u+518d>care<u+3002>, this place is great the food is good and the bar has a good atmosphere  staff are friendly and helpful  a good place to go for food and drinks , didnt eat here but came for drinks a wide selection of craft beer and also their cocktails were really unique and tasty staff were friendly too, like the place the food and service is very good as well special thanks to lia awesome servjce doesnt happen much here in shanghai, i have to say that the modern vibe with micobrewery goes well its my goto for large groups and dates when you need a central location and want to drink comfortably, choice beers in a cool environment staff was hit or miss but who really cares when you are drinking a locally made beer

highlight was when the djs started really kept my head boppin and any silences between conversation an opportunity to hear good music

will be returning with more friends and coworkers for sure, i come to this restaurant a lot and i like the design of the restaurant its very modern and cool the food here is very good and the waiters are friendly but its hard to communicate with them because they dont understand english, so this was my second visit here i was pleased i came here again after a long day at work we were ready for a feast we had starters and a main the result was that we were truly stuffed the food was absolutely delicious we didnt have a long wait either which is always impressive in such a busy restaurant we had a sixbeer sample tray which was also fantastic we ended up having two trays ill be coming again on my next visit, come for the beer stay for the foodmusicpeople watching i would start with the sampler and go from there good for day chilling or night pregaming they also carry a solid selection of spirits so dont sleep on the cocktails i usually stick to the beer though, i was looking over the restaurants across the street from my hotel there are three in this buildingi looked over the menu which was mainly sandwiches and bar food which go when that is what you are looking for i was not this evening the food has some asian influence i when to one of the other restaurants, wow what a great saturdaysunday brunch place classic american breakfast options with a twist try the classic bloody mary also available as a virgin drink i loved the carnitas breakfast sandwich we also enjoyed the korean fried chicken sandwich as well as the biscuits and gravy though the latter was quite different from what ive had in the us

djs spinning live techno music makes the place feel hip decent service and a great location a bit pricy but worth it

we will be back, great place for drinks and parties vibe is always bustling regarding what day it is they are usually full so try to call in to secure a table

foodwise their pizzas are not bad and their roasted chicken is good apart from that most of the menu items rarely change and it does get boring after a while bar snacks are good service staff always looks overwhelmed and it can be hard to get their attention at times

would go back for drinks but not for dinner, except at a few tables the place is dark inside service is a bit slow beers and food are good but highly prices shanghai brewery offers better valur for money shganghai brewery or even boxing cat are better pub breweries offering more value for money than ll and you can see with whom and what you eat and drink, brunch food is truly american food loved it smoked salmon egg benedict avocado toast potato hash brown with corned beef and egg all them must try very pleasant atmosphere although place is busy all the times
dinner menu is well rounded with a lot of choices pizza must try beer selection is great including boxing cat brewery selection for sure will be back price is moderate, this is a must stop brewery in shanghai
great selection of beers and excellent menu

this korean chicken sandwich was unique but the chicken was not good quality  i would not order it again, compared to other restaurants in shanghai the pizza here is great between here and calypso i would say its a draw
would not recommend the pastrami sliders cant remember exactly how they were labelled on the menu but the other appetizers i tried were quite good
overall nice ambiance and typical service
side note the table we were seated at was in a bit of an annoying location however because people consistently brushed our table as they were walking by waiters and patrons included i think the layout of the tables could use some improvement it feels a bit awkward as some tables are close together and others such as the ones by the window are more isolated
in conclusion if you want decent western food in shanghai id check this place out, ll goes down in my mind as the sexiest craft beer bar in asia great beer selection pricing was great and food was top notch do the flight for 88 rmb i had the meat lovers pizza the bomb, this was a fun place on a saturday night with good music and lots of people enjoying their food and friends we were a family of 4 but there were several other tables with kids and we were comfortable the cocktails were very good and the food was creative and tasty if i lived here i would visit over and over to try the many interesting options on the menu service was good, ive been here quite a few times but enjoy it most for brunch as a bacon lover its her not to like a place that offers a bacon flight sampler the hash browns are absolutely delicious and as a north carolinian i can vouch for the grits  theyre delicious ive tried a few of their vegetarian options as well which are all delicious

for dinner i tried the pizza mac and cheese calamari and a few other things  all of it delicious, came here whilst visiting shanghai the restaurant is really quirky and well fitted out the menu had a good selection and the drinks list was great also we opted for a shiraz which was really good

from the menu we had duck croquettes and pate to start both of which were very good and then we all had the pork to follow which wasnt as nice as we had hoped very dry and lots of fat hopefully just picked the wrong dish definitely worth a visit as its a really nice restaurant with friendly staff, id say that the best thing about this place is the overall look of the place but apart from that the food is not good the rotisserie chicken is tasteless and the pizzas are terrible over 15 dollars for a notbig basic pizza that tastes below average no thank you over 10 dollars for a very small beer that tastes mediocre is a rip off in my book and 13+ dollars for average cocktails on the small side its definitely not for me, great place to hang out with friends it has a relaxed atmosphere and you could happily stay for as long as you want
food is mouthwateringly superb and theres a real range of food not sure what kind of food youd label it as maybe american but it all looked delicious
very busy but this only added to the atmosphere it was packed when we went and luckily we had a reservation im not sure you need to make a reservation but if you know youre going then theres no harm, we liked the vibe of the place and the food was pretty good we especially fell in love with the desserts and some of the appetizer specials we ordered the fat elvis and strawberry shortcake, really underwhelmed by this place in a weird location like in an apartment block it was recommended by a local which is how i found it really nothing special big space standard industrial stylie pub grub beer and a dj expensive average really hence the three stars, i was only in town for a few short days from the south of china and this was all the guilty pleasure i needed in one place not a place for calorie counters, a place where young chinese go to show they are cool food is so so la la second time when we went its kind of trend now to go there with friends not sure will go again, amazing concept cool music and great food with decent portions ive been there a couple of times and its good for dinner and having drinks after, its a perfect place to grab a drink or two nice service and good location close to many other bars, i love this place its a cool hangout they offer great food  nice ambience its hard to get a seat so i suggest you make a reservation hostess are not to helpful or friendly but besides that there is nothing to complain about this place food portion is rather generous  they offer a beautiful selection of menu to choose from i love their pizzas  french fries they also have a cool bar where you can have a drink to start off overall a great place to chill, i like to go to liquid laundry the style of the restaurant is good i went here several time like sunday brunch or dinner if youre in shanghai try it, liquid laundry has a true western brunch for expats you can get anything from biscuits to waffles to eggs and bacon they have many unique items like house made sausage and bacon excellent cocktails like bloody mary and mimosa, after hearing about the place we booked a reservation for a thursday night upon arriving we were greeted by the smell of epoxy resin that stayed with us our entire meal pungent is probably an overstatement but it was very very noticeable and affected everything we tasted the beer was ok but didnt rock me i like our domestic microbrews better the food was meh portions small and expensive, id heard a lot about this place and decided to go over for lunch

bear in mind that this is one of the happening places in shanghai currently and therefore you absolutely have to book a table before showing up

even though i went for a late lunch this place was packed to the rafters

i ordered their pink ale out of curiosity it was more light brown rather than pink and was very average

i also ordered their burger the serving portion was fairly decent and while the meat had been cooked to my specifications the taste was nothing special

i was fortunate that the service was prompt and attentive

having tried it once i didnt find anything to pull me back, liquid laundry is situated on a popular street very close to downtown and main shopping areas of shanghai so the place gets very busy even on weekdays ll brews are okay i tried their ipa and was happy what i did not like was their service  for every piece of dining element we had to hail a passing wait staff seemed like we had a table in the middle of nowhere food was average would not go there for quality food if you have a group of 6 or more and your main objective is to grab a draught beer and engage in whats up conversation  then go for it otherwise steer clear of liquid laundry, excellent choice of brunsh items and brunch cocktails i recommend the veggie eggs bennie and the fruit waffles they have delicious coffee and brunch cocktials make sure you reserve in advance as the place gets packed during the weekends service does not suffer though as they have plenty of welltrained staff to take care of you i try to make it to ll every weeken super fun with friends they also have delicious lunch specials during the week, i enjoyed my evening at this funky restaurant the food was great and the menu had something for everyone i had an excellent gin cocktail with celery in it that was so delicious i am already dreaming of the next time i have it i dont remember the name but it was the first on the cocktail list totally worth a try","Healthy",0.999747395383889
42,"i have had the opportunity to enjoy very good breakfasts and taste foods from different continents the selections are numerous , this is an expensive buffet but lucky for us we were treated there are many many choices from various asian foods soups noodles meats in just about any variety of ways served can be had here sushi and desserts too if you are vegetarian there are enough items to fill you up the food and restaurant is high quality at a fine hotel, best buffet in shanghai most expensive one too a lot of choices always jam and packed with people highly recommended, this is truly a grand buffet everything one might imagine is available and the quality excellent there are numerous staffed food preparation and cooking stations with helpful smiling people to help you with your selections smoked fish was superb as were many of the dim sum items we sampled this place should not be missed a bit pricy but worth every bit, if youve been away from home a long time youll find whatever food youre missing here food from all around the world you can try and have it all if you can stomach it the quality of meat and fish is excellent very nice for a celebration and it was a great day out with friends i cant really comment on the price as this was purchased using a voucher, this restaruant has a lo of locals as well as hotel guests the quality of the food and the wide range of choices make it very popular, i was staying at the shangrila hotel recently and made sure that i found time for breakfast at the yi cafe  it was in the price of my hotel room after all the choice is fantastic i especially liked the made to order omelettes which i complemented with the full english including bacon sausages hash browns  baked beans heavenly there was also a fantastic cheese board and cold cuts of meats with various chorizo type sausage the english breakfast tea was a bit weak but the cappuccinos were well prepared

unfortunately as this was a business trip and i was on a fairly tight schedule i couldnt really linger and try a bit of everything on offer but that was probably just as well, really love the place
around 400<u+00a5>uaneach and very worth to try

all of the food is super very very nice we can find any food here therere a lot of great dish and dessert in here
lucky us to find hairy crab in here too

really love it, i had breakfsat there and was totally disappointed the waitresses were young and mostly trainee typesnot very friendly they are too busy clearing tables instead of giving you the shangrila services the food was average and not high quality like the park hyatt or the four seasons, just excellent a must try for great food and service with a variety and range that is catering to all nationalities, yi cafe is one of my best restaurant experiences ever i was starstruck of the elegant buffet with so much different food from many countries i am glad we started early for dinner because then i could find the food i wanted many times throughout the evening there was high quality of all the food i ate but i especially liked the japanese buffet with firstclass sushi the service was also firstclass and our waiter nick did exactly what he should to make us feel comfortable if i come back to shanghai this is my first choice of revisiting restaurant, having buffet at yi cafe after 4 years was a nice experience the brunch includes almost anything you want from western to chinese  indian etc price wise i could call yi cafe very good value by shanghai standards only issue is sometimes waiters got so busy and cant cope with the cleaning of previous tables a better reservation system could be arranged will go back again yess, yi cafe has the longest line with foods which i had ever enjoyed before it is in 2nd floor of shangrila hotel and it is the best place to have your breakfast if you live in shangrila hotel there are chinese food western food and even india food you can enjoy not only gongee and soy milk  but also hkgz style dim sum  steamed desert  you can also have ham and egg or fresh vegetable and bread

dont forget to have a visit to the cheese room upstairs children and adults may take home a box of sweets to remember the evening by the seafood section is particularly frequented by locals that know it is good value and good quality lobster crab and various others varieties the indian breads are delightful as well as the array of turkish kababs whether you want a business meal a quick meal of a relaxing evening talkingthis is the 1 place to be assured of good service and quality be sure to catch a taxi from the hotel rank as it is difficult otherwise there will be a wait, an impossible number of cuisines to choose from  all very tasty indeed  private room also available for larger group, it just went for miles perhaps ten different stations with a variety of asian and american food there were different and wonderful tastes at every station, if you need a quick meal at a modest price the yi cafe is great for those staying at the pudong shangrila, we went there for saturday dinner it was a celebration and we were a group of 5 family with kids since many were vegetarians  we had notified the indian chef to make us some customized dishes which he happily did we had also bought some coupons from dianping chinese website the food in all counters were very good but we really appreciated the thai chef and indian chef who customized lots of dishes in a buffet the non veg items were also very good like the prawns and salmon also the hummus in mediterranean counter was perfect the kids loved the chocolate fountain and desserts  in the end we had the option to take a small box of jellies  my only suggestion to make it better is though coffee and tea are included in buffet price it will be good to include soft drinks overall great experience and ideal for celebratory dinnerlunch, im so delighted in my stay at shangrila shanghai yi cafe is the place to eat middle eastern food and you feel like you are home im surprised how they could be able to make such authentic and tasty lebanese food in china
this place will be my second home every time i visit i recommend this place to all middle eastern that they go to shanghai and they dont want to compromise
with their food the service is just great and staff are so friendly love this place and their variety of food in yi cafe, had dinner here since i stayed at the hotel the restaurant is on the 1st floor very wide selection of cuisine excellent quality friendly service, you dont find a better buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner anywhere else in the world the variety is so great that you may sit for hours just enjoying food from all over the world first class all of it, we enjoyed having dinner at shangrila yi cafe a good place to gather for food and drinks allowed us to choose what we like to eat from many different countries cuisine we were so touched that the mgt n staff were so thoughtful to bring out our birthday cake and sang our birthday boy a birthday song we will go back again and again, this buffet restaurant has the best selection of international foods and they are all gourmet so many types of dim sum sushi deserts and many other foods you can indeed spend an entire week without tasting everything, the dining experience at yi cafe was truly enjoyable

patrons are spoilt with the great varieties of different cuisine around the world it served the freshest cold meat widespread seafood cold and hot preparation of the cooked food was exceptional and it also had very good selection of dessert

this must be one of the best buffet occasion and strongly recommended it to all the visitors and local shanghainese, best buffet dinner in shanghai price is higher than other places but definitely worth the money dinner is open until 10pm, breakfast at yi cafe came with my room rate so i ate here every day standard highend international buffet but taken up a big notch its huge and has an amazing variety of food from different cultures
the real amazement however wasnt breakfast it was lunch the lunch buffet is equally as varietyfilled and takes it up a notch again with oodles of options all delicious and a dessert bar with chocolate fountains and lolly cases for the kids
service was fairly efficient and id definitely recommend it if you want a splurge on a big lunch
on one occasion when we had to wait 5 minutes for a seat i partook in a free massage set up near the entrance delivered by the hotels spa nice, my family and i enjoyed an extravagent christmas buffet lunch at the yi cafe at the shangrila which was juts exquisite an amazing array of food dishes from all over the world and free flow champagne was as good as any buffet ive hadyou are really spoilt for choice they put on a great show  restaurant kitchen staff paraded through the center of the restaurant with pots and spoons clanging to a festive beat of we wish you a merry christmas to a standing ovation theres a kids playroom across the hall so mum and dad enjoyed a desert and more champagne in relative piece, i am living in shanghai and have many business guests every one who atayed in china knows the warm culture of chinese freinds that have to eat dinner or lunch toghether  i think this restaurant is the only one who offer moslem  halal food along with a large variety of western japanesechinese  indonesia cuisines and a very professional desserts all are offered with buffet type with presence of chefs to prepare food and salads
it is a really excellent place for different nationalities when want to have food toghether it will avoid embarrassing situations, stayed 6 nights and looked forward to breakfast each morning the staff are wonderful i couldnt have asked for more, we had breakfast there on our first and last day in shanghai huge buffet and good service it is a bit pricey for a breakfast but the variety is outstanding you have chinese western indian middle eastern fruits juices pastries and others

definitely recommend, i can enjoy my halal buffet breakfast lunch or dinner at yi cafe middleeast section its very rare 5 star hotel served halal food in the hotels restaurant, what a great easter brunch buffet great food selection fish meat indian chinese italian cold cuts cheese whatever food you may dream of nice service too, the cafe is very large and well spread out it took me a couple of days to understand that there are so many things that you can choose from, was recommended to yi cafe to experience a western  chinese buffet mix  an interesting mix of cuisine  this place is now dated and in need of an update, when i was stayed in shangrila pudong i used yi cafe for my first dinner and for the breakfast for three days dinner service is closing at 10 under a huge time pressure i choosed from one of the kitchen and paid a lot you are walking around and choose what you want there are different kitchens like sea food different chinese cuisine i found very good for the breakfast you can find whatever you like, the food has remained consistently good over the years at least during weekend buffets customers rush for seafood and other varieties of food from asia and the west i have noticed the wait staff literally run around since they need to always clear tables and this needs a solution our waiter seemed annoyed and never smiled even handed us bill an hour before closing at lunch and stood there until we paid cannot give five stars if i have to wave to get water or coffee and had to even clear my own plate once i was there with my wife to celebrate her birthday and although fb person promised to do offer a cake as a surprise and despite confirming twice there was nothing need to get your act together and do something about the service or, grow up in a food paradise city im extremely picky for food as frequent traveller food is almost everything for me to determine whether i love the city and perhaps decide for longer stay at once i was disappointing with shanghais food  until i found yi cafe in shangrila i love it thumbs up for overall, i visited yi cafe again with friends and family for a birthday treat it remains handsdown the best quality buffet with the largest variety of cuisines available it is expensive  we paid 400rmb per person on a saturday night but it is absolutely worth it

standouts were the carvery tandoori ovens and new pizza stands desserts were fantastic, i was very impressed by the buffet at the shangri las yi cafe it offered a combination of diverse western and asian dishes of excellent quality including valued products such as lobster price was reasonable and the personnel friendly and helpful, we arrived a little late and the yi cafe was closing but that didnt deter them they brought us in gave us a guided overview of the restaurant and where each component of the buffet could be found  and they have japanese chinese thai etc as well as western available connie and her wonderful team made us feel welcome didnt rush us and had some great suggestions for what to do with the rest of the evening really appreciated the outstanding service connie thank you well be back , we consider the buffet at the shangri las yi cafe the best buffet option in shanghai at time of this posting it offers a selection of western as well as asian dishes including chinese indian and japanese to name a few having lived in shanghai for 5 years now we have been coming here for breakfast and lunch a few times and the quality of the food has been consistently very high sunday brunch can get quite busy and while it doesnt have an all inclusive champagne option provided by other hotels the quality and variety of the food served is better at yi cafe waiters cover a larger number of tables than what you will see in local restaurants which is worth keeping in mind although we did not have any complaints about the service level on the contrary when we asked about things that we did not find in the buffet the staff generally immediately got it prepared for us we found the restaurant less busy during the latter part of the work week when hotel occupancy rates levelled off and conventions tend to end would recommended for breakfast and lunch, absolutely gorgeous hotel with an expansive buffet even had delicious pastries a must go if you are in shanghai, we had another memorable sunday lunch at yi cafe with over 30 people in attendance having lived in shanghai for 5 years now i still rate this as the best buffet meal in town with their selection and quality of food it is expensive but so worth it champagne and drinks packages are also available i just wish they had more people serving the tables and manning the ice cream station, a variety of choices but if you stay for more than 3 nights and visit more than once its not exciting anymore 8 i wonder whether a change of the variety would be more exciting
waiters and waitresses can be encouraged to have more smile on the face
cant find papers during the meal told them earl grey and they enough english breakfast perhaps could be more attentive, waiting staff are always attentive helpful friendly and professional kudos to the team

it is advisable that you go early before 800am or after 930am because it gets really busy during peak period as it caters to guests from both towers

but the setback of going after 930am is you generally get stale food in the chinese food section especially the dumplings wantons are soggy and broken and vegetables become seriously overcooked and over at the indian section the curry chicken is either cold or without any meat left in it i am surprised somehow no manager walks around to supervise and ensure food remains fresh and regularly refilled for the benefit of guests who prefer to come after peak period ironically i did see many management staff from the hotel having their breakfast at the cafe

the id of the cafe has not changed since it opened about 10 years ago likewise the buffet spread has also remained largely unchanged hence it becomes pretty boring after a few visits items such as steamed sweet corn and sweet potatoes are still served in this day and age

over at the patisserie section the croissants are tasteless and hard and cold the danish are however a lot tastier

i always use next2 cafe at shangrila bangkok as the benchmark and if you have been to next2 cafe you would definitely notice the marked difference it is so interesting lovely and lively

i hope the management would do some holistic soul searching and seriously look into refreshing the menu after 10 years i look forward to a substantially different menu in my next visit, i had an 8 hour layover in shanghai and decided to have brunch with family here what impressed me most about this place among many other things was its service which is completely opposite from what you would expect in shanghai or china for that matter people working there seemed that they really cared and valued me as a customer

i had just arrived after a long flight i was tired and sweaty i did not have a cell phone they were happy to let me use their telephone to call my family they even reserved a private room for us once they learned how many people were coming

the food was diverse and fantastic ranging from traditional shanghai to canton to thai and american you can have your dumplings or your omelet your noodle soup or hash brown people serving the food were again surprisingly courteous the ambience was topnotch especially with the private room

the price was definitely high for an average shanghainess running about $40 per person 240 rmb not bad for american standard though especially considering the location service and products

this will be my fav brunch place, we arrived here after making a reservation on a friday evening at 830pm as we approached the restaurant a young chinese waitress approached us to welcome us only to be pushed out of the way very rudely by the european maitred who said good evening and then turned to the waitress for here to take over maybe he should have just let her deal with us in the first place this was not a very good first impression for us

we were shown around the buffet by the waitress and taken to our table everything looked excellent after trying some of the food we were very disappointed all the food was stone cold especially in the chinese section the only food we tried that was good was the indian section and the dessert section

the bill for two of us came to nearly <u+00a3>100 for average food two beers and a bottle of water luckily we had some golden circle points which we used to pay for it

another annoyance was the walk through the reception area having to smell the ridiculous amount of air freshener they pipe through the public areas it was so bad we would hardly breath also do not plan on trying to get a taxi at the end of the evening they are nonexistent so after being ignored by the doormen who were dealing with transport for about 20 minutes a canadian guy who was also waiting said it was always like this we had to walk to the metro

it was not worth the travel over from xintandi, each time i am in shanghai at least one time i try to have a dinner here  it is amazing so much different sytes food from different varieties and countries in such a good quality i never experienced
normally no reservation is needed  but it is always full  a bit too many peple run around  so it is not a romantic atmosphere  please be aware also not a place for a quite business dinner aslo not a place where you should come later than 730 because after 800 first dishes are out or not fresh anymore
the rest is simply perfect  i will come back, over the years weve tried many different brunches in shanghai and we keep coming back to yi cafe time after time and that is why im giving it full marks

now if youre looking for amazing views over shanghai while you eat then im afraid thats the one thing you wont getyoull have to go up the floors to the jade on 36 bar for that

otherwise this restaurant has it all the staff are excellent and the management go out of their way to make you feel valued and welcome nothing is too much trouble

food wise there is a big variety here youll find an array of shellfish sushi salads breads chinese dishes noodles pasta and an array of european dishes if thats not enough then check out the indian and lebanese food youll be pushed to have space for the desserts and cheese

in addition to the food you can choose from freeflow drinks packages which cover soft drinks juices beerswines and champagne id say on average youre looking at spending around 500rmb <u+00a3>50$70usd per person plus a 15 services charge having said that at the time of writing this you can get a 15 discount if you book your table online via the shangrila website

in the interests of being fair ive noticed that the european food station hasnt been up to its usual quality of late and the cheese selection is small and lacks variety but ive no doubt that this will be corrected with the usual level of efficiency shown by the yi cafe staff

in closing i hope you enjoy the yi cafe as much as we have, friend took me there for lunch i was a bit skeptical knowing the price per person but variety of food and its quality make me changed my mind they have everything you may want to eat indian chinese sushi fried baked cooked wow if you eat a lot go for it if you like high quality of food go for it as well","cafe",0.506952154323238
43,"we have come here twice for lunch and have been thrilled both times with the quality of the food the artful presentation of the food and the creativity in the ingredients and presentation this is an excellent restaurant, its always a challenge to find healthy food in china  in thought of food not only the ingredients are super healthy dishes are nicely presented and taste amazing im very happy with my experience there  must come next time when i visit ps  dont forget their dessert and cocktail , this is a rare find on shanghai the food is nice clean and refreshing its a great place to have safe and tasty organic food that is prepared well we tried the brunch as it was the only option they had on sunday i found the slow cooked wagyu beef ok but i really liked the atlantic mackerel as it was very tasty we also had the salad buffet which had refreshing and tasty salad appetizers desserts were ok and the one that stood out was the carrot cake

will be back to try the regular menu, finding good organic and local options is sometimes tricky in shanghai and this restaurant not only delivers on those promises but also offers interesting and unique dishes some of the combinations such as black sesame with rice pudding for dessert are absolutely delicious we highly recommend visiting this restaurant especially on a nice sunny day when you can sit on the patio","Chinese cuisine",0.589006364825365
44,"a friend who used to live in shanghai took me to the unexpected tapas restaurant we sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and took a set tasting menu

the revisited tapas kept coming with a feast of flavors textures and ingredients fresh modern and creative with simple sophistication is how we could best describe these dishes and of course delicious all the way to the dessert, just visit the place couple days ago with friends overall a restaurant is very good nice ambiance very rustic design and look service stuff is professional and english fluent easy to make an order food comes as it cooked some of flavors are really good with solid food in overall some of dishes were not to a price what charged grilled rib eye steak was just ok not a lot of flavor chimichuri sauce was to strong compare to flavor of steak itself ham and cheese sandwich was too greasy really liked steak tartar as well as iberico pork and foie gras sliders deserts are well executed with really interesting presentation really liked lemon posset dessert as well as presentation
i would suggest to visit place once and see if it is your cup of tea although place is not cheap, had an awesome time

i was travelling alone but was made to feel very welcome and sat overlooking the kitchen service was friendly and attentive and everything i ate was delicious from start to finish

it was a real experience being able to watch the excellent chefs at work so arrive early theres no reservations so that you get the choice to sit here instead of at a table

the menu changes regularly but the octopus and the sea urchin dishes were both real highlights for me best overall meal i had in shanghai, we were a large group of about 20 people and the service was phenomenal best grilled cheese ive eaten in my entire life highly recommend, i went with a friend an we were seated at the bar with a view on the kitchen it was great to see the chefs cooking and enjoying their jobs food was awesome and the cocktails as well great place to go with 2 people as the bar seats are very nice with 4 people on the conversations might be difficult maybe there are also tables for 4 but you cant make a reservation so come early or late
cant wait untill spring when there is more seating outdoors on the patio, we arrived at 7pm as from previous reviews get there early to avoid disappointment there was no table available so we were ushered to the bar within 15 minutes we were ushered to the table which was one of the tables in the entrance this has to be my only criticism the 3 tables just as you go in clearly look like they were not meant to be their with low level lighting and the cold being right next to the door top tip would be make sure you do nothing t sit here out table was opposite the till

then there is the food top class as with anything jason atherton puts his name too to start we had pig head a potato croquettes much more mean stream than they sound and pickled smoked beats which were fresh and nutritious on the palate the star dish was the main we had steak with a fresh and zingy chim chimichurri lamb cutlets with the a deeply smoked aubergine puree

overall a 5 out 5 due to the 5 we even brought the kitchen beers which you can do from the menu but as many places in china the service was average with a lot of people not being the efficient

go if you get a chance, dropped in for lunch and we impressed with the menu and the service everything is extremely fresh and prepared to order presentation is superb water is refilled without question as was the hot lemon tea

the desserts were the highlight for us

perhaps a little pricey for lunch but worth it we will go back to try the dinner menu

love the simple but eclectic design of the space seems to go on for ever, great experience at commune social tapas style menu where casual meets fine dining one of my favorite restaurant in shanghai chef scott melvin renew his menu regularly with always delicate fusion of ingredients and texture wine menu propose a great selection of boutique wines to discover, i usually never review restaurants unless they would be fantastic and i would like to share it or poor and i would be so disappointed unfortunately it was the latter

we had been told by many friends it is such a fantastic place with wonderful sophisticated tapaslike food that we were very excited i even visited their great website something i rarely do to have a look at their menu

much of it was very greasy and tasteless chicken croquettes  caesar salad iberico cheese ham  quail egg truffle toastie grilled green peppers shallot dressing lemon we were four and not impressed by the food the wines were pretty general too so not impressed neither

it is a nicelooking place though and the service was really good but pricequalitywise way too expensive for the quality of what you get there are other spanish like places with tapas with less pretension and more taste, the first time i went there was for the hype jason atherton the former great executive chef working for gordon ramsay opening its second restaurant in shanghai i had to try the tapaswine bar ambiance makes eating there like sitting in an alcove place is small but space nicely used i like to sit at the kitchen bar and watch my food getting prepared or sit in the courtyard in spring for a brunch food is constantly good or excellent service is fine portion are not big so if youre hungry youre gonna chose wisely what you order and youre gonna pay for it but among many shanghai dining restaurants positioning themselves as cozy fining this is one of the best you can have forget the bund and its overrated restaurants and by the way id youre into ceramics and looking for a gift to take back home go check spin atelier a block away after your lunch, stopped by without a reservation for lunch no wait at all recommend sitting in the kitchen countertop seating surrounding the open kitchen great way to interact with the staff and watch our beautiful shared plates being prepared overall the meal was one of the best we had in shanghai well be back, very beautiful place in shanghai the staff is very nice and food is amazing highly recommend for lunch or to drink something in the cold winter if shanghai, one of my absolute favourite restaurants in shanghai and a perfect place to go with some friends or a date delicious tapas with a twist thanks to creative chef scott melvin and his crew, absolutely love this place atmosphere is great the food is sublime the cocktails are excellent service is top notch absolutely worth the wait if you cant get a table immediately, the advertising states that they didnt invest in the decor which is true is simple and minimalist which is a good thing because there is no room for much else other than tables and chairs if character is rated by the number of short stair ways small cramped rooms and dislocated space this place has a ton perhaps its better when its not raining and the outside spaces can be used

the commune social does not take reservations which is unique in shanghai so it causes one to ask why do they think they are that good is it so busy that their tables are always full all the time they only want couples and small groups we took a chance on our group of 6 arriving early 1830

the lady at the door explained that there were no tables available at this time she suggested that we wait in the bar and a table would be ready in 40 minutes some of our group had traveled 90 minutes and needed a drink so we waited

finally we were offered a seat at the open kitchen which is less than ideal for a group our size but we were getting hungry on our way downstairs we noticed that the all of the tables for two that had been empty when we arrived were no full some table had two people but others had been arranged together for groups of 6 or more these were people that arrived after us we know this because we saw the waiting list on arrival and we were the second name on the list the first name was crossed out

the food was like the decor was sparse and common the menu showed promise and had good selection it was difficult for some to understand and the staff were not ready to explain the dishes the chef had to step in to explain what to expect

overall the food was a good experience a good choice of flavour combinations and fitting presentations unfortunately we are unlikely to return because after driving through greater shanghai for more than an hour to reach this location we want to assured of a seat at a table and there doesnt seem to be a way to do this unless your in the right group, i cant say enough good things about commune social ive been there at least 10 times and it never disappoints food is great drinks are great bar tender is a rock star and the chef an artist get the diy tuna, i have been to this place nearly 10 times with friends family clients
it always hits the spot you have different area which brings different value my favourite is by the chefs open kitchen where you can see absolutely everything they cook and prepare for the guests
it is my favourite place in shanghai and i would recommend it highly , a friend brought me here and we sat at bar tables overlooking the kitchen the vibe was fun we enjoyed watching the chefs prepare different dishes and got to taste a few of them which was delicious wine selection was also extensive very happy she took me here, didnt realize theres this gem right near our apartment in the quiet side of jing an area decided to give it a try today for their brunch we arrived at around 1145am and therere already no seatings indoor except bar table near the kitchen we went out for the outdoor seatings and they got filled out quickly too the brunch menu was really creative less then rmb180 for 3 dishes and it comes with a soda or ice tea we enjoyed the eggs duck legs chicken and even the beef heart then we also tried their desserts lots of fun will definitely go again, the best western dinner in shanghai the ingredients are fresh  the concoction of herbscheese etc brings out the food in a refreshing manner love the lamb very juicy  tender

never had brocolinni hybrid of broccoli  chinese kai lan before till i was introduced to this cute restaurant they also have a bar  make good drinks

if you are tired of local food highly recommend this place ambience is good too enjoy sitting at the counter to watch the chef in action

they also have another tasting menu   you need to ask for it to check out other good food their sorbet is outstanding must try

note portion is small so its great to order more variety to taste different types of food, first the place it a bit hard to find our cab driver was confused and dropped us a block away easy to miss the small sign

we we sat on the bar overlooking the kitchen chef table and were very happy with the experience its great to see workers happy and hustling to serve nice youthful energy all around most diners and servers in their 20s30s

i cant speak much to the value since i didnt pick up the bill but the menu looked to be daily high for tapas portions

food we had the ribeye excellent but a splurge at $40 us octopus sashimi flavorful spanish chicken favorite bbq corn also excellent and some manchego cheese the cheese was softer and not so salty as i like but the anchovy butter helped give it some pop

only dings were a loud door that kept slamming behind me and some jerk on the patio thought it cool to smoke a cigar which drifted in and out also we sat on the corner near a speaker that was way way to loud finally i agree with the other reviewers about the menu being hard to read

ambience 4, every time we visit shanghai we book at the commune social the food is imaginative brilliantly presented and never disappoints a brilliant chef hopefully training a new generation of chefs in china service is relaxed friendly and diligent try the desert bar for a treat at the end of the meal, this restaurant is one of the best and most reasonably priced restaurants considering the quality and taste of the dishes the food was all amazing takes on classic flavours with a modern edge not only this but it is incredibly beautifully presented and the bar is outstanding bar manager stanislas and his team created amazing cocktails that started the night off perfectly i can see this would be a great place to visit just for drinks and a snack perfect for first date, very nice place with both indoor and outdoor tables great food tapas style and good wine list the dishes are amazing good service a little expensive for what you really get, great cocktails if you go with multiple people be sure to try them all they are very creatively put together, we picked up this restaurant due to some recommendations at the end of the dinner the experience was not quite as expected

we visited the place on saturday night and as per policy they had space for us even if bookings are not accepted unluckily shanghai sky was raining cats and dogs so we couldnt enjoy the obviously empty garden or yard area which looks very appealing

interesting design and use of space of an old chinese construction like a chain of rooms and space which you can enjoy depending on your luck we were seated in a small room on the second floor which could have provided privacy for a bigger team of diners but in our case there were altogether three different groups a bit noisy room finally with too small tables so that caucasian legs couldnt really fit under the table also the room was so packed with tables that when people were going for toilet cigarette and so on or the waitresses serving the tables we were continually disturbed with our dining experience

if you have bad ankles or other physical problems or if you are tipsy avoid the more challenging areas in the restaurant space as there are a lot of chances to get hurt if you for some reason fall down on the uneven flooring or number of staircases

service was a bit poor eg with careless splashes of red wine on the table also as per policy food comes as it gets ready in our case as we didnt share the dishes as suggested the food was served so that when somebody was already finishing another one just started

menu looks interesting even if the text font used is too small for almost everybody i dont need glasses everyday but yet had a little bit of difficulty to read it

food was tasty yet nothing special a bit pricy too for the portions you get the menu recommends to go for sharing but if you do so prepare to order several portions of each dish as they really are very small a big disappointment for me was that there was no plain bread with the cheese platter even after request bisquits and oily warm garlic bread was served instead

drinks menu is covering to great extend except if you like beer only two items in the offering and also with rather expensive prices

value for money 2, went to this place with a family visitor from the us we were seated outdoor in a nice spot but there was no light so it was impossible to read the menu and even worse we didnt see what we ate
service was confusing dishes came out quickly one after the other so there was enough place on the table and when we asked for s knife it took them few minutes and repeat reminders to get it
the bare meet and salmon tar tar were excellent the lamb was just a piece of fat a piece that you dont expect in such a place
tomato salad chicken and desert were all good
all in all much less than expected and we didnt get the value for money we expected, had a lovely food here on a sunny day sat in the courtyard arrived early and joined the line so that we would get a table when it opened its doors at 12

food was excellent great flavours and textures and lots of small pates to share so everyone got to try everything

the one downside was the service when we asked for someone to take our order we got a very abrupt and rude no wait wait wait as he walked over to another table that had just sat down to take their order  we were then ignored till everyone else in the area had had both drinks and food orders and food was being delivered to their tables

fortunately we had not time constrained so still managed to enjoy our lunch, super chill spot very well designed and concepted the food is outrageous just every morsel you want more i cant get enough of this place the patio is awesome and so is the dessert bar seating area going to miss this place when i leave shanghai, after hearing and reading so many great reviews about the place it was definitely on my must go list finally made it there last week and it most definitely was one of the biggest letdowns ever

on arrival we were seated very quickly in the courtyard with the menu and a friendly smile that was the end of the friendly service we waited for a good 10 minutes and there was still no service not even an offer of a drink i had to get someones attention just to get the drinks menu

food was below average not what you would expect from such a reputable place the drinks were watered down the risotto was just rice and stock the french fries were soggy need i say more, if you know food if its a passion then this is a place for you chef scott melvin is a lionel messi of the kitchen flair  flamboyance  but with real purpose he cares about the full experience and its not for show high quality ingredients and combinations to bring out the best a menu so broad that there is something for everyone with compromise

the venue itself is full of intrigue with nooks and crannies for intimate seclusion right through to the pitchside bar with full view of the kitchen staff rosie has all the moves one of shanghais stand out dining experiences, lunch with friend and we had excellent dish after dish the tea came in an really nice cup too excellent quality make up for a little bit expensive casual dining with a few friends works good here i will return, we have been at the commune social already for afternoon tapas but last weekend we made it to have dinner
sometimes can be hard as they don<u+00b4>t take reservations

however it is worth to wait for a table the service is really good and if you compare it to most of the upperclass restaurants in shanghai even outstanding

we loved the tapas creations and one of the favourites was definitely the pork and foie gras burgermouth watering

the setting with the little courtyard is great

we will come again and to try the other half of the menu
maybe not the ribeye again as i have to say that price and quality may lack a little bit don<u+00b4>t get me wrong it<u+00b4>s still good but there are better places for steaks in shanghai, it had been a few months since i last had dinner at this lovely place i always try to get there early so i can get a seat by the kitchen at the back of the restaurant scott exec chef was once again at the helm ensuring the quality and timelyiness of the dishes we had sea urchin pulled lamb cauliflower and broccoli dishes all of which were tasty and beautifully presented difficult to choose a highlight but the pork and foie gras burgers would be right up there the front of house manager and sommelier complete a great senior team who have strong local talent to back them up the format here is a sharing deal choose three dishes between two and then keep ordering single dishes until you have had your fill sad to be leaving shanghai  scott thank you for for looking after us and your teams great food, good addition to the dining scene in shanghai friendly service good atmosphere and good food great dessert options in sensible portions the bar upstairs is worth trying as well with a fantastic terrace

the table for 4 was too small for 4 so whilst that is not a huge problem it does mean tat it can be a little cramped

food prices are not over the top but the drink prices are high, we wanted to like commune social came on a friday evening and even with the noreservation policy we immediately got ourselves a table in the courtyard it was a balmy spring evening and the restaurant was filling up

when we were ready to order from the menus already at the table it took 10 minutes of repeated calling out for a servers attention for one to stop by and when one did he merely plopped the daily specials menu and drinks list on our table and walked away why not offer all menus at once and of course we had to try hard to catch a servers attention once again after we browsed the specials not a great start

we ordered 2 drinks and 4 dishes to share between two of us the salt and pepper calamari with squid ink aioli was bland the fries with rosemary garlic was fragrant but the ingredients did not meld sufficiently the fried cauliflower with confit egg yolk had a creamy flavor and contrasting textures that we would love to have more of yes portions were small the tongue and cheek beef empanada was deliciously buttery yet tangy in short the food was passable  some highlights yet somewhat forgettable

time for dessert we requested for the dessert menu and once again it took multiple tries before we could get a server to pay us any attention we finally put in our order and waited and waited and waited

about 25 minutes transpired when we asked a server to check on our order a staff who looked to be a manager then came to us to apologize that our order was lost and mumbled about having staffing issues we were quite annoyed at this point given the poor service wed experienced all night we asked him for the bill instead and when it came we realized there was an additional item on it that we had not ordered told the manager right away and to our surprise instead of checking with us or his team on what we consumed his response was that they have 2 cauliflower dishes on their menu we responded that we only had one of them only to get a baffling and rather rude answer that he did not take our order he came by again with the corrected bill when we asked for the official invoice as is common practice in china we were told the invoice machine is broken of course they offered to mail it to us

on our way out the manager apologized and asked us to return so he can make up for the poor evening which honestly sounds too much like a canned response in the service industry today

our thoughts the dining scene in shanghai is highly competitive tapas or otherwise at this price point and given its fame and hype we expected so much more from commune social being understaffed is one thing but we feel what commune social lacks is not a few more pairs of hands but heart we would not be returning, we had heard very good things about this restaurant and so decided to try it the setting was very nice and the food was good but we were not blown away by the experience we had to wait a little while for the food having said that we did enjoy everything we ordered, every dish was delectable fresh produce creative pairings on each plate
we gobbled every dish without speaking too engrossed in the flavours
decent wine and cocktail selection
no service charge rare in this city
they dont need it waiters tipped well dye to great food and service
love jason never fails to please no matter which country you are in, the commune social never disappoints the food is full of flavors and the menu creative the tapas concept is great to taste many dishes my favorites are the scallop ceviche sea urchins and mini burgers i will for sure go there again, commune social never dissapoints vivitted several times food and cocktails always excellent tapas style no booking so arrive early arrived at openining time on a friday night and got the last seats sit at the counter and warch the food being prepared, visited commune and sat in the kitchen bar with full view of the kitchen action the food was really great and we ordered about 3 courses per person to share the wine menu is moderate to good the service and hospitality is really great they have a bar one level up which really produces great drinks a restaurant definitely worth a visit, had lunch with a friend there today and still cannot get over how delicious this meal was chef and owner scott also owner of table no 1 another of my favorite restaurants in shanghai and his wife kim the pastry chef make a powerful combination in this restaurant
dishes are tapas size and are suggested to be shared we had chorizo and poached egg with sweet tomatoes roasted beets with burrata and ginger crackers brussels sprouts cauliflower with walnuts poached eggs with bacon jelly and mushroom mousse of some sort for dessert they served complimentary caramel corn that was iced with nitrogen so fun as you pop the caramel corn in your mouth there is smoke coming out of your mouth we finished off with cherry clafoutis and ricotta with strawberries
delicious delicious delicious absolutely everything was excellent cooking techniques are modern with unusual combination of ingredients and the use of nitrogen for ingredients on several dishes i cannot wait to return
the restaurant does not take reservations unfortunately and that has been a deterrent for me returning with business associates in the past you can sit at the bar where the chef cooks in the back in an open kitchen tip is to get there before 8 in order to get a table at the chef bar
if you are looking for a culinary adventure this is your place, they do have great food tapas style and very creative and tasty however everything is overpriced and the service could not do them justice either
they dont take reservation but its worth to visit for a fancy night out the dessert menu is amazing, really good food and wine as advertised we went early evening saturday and it was busy as expected rather than wait for a table or at the upstairs bar also full we ate at the downstairs diner bar which was fine cozy and tight with nice lighting and very attentive staff we enjoyed the whole evening then bumped into 6 friends on the way out you wont be disappointed, was this week the first time in the commune social what an amazing place great tasty cocktails very attendive staff and more excellent food and wine selection
can recommend it only

only drawback that they dont except reservations, ive been here many times so i am writing my second review based on high performing consistency had a lunch set here that really blew my mind such a very high standard does not take bookings which is good  keep it up guys feel welcomed from the moment you step in the door, the experience in this restaurant was absolutely magnificent we almost missed the place first because it is only very narrow from the street and the name is not very big although it looks small the restaurant actually goes on towards the back we came at around 7 oclock on a friday night so we had no wait to get a table but it was packed about half an hour later

the food and drinks were spectacular and they were tapas size and nice to share some of our favorites were the iberico pork and foie gras mini burgers the soft shell crab and the mozzarella salad save room for dessert

although it was quite expensive it was worth every rmb and we will definitely be back, a really well run bistro bar at the time of visiting with international standard cuisine and service a fun atmosphere where ambiance and cuisine are both equally goodsometimes a rarity in this city, an adventure for the senses very fun and casual had some great cocktails to begin the night off had some great tapas and the dessert was the highlight really friendly staff nice casual and fun experience, arguably the commune social is one of the restaurants that has made jingan an increasingly good  and cool place for western style cuisine similar to table no 1 the design is simply and contemporary with the greater focus of good ingredients and delicious food i have dined here in both summer and autumn and am happy to say the menu does change perhaps indicating the chef has the ability to consistently delight the diners tastebuds staff are knowledgeable and friendly food beautifully presented and delicious tapas style portions makes sharing easy so you can sample multiple dishes good options for omnivores and pescatarians","Chinese cuisine",0.437753375878824
45,"have been here several times and the food is consistently good

the vibe of this place as a great local place where the staff know regulars by name is something that has pleasantly evolved since the last time i ate here

great lunch off of a new menu today excellent service and a hip vibe makes me wish i lived a coupe streets away instead of across town, pass through a wooden door into modern classy style restaurant with attentive staff western fusion menu went in couple shared for starter a ham platter served with a a few vegees 168 rmb some french fries and ordered for mains a confit of lamb topped with brown sauce and grilled lobster 188 rmb each ended with their dessert platter 138 rmb five items staff coming often to empty your mineral water bottle into your glass total approx 1000 rmb including glass of wine culinary wise my lady and me agreed that dessert creme caramel well done meringue with chantilly and fruit topping was what we would remember other clients were ordering their good looking pizza probably worth trying families and couples, had a great brunch here last sunday the service was great and food delicious and reasonably priced the waitress even combined our drinks into the drinks deal to save us some money without us asking her to highly recommend it looking forward to the warmer weather to enjoy the outdoor area, we came for the set menu and it was delicious i had the lamb shank and it was lovely and melted right off the bone the sauce was perfection and the size was just right i also had the greek salad and it was perfection i havent had a good greek salad since i left the states ill definitely be back, the food at husk is really nice but i love the passion fruit martinis the service is excellent and we always enjoy the relaxed and homey atmosphere the staff is really friendly and very professional as i said always a pleasure to go to husk, located on a back street close to the busy shopping street of nanjing xi road this restaurant is a lovely respite from the hustle and bustle of the area it has a great happy hour and delicious lunch dinner and brunch menus we live in the area and can always count on a delicious meal the hostess always makes us feel especially welcome it is our goto place when we want a nice dinner but dont want to stray to far from our neighborhood, after reading all of the glowing reviews of this place and seeing the lovely photos of the environment i decided to try this place with a group out on business i used the link to their online reservations and made a reservation for after 9 pm on a sunday with tables only being open after 9 i thought we were looking at a restaurant that would be full we showed up early and the place was close to empty we truly would have preferred to eat earlier i started with a mojito the presentation was very nice the metal straw with the heart on the end although cute was completely impractical as it constantly clogged with the tiny crushed ice it was really difficult to tell if there was a drink or just ice in a cup i ordered the pork tenderloin the presentation was nice and the serving generous especially for shanghai the pork although tender was quite dry the sauce on the side was waaaay too bitter for my liking to make matters worse this dish was served luke warm the grilled vegetables barely had grill marks and did not taste grilled i finished maybe half of the dish and had enough two of my guests split a roast fish and both commented that the fish was just ok and far too salty for their liking one guest ordered the mussel appetizer it looked delicious but she commented they were tasteless i tried one and agree that they were very bland as for the atmosphere there really was a huge difference between the photos and the actual restaurant the decor was far from special the patio tables overlook a beat up street i personally would not want an outdoor table here service was good and attentive as i went through other options in shanghai with similar style food i came to the conclusion there were really far too many misses here for me to choose husk over other options, went to husk a few times in the last 2 years went back twice recently for sunday tea the last visit was yesterday and we really enjoyed the atmosphere this time new manager whore very warm and nice we ordered 2 snacks cheese and 2 mini burger and a tea set baked plum tart all the food were really good will definitely go back again as the price is reasonable too, with all the pleasant reviews i thought i need to give it another try since my first experience wasnt up to the mark this time i came with family and we had a larger selection of dishes all nice well cooked tasty but not healthy but occasionally i feel like ordering all these heavy treats like deep fried calamari eggs benedict with sauce hollandaise battered chunks of chicken deep fried it was wonderful and it made me skip dinner i am sure we could have ordered some lighter dishes but shanghai is getting cold and damp now so a bit of speck under the skin cannot hurt
draft beer from brugge is excellent 3 different types and each one is served in its special glass very nice i will come back and try the other dishes too service is pleasant atmosphere is good interior design very nice exterior seating a bit odd, was in shanghai for a business trip over the weekend and walked pass this unmissable restaurant  husk did not expect the salad was so delicious and i ordered a mojito which comes with a special straw with a lovely heart shape spoon at the end of the metal straw feeling the restaurant got beautiful designs in every small thing desserts are nice too must try

all staff were extremely attentive friendly and helpful a restaurant suitable for solo or a group of people would definitely go again, the cozy restaurant is great because of their food but also due to their service the people are extremely friendly service minded and willing to help as a vegetarian they really tried to think with me what to offer i like the atmosphere and will definitely come back, of course the husk restaurant is not the cheapest but the food is very tasty and the waiters very attentive the brunch menu is full of meat but you can easily ask for a vegetarian friendly dish there is also a free flow option for alcoholic drinks for a reasonable price, we came across husk while planning to go to a different destination for a weekend lunch date and we were pleasantly surprised we stayed although a bit off the busier streets husk is certainly worth a visit the staff was very attentive and sophisticated in their service the atmosphere was not at all too loud and had a lowlit warmth to it i enjoyed the malbec and porkcheeseolive platter to begin never felt hurried along by our waitress as she held our mains salmon was fantastic until we were ready for next course no complaints look forward to returning, yesterday we had dinner at this lovely and warm place which all of us loved  westerners and french food and wine were great service was efficient and caring a hidden place to discover, visited for lunch with my husband and 2 boys 9 and 12 a bit tricky to find but once there we were made welcome by the waitress who spoke good english food is generally western and theres also a decent kids menu i had a gorgeous burger my eldest son had a lamb wrap my husband had the pork and my youngest had the kids pasta we also had some gorgeous artisan bread and houmous i was particularly impressed with the kids pasta which was hearty with a rich tomato sauce cherry tomatoes and hamour son totally cleared the plate the chocolate and caramel dessert was the only part which let it down due to the over cooked chocolate fondant which had sunk in the middle other than that would definitely recommend, with all these exciting reviews i was expecting better food it was good but nothing to write home about maybe i ordered the wrong dishes or the cook was on vacation
i had a caesar salad and fish  chips simple things that could be delicious
the salad had a creamy somewhat sweet marinade while i was expecting salty anchovies garlic grated italian cheese in it no it was not bad but not a crispy and salty salad
the fish  chips wasnt good but i was hungry and not in the mood to discuss i will order something different next time i got 3 chunks of fish battered and deep fried fried too long very hard shell around an overcooked fish different kinds of fish which is nice the fries had a spicy powder coating that wasnt to my taste
presentation is nice and service is top yes the beer also excellent from brugge belgium draft beer the setting is very nice with a little outdoor seating
other clients were all chinese so maybe the cook adjusted the meat expectations not sure i will go again and update my review, excellent food at inexpensive prices with excellent service had grilled fish with duck salad both delicious and well prepared at bargain prices, the hosting was amazing and the food as well delicious
next time in shanghai i have to go to husk again, warm atmosphere service excellent the meat was perfectly cooked rare to find that in shanghai they have a set menu for lunch and evening is a nice place to go in couple if i had to find some defaults i would say a little pricy and the large room is a somehow noisy with other tables a bit too close, after dinner we try now brunch also is very good quality and perfect service the dishes are in good size and it tast very good i can recommend without restrictions for sunday brunch is good to have a reservation, if you would like to spend pleasant time away from the bustle of the city and enjoy tasty food this place on little quite street for you the choice of food is very interesting each person can find something suitable for himself if you tired from some common food this place can offer unusual delicious meals amazing by its taste the meal serving very good always want to make photo of such food it looks very appetizing service is very attentive and friendly very good special price offers for brunches i will visit this place one more time for sure

then to top if off one of the ownersmanagers came over and greeted us and gave us some very personalized service and attention

it was just a few minute walk from the 2line at nanjing xi lui highly recommend it my wife and son and i really enjoyed it, i have come to husk three times and each time i am more than satisfied with the food and the service the restaurant has friendly staff that make sure all your needs are met  especially yustina as she goes above and beyond to ensure the dining experience has been exceptional the brunch deals are at a reasonable price and the dishes are cooked to perfection the happy hour wine is superb better than majority of the other house wines in shanghai

we will definitely be coming back again, hard to find because located in a very calm street husk is a fine dining restaurant who makes you forget the neighborhood
great ambiance  great food  good service 
perfect for dates or lounge oriented dinner 
their homemade bread is just divine 
nice cocktails and great choices of food 
only minus is that its a bit pricey
a must try  at least , we had a business lunch the service was good and fast the food tasty after all the price is reasonable and the quality in secured, had great time on weekend here thanks to staff for smiles care and quick service my glass of water was never empty big and delicious oysters impressed me much bcs of fresshess aftertaste and size very floppy  wine that sommelier recommended us was very suitable to all dishes we had thanks a lot will come back soon for sure, this restaurant is in a small parallel street of nanjing road
you can eat inside but also outside it is nice since there are only bike traffic
we had an amazing hummus and small burgher and it seems to come back to the mesa manifesto the old local of the owner charlie
they have good salad and meat
the mojito was superlative, charlie and his team did a great job as usual i invited 10 of my business friends and we had a wonderful evening food and service were great  keep up the standard and i will be back , through a friends recommendation i organized a team event consists of about 40+ people it was really a last minute request but i am utterly impressed with michael one of the owner and his team was able to pull this off really well
venue the location is at the heart of jingan area michael also reserved a combination of indoor and outdoor section to allow 40+ people who wants to have a bit of open aircigarette time as well as sitdown dinner since it is a rainy season michael and his team also prepared huge umbrellas just in case of rain very thoughtful
food and drink i specifically ask for food to be served at different section to allow people to sitdown for food as well as standing to allow people to walk around for social conversations perfect for a social event the food is so tasty and my colleague has been thinking about next event at husk

with certainly come again, i have consistently enjoyed the food atmosphere and service at husk i have visited multiple times and have experienced everything from a cup of tea to steak and seafood on the menu everything has been excellent i am a vibe type of person and the atmosphere is perfect for doing business to just hanging out with friends the courtyard is peaceful and provides a nice escape to the busy shanghai world the service has been the best ive experienced in shanghai upon my first visit yustina restuarant supervisormanager smiled and introduced herself gave me the lunch specialeven though i had conversed through the allotted time frame and served us the meal herself as ive experienced the management and staff at husk ive noticed that nothing is beyond anyones scope in the name of service their team functions flawlessly to provide a wonderful dining experience on a recent visit one of the managing partners charlie introduced himself and shared insight about the food and service if you decide to enjoy the wonderful food and service at husk i guarantee that you will enter the restaurant as a customer and leave as a personal friend, we enjoyed a great lunch deal at husk this afternoon 2 courses for 108rmb and a very delicious mocktail delighted to see so many choices on the menu  i opted for a fresh and light nicoise salad followed by roast chicken and couscous salad perfect for a balmy day in shanghai service was excellent water glasses frequently topped up and very friendly staff well done to the husk team, the ambient is good and it is a good place to hold business lunches prices are not high service is smooth and the food does not fall behind the restaurant also has a small terrace facing the street that might be interesting for people looking for an endofday beer, i dropped in to grab something really fast that i could take back to my meeting and was pleasantly surprised at how they assisted me in making a good selection and providing it quickly i enjoyed the food but was more impressed with the way i was treated service is sometimes more important than the product

i will for sure return and sample more dishes, excellent from the start very attentive staff and pretty too to greet and take you to your table hi quality food at normal shanghai expat prices but well worth it went for a variety of appetizers all without flaws what was remembered is the flank steak  spectacular and a reason to come back  thank you anook and charlie , recently had an awesome lunch w my friend on husk`s open terrace pleasant ambience and really tasty main courses my personal recommendation beef burger medium by the way they know what means medium salmon salad and kiwi cucumber smoothie that is included into set didn`t understand why they put price into list, i have been there alone on a hot summer day like we have un shanghai and i had a great experience located in a quiet street of the city center it is perfect for an affordable but exquisite lunch or dinner the service was nice and fast will go back there for sure  5 stars , when you walk into husk you find a comfortable open atmosphere with gentle lighting and colors very comfortable seating with tables well spaced and a nice outdoor seating area the menu is eclectic with some delicious options overall good value for money and attentive service with an owner that is very often there, i dont usually like fusion but husk food is just amazing recommended both for business and private occasions , i have been to husk many times lunch and dinner it never disappoints it is always a pleasure especially in a city full of more expensive restaurants which often let you down

i thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there last night with friends luckily i had booked ahead as it was very busy but ana and her team did a great job the service was excellent as usual they have changed the menu a bit since my last visit which was nice

we had steak and the salmon for mains and a fig pie desert which was ridiculously good drinks prices are very reasonable for this city good martinis as well plus they now have a pretty decent happy hour

i seriously recommend this spot for lunch or dinner with friends the location is very good as well just up from nanjing west road around the corner from westgate mall shanghai traffic can be awful so having somewhere like husk nearby is great for me

dont forget to book ahead especially at weekends but it is well worth it i love this place, great location the restaurant has a nice friendly vibe  service is excellent food is decadent  mediterranean spiced dishes and some chinese influence in some other dishes fresh and succulent taste makes them all unique surely a place to come back to very often love it you will often see the owner working the room and chatting with his guest, one of shanghais best kept secrets great sharing plates you can try a bit of everything amazing chicken pie and the desert platter is a must, cool place  affordable prices and extremely good service
dishes are good and served in a very addictive way you want to eat them once you saw whats on your plate
quick service
bartender was very smiling and open to public maybe he is the one who will do the best cocktails in shanghai
will be back asap as i get back to china, youre night is completely taken care of from the moment you walk in the door right to the very end when someone assists you to put your coat on and wishes you a good night its in a convenient downtown area easy to find and with a few different sections to the restaurant can cater for intimate evening through to business dinners the staff at husk are attentive and very helpful when it comes to recommendations  it really made the night try the pork shoulder and chicken pot pie the sesame salmon and duck were also winners the dessert sampler got a huge nod from all of us overall a great dining experience this is the second visit ive made and i will definitely be back, as you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting the luxuries of modernitysitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshoplike kitchen where you can see the chefs workingthe menu offers a wide variety of mouthwatering dishesall the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of homemade food the chefs takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients the restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the regioneverything is absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation very pleasingthe best thing is the location of the restaurant which is in the heart of the city of shanghai ","Chinese cuisine",0.999850064260159
46,"we used to live in the same compound as this restaurant and it saved me during my pregnancy i went there all the time for my crazy craving pizza and pasta the are very good at accommodating all my requests
its also a great place for a romantic date it has a great menu with all sorts of italian dishes and a good selection of wines
highly recommend, small location but easy to find the restaurant offer roman specialities almost free of chinese influence bruschetta and pizza were really very good pizza roma style so very thin personnel is friendly and can speak good english and even italian good for dinner with friends romantic dinner and for desperate italian that needs pasta andor pizza , very cozy restaurant as you walk in you can smell the bread baking and the bread is very yummy couldnt get enough the staff are so welcoming and make you feel right at home i still cant believe i found such amazing food in shanghai i felt like i was in italy while dinning at the restaurant the pizza was amazing the lamb chops were delicious  desserts are to die for, we dined here several times while in shanghai the service was great the food was amazing this might very well be my most favorite restaurant in the world tiramisu was on point as was all the other things we had including pizza lamb bruschetta etc id come back just to eat here again, after reading the reviews and arriving at the restaurant gave me a bit of high hopes and expectations

the place is really cozy and the staff is very kind but the quality and quantity of the food and drinks werent the greatest and a bit over priced in general

the bread was dry and old but after requesting fresh bread we got some other which was luckily fresh and tasty, a little bit of italy in shanghai fantastic pizzas and salad  would highly recommend and ask for a table outside if you dont mind on first floor and a little bit of road noise to feel like you are in shanghai would definitely go back, thought wed try something we had never had in shanghaiitalian
we were pleasantly surprised on arrival we were greeted by an italian speaking chinese woman who seated us and the waiter was italian which i thought was great unlike the last reviewer
we started with the caprese salad and plain pizza
the salad was delicious and the pizza light and crispy then for main course we had a pasta and tomato and mozzarella pizza the dough for me was perfect really light and crispy i enjoyed 2 glasses of sangiovese as well the whole experience was great a lovely place that i highly recommend if you feel like an italian meal in shanghai, more and more restaurants in shanghai you visit today will you find a foreigner caucasian waiting at your table this one is included

why more and more overseas culinary entrepreneur are finding china a lucrative market could be one major reason but i sometime cant help but wonder could it be some local restauranteur playing some marketing trick by putting someone alien up front in a restaurant so as to create a programmed image that this is a place of premium quality and of authenticity so much so that they can command a premium price whichever the case whichever nationality they are service industry is service industry and people working in this industry should know what service industry is all about

the dining experience last night at palatino roman cuisine could have been an applauding one but what made it turn sour was nothing but service itself

fair enough the place pretty much lived up to the many good reviews found here that the kitchen was good we had beef carparciao and bruschetta to start off they were good then grill lamb a pizza and a pasta for the mains pizza was super good pasta was nice the lamb was ok in short no qualm about the food served

what really lacking here was service and friendly service

after i was ushered to my table and given the drink and food menu i was left unattended for as long as 15 or 20 minutes no one foreigner or local waiter ever attempted to come forward to take order for drink or food or just to offer tap water worst of all was that throughout that many minutes all servers did nothing but just stand on the side and giving me empty and meaningless glares from time to time

this was not a good beginning but the worst had yet to come

the food while it was good came out at staggering but awkward time the appetizer came out not too soon yet not too late but at a reasonable time the pizza also came after a reasonable pause and probably you would expect the other main dishes would also come out at about the same time no it didnt it came out almost 40 to 50 minutes after

yes there must have been some fault in the kitchen but what was annoying was that the staff on the serving front here didnt seem to care much after waiting for the pasta and the meat for almost half an hour we asked the caucasian staff without checking with the kitchen  he replied promptly that it was being prepared inside taking his words we waited and waited for a further 1015 minutes with no food in sight we asked again but directing our enquiry to a local staff this time she also replied promptly saying the food was being prepared without again consulting the kitchen and the food still didnt come until a further 10 minutes

all along ever since the first checking with the staff about the food he never came over to offer explanation even though he looked at us and knowing that our table was empty and that we were looking at him with yearning eyes

when the food finally came a simple short brief cold and straightforward apology for serving late did come from him but not any more no reason given no excuse said cool

however by all accounts i do not think this was apologetic enough i do not think he really cared whether our food was served late or for how long it was over due

staff here do not have much words they do not not bother to greet you to explain to you the menu to make you feel comfortable and if you think caucasian would be more outward out going more incline to approaching guests and customer not here indeed staff here do not ward smile on their faces and all here were so sober and cool that i found them truly unfriendly and a bit snobbish

i know places like hong kong and new york city has never been a friendly town but i didnt know shanghai has become so advance that not only has many restaurants are own run and served by foreigners but the service has also become so metropolitan that they are so bland and so uncomfortable

dont really like this place, one of my favorite places to eat in shanghai very good service i can recommend the little restaurant for lunch and dinner, great food great wines good service casual atmosphere in a small place but do not miss it you will be treated well try the paccheri cacio e pepe, as my wife and daughter sadly dont eat chinese food we were very pleased to find an excellent italian restaurant in the french concession area you would have thought that palatino was in rome itself quality dishes with no concession to being in china we had a very nice italian red wine with the meal that was good value too very enjoyable, after two weeks of chinese food the desire to use a knife and fork again overwhelmed us so after some internet searching we chose palantino more in hope than expectation that they could produce a good pizza the lead chef turned out to be italian and the pizza was one of the best we have has for a long time it was thin crust naples style and made with quality ingredients in particular the ham i recently spent a week in rome and could not find a pizza as good despite following recommendations from a roman excolleague pizzas were reasonably priced by shanghai standards at around 100 yuan for desserts we had an equally excellent tiramisu i had a single serving of italian ice cream which was pitifully small for the price paid and the only disappointment of the evening

the service was excellent all staff members had excellent english and a professional manner it is also well situated in the stylish french concession district the restaurant was busy but not full so booking may be advisable although not necessary, i was reluctant to go to an italian restaurant in china thinking that the food would not be great but my calabrese pizza was better than any ive had in london or rome it had very thin and crispy dough and just the right amount of tomato mozzarella salami and olives and was delicious if this was my local restaurant in london i would happily eat there every week, great authentic italian in the center of shanghai french consession not far from the huahai road super italian food antipasti pizza and pasta i had the palatino penne which was just super very friendly service with italian waiters we will come back when in the neighbourhood, we had a nice time at palatino good food and good vine nice atmosphere and good service nice place to have dinner with friends, oh man who would have thought wed find authentic italian pizza in shanghai it was delicious also the meat and cheese is sliced on sight to order the wine list was very good and if you are looking for recommendations ask the server who just arrived from italy he was wonderful a perfect beginning to our evening shenanigans at a great midpriced ristorante it made the whole family happy, authentic italian menu with plenty of appetizers and excellent pizzas no separate kids menu available but waiter kindly proposed to customize pizza so that suitable for children

location on google maps doesnt match the real location as of 042016 it is off 15 km and has actually different italian restaurant, i was struggling quite some time weather i should give a 4 or 5 star rating why is that

we went there yesterday and enjoyed a pizza with appetizer and a glass of wine after living in shanghai for 4 years we have tried quite a few italian restaurants here and i am really convinced we found the best pizza in town the quality was amazing the price absolutely right the carppaccio out of this world the service to just right nothing to complain here

but why after all the praise would i think about giving only four stars a glass of house wine almost 60 rmb which tasted alright was filled very  thrifty  is that the word  into the glass my own fault i should have complained right away that was the first time ever that i saw a glass of wine with so little wine  this place claiming to be an authentic italian restaurant didnt offer a drink like a grappa or limoncello on the house now do i have the right to insist on such a thing

no but its the small things that make the big difference

the antipasti plate was in my very own opinion overpriced and not really my taste

i very strongly recommend this restaurant you will probably find the best pizza in shanghai go there and experience it yourself  i will certainly give it another try, an italian island in the middle of shanghai had a good spaghetti carbonara and an excellent tiramisu and service was perfect a place to go back to, amazing italian restaurant for when you need a break from chinese food had dinner as it was close to my hotel and decided to go back on my next trip real italian food and good value for money, every time ive been to palatino ive enjoyed my meal theyve got fresh ingredients and deliver tasty versions of italian classics consistently and with good service its spread out over three floors so its not crammed or overly noisy�perfect for a meal with friends a date a celebration

its not the trendiest decor nor are they cooking up avantgarde cuisine but they know what theyre offering and they do it well the menu has an excellent range of dishes from pizzas and pastas to meats and fish the wine list is basic though sensible

everything is reasonably priced even a bit of a value compared to what some other western  italian places in shanghai charge and especially for the neighbourhood i look forward to every visit, service was bad since it took forever to bring us our 2 pizzas plus when we arrived and asked to sit outside in a table of 4 they said you are only 2 so better to give it to a group of more people but then 2 chinese came and they gave it to them since they would spend more food was nothing special but expensive can find much better pizza in shanghai way cheaper, yes the owner is italian but the food is not like what we are used from italy

rather expensive for the quality

but friendly service and a good choice of artisanal italian beers, our favorite address in shanghai we are going there at least once a month and never regret it pasta beef tuna pizza everything is greatly cooked and served with smile, as other reviewers have mentioned the food incredibly fresh presentation good and portions more than generous service warm attentive without being obtrusive the proprietor really sets the tone it is his space and one really doesnt feel that outside is the noise and cacophony of shanghai we are long term residents of shanghai already 27+ years so we love to discover authentic cuisine with owners that take pride in what they offer we tried both vegetable and mushroom soups~ both delicious ordered a calabrese pizza that hands down my husband son and i all thought amazing crispy thin crust very fresh ingredients and two of the pastas carbonara and my son ordered a recommended dish which had truffles in it both pastas incredibly rich but it was a freakishly cold night so somehow those choices seemed appropriate we finished with the profiteroles a perfect two bites of creamy delicious pastry with a slightly bitter dark chocolate drizzled on the top  absolutely amazing prices are not inexpensive but they are in line with the quality of food and location only drawback is the hellish search for parking anywhere in the vicinity old jinjiang hotel offers some spots if you are early enough people using metro its an easy walk from line 11210 shaanxi road stop and just behind the garden hotel signage easy to pick out, its was a great surprise this restaurant where you can meet people from everywhere 
we start with the linguine delicious  the wine was very good and after trying the tiramisu  after that you can die because your last dinner was amazing
the waiters offer us the limoncello 
good address is shanghai to speak spanish or italian or english and few words in french, i need to come here at least once per week incredible pizza and amazing pasta served by wonderful people in a great atmosphere this place has been one of my absolute favourite restaurant in shanghai now for a long time and i definitely will keep coming, a couple of weeks ago we had been at palatino for the first time it is a small but well accommodated and warmly decorated place which let you fell a bit italia abroad
the food was very good and above average compared to other italian restaurants in shanghai
we had the cold cuts as a starter and pizza for the main dish both were really tasty
the only drawback were the wine glasses red wine should be served in big red wine glasses instead of those standard ones they also use for white wine as well as the amount served should fit the price per glass
however we always love to come back since overall it is always a pleasant and tasty experience, nice restaurant very tasty service very quicly we eat spaghetti vongole e pizza 4 stagioni was all grate i will came back sure, one of the best italian restaurants in shanghai with great wines

became pretty regulars her as the location is very convenient and the food is always perfect in shanghai you often have big differences when it comes to quality and when you eat there but this one never fails always very happy to come here, this restaurant is in several small floors and not very large service was good especially by the italian staff the chinese waitress did not know anything about wines which was not unexpected but still not nice we shared few starters and had pizzas and grilled tuna as main course food was good and well prepared in our opinion prices were on high side for this type of restaurant but we will visit again because of good food and atmosphere, my wife and i visit palatino infrequently but enough that we are recognized palatino is what we consider an old reliable type of place to enjoy this type of italian food the food itself is made with high quality ingredients but served in a typical nononsense manner cozy and warm type of atmosphere palatino is not attempting any sort of trendy gimmicks either in food or decor and for that reason it feels like a getaway within shanghai the genuine care and concern of the staff also appeals to us we always feel good arrivinglooking forward to the experienceand leavingsatisfied in the value we receive a bottle of volpolecialla a pizza a pasta and salad is our standard fare and last night we finished with a wonderful panna cota that was wholly satisfying we have recommended this restaurant to others who have dietary concerns and feedback we received was that palatino happily accommodates such needs we will continue to enjoy and recommend palatino for a relaxing and reliable italian dining experience, my friend and i made a reservation for a friday night dinner we were met at the door by a man im assuming owns or manages the restaurant who showed us personally to our table which had been set up with everything including wine glasses of water the food did take quite a while to come out but once we started eating we didnt care my companion got the margherita pizza which was delicious with a wonderful thin and crispy crust while i got the truffle cream pasta nearly cried from how delicious it was definitely will be going back soon was a tad pricey at around, we recently moved to shanghai and palatino is already our favourite italian staff are really attentive and friendly and overall the food is genuine and fantastic starters of beef carpacio or tuna carpacio are exceptional we have tried most of their pizzas thin based as they do in rome and they are all absolutely delicious the one with iberico ham is one of our favourites pasta is done really well too and specially good is the linguine with sausage rosemary and truffle although i found the portion a bit small if you are not into pasta or pizza you are in luck too we tried grilled tuna recently and it was exceptional the freshest and juiciest we had in a while enjoy, the quality and the taste of the food was pretty good but a lil bit expensive though cosy small restaurant and the decor is okay the pizza was a bit overbaked and the pasta was heavy to eat, beautiful food relaxed atmosphere and great service
the pizza is one of the best i have had anywhere
the seafood is perfect
i go fairly infrequently as it is across town but the waiters always remember us and what we like to eat and drink, had the set lunch and it was fantastic the service is friendly and attentive the dining area is a bit small but the flavors are big it was very good, we had pizza and seafood dishes at a table of six restaurant could use air conditioning food was simply prepared wine selection was good service  perfect will be back next trip to shanghai, my husband and i cannot believe we have been living in shanghai for a number of years and only just now discovered this little gem it is hard to explain but you just know the food has been made with loving care thank you palatino for a really lovely evening with superb food in shanghai, i recently visited this restaurant for a business dinner meeting and was impressed by the quality of food and the service the restaurant is nicely designed and laid out and it is a little gem in shanghai if you are craving good tasty italian food then i would recommend it highly and i will for sure return next time i am in shanghai try the tuna in the main course, many of the restaurants i visit while traveling on business are ones i pick based on reviews and ratings on trip advisor on short notice i was looking for a new experience and wound up picking palatinos

the food was excellent and the restaurant has an interesting ambiance spread over 3 floors when you walk in the door the restaurant is very narrow and the first floor has a casual pizza place feel

we were seated on the 2nd floor and had a great dining experience the food and drinks were excellent this is definitely on my list of places to come again and may wind up being one of my go to places when im in shanghai, palatino has always been lauded by the expatriate community and finding italians hanging out in the restaurant doesnt harm its image

the lunch set menu was of great taste particularly the hearty vegetable soup pizza calebrese as expected by all former reviews was flavorful and its ingredients all complimented well i would pass on the dry chocolate cake with pine nuts as the desert consider a nice cup of nespresso coffee instead

service well above average

we are certainly coming back for dinner and the a la carte menu, stopped here for a delicious pizza for a late afternoon lunch it was worth the slight side trip very enjoyable a bit on the higher end of the price range but the ingredients were worth it, fantastic surprise best scampi i had in china better than all 5 stars hotels restaurants i had tried in last 20yrs in shanghai the aop pasta can be better though, went here for dinner on our recent visit to shanghai since hubby had never been enjoyed what i had so did hubby the desserts were very good so was the quality of the cold meats  the cheeseboard although overall a bit pricey i think thats what you get to pay in shanghai would def go again  yet to try pastas though recommend the palatino pizza i think its the best in the house, i visited palatino for lunch and the rmb98 set menu seemed to be too good value to ignore
i chose a pizza to go with the set starter sampler and i wasnt disappointed with any of the food the price may be reduced but the quality and surprisingly quantity werent i arrived hungry and left satisfied, brilliant food with great staff owners are attentive and interested best pasta dish i have ever had my partner had a pizza which was equally as good nice selection and recommendation on the wine as well, a 3 day quest to find this gem  we loved it quite possibly the best italian roman food we have had this side of the sun

and yes its on changle road  close to the crossing of moaming road its well worth the visit the pasta and pizza is incredible the tiramisu exceptional the wine list extensive and we had a fantastic bottle of pinot grigio

thank you ivan for the warm reception and explanation of the menu great to chat and discuss how a great place like this is so far from italy

the complimentary limoncello was awesome and sent us on our way very happy, i was in shanghai for one and a half weeks i can tell you that after 5 days of local food i was already fed up at night i decided to look for alternatives to try to balance my diet i came across this very cosy place where the staff speaks english spanish and italian apart from local language of course it can be found just behind the okura garden hotel a very central location in the french quarter
the food was excellent from the starters to the dessert i say that because im quite used to italian cuisine and the products are of very good quality and very fresh the kitchen is open for you to see what is going on and that gives you the opportunity to identify the goods they are using i always fancy the tomato soup everywhere i go and this one was top notch dessert wise the tiramisu is always a good choice and at this restaurant it is very good apart from that you have a very nice variety of pizza and pasta which will keep you busy when you need to choose
cannot say anything about wine as i do not drink wine
price wise it seems a very good option if you are looking for a normal price and good quality
will definitely go back on my next trip to shanghai, just a few steps from my wonderful airbnb apartment in the french concession was this welcome alternative to asian fare great appetizers and pizza wonderful ambiance for couples pricey wine list but the house selection was great and full bodied
the evening we were there a large party of french nationals were celebrating

47,"excellent food with a kitchen which is complete openso you can follow the process of cooking this is a place where you have a guaranty of quality food i will come back here, we had lunch at the other shagrila hotel in pudong called jui hua yuen but this place the food was so myuch better service was very good cant say any thing more you have to be there to experience everything, summer palace in jing an shangrila hotel is the restaurant which we found to celebrate my mother�s birthday this year since it has a quite grand and elegant environment very traditional and delicate cantonese cuisine

�grilled fried stuffed crab and scallop� this course is the specialty one on the menu with fresh ingredient and attractive appearance it�s also the 1st dishes which be ate up

�beijing roasted duck� waitress asked us which thickness we prefer when she cut the skin into slice very careful and thoughtful the taste of the sauce is a little bit sweet more like cantonese style

�chilled mango sago cream with pomelo� signature dessert my sister tasted 2 bowls most delicious

�peachshaped steamed bun� when i made the reservation with restaurant manager mr cai he recommended the �peachshaped steamed bun� to me as a birthday gift to my mother when he asked if need to prepare the birthday cake and got my answer which was no need
i could not imagine what kind of dim sum it will be when i heard it however it became the most popular one in the night by my parents and guests very traditional chinese classic dim sum with exquisite look and flavor it was beyond my expectation and well met the interests of old man appreciated the recommendation from him

overall summer palace has a good location and the night view during the christmas season was marvelous the environment for this restaurant was wonderful service for us was also a good experience my guests comment that they are also enjoy the dinner and would like to back for the birthday next year again in my opinion the return guest is the highest compliment for a restaurant right

especially thanks for the restaurant manager mr cai and may it�s a memorable night for my family, such a well decorated restaurant and may be one already expecting it from a shangri la hotel foods were finely prepared though price may be a little steep but to me it is worth it dont come here with expectation of having conventional foods in shanghai as they are different we enjoyed good dishes with wine and a wonderful evening, we discovered this place just by luck because we had a meeting at the shangrila it turns out that some of the plates we tasted were truly delicious

it seems that this place is definitely popular among locals and they are not a lot of foreigners you can still manage to place your order in english even if you wont be completely sure of what you are ordering, service is very good 
the quality of food is excellent 
the seats are comfortable 
the environment is nice too 
good value for the price 
the choice of vegetable is a bit limited , went with a group of 6 and we ordered all different dishes they were all amazing well prepare great flavors and a varies menu definitely try the duck the tofu cantonese was so flavorful the pork dishes were awesome dont think you can have bad meal here, enjoyed a meal here found the service to be very good no communication problems food was excellent more expensive than expected but couldnt fault anything, the chinese traditional snacks were served cold the staffs there dont speak english and no one is helpful to the guest who complained the quality of the food
i dont recommend dinner here the price is first class but the food and service under economic class, we were a group of 6 tables visiting this place for dinner food was ok but service needs improvement they never filled up the wine every time we need refill we cant find anyone even when they pass by and saw wine glass was empty they did nothing we visited summer palace in hong kong and guangzhou in shangrila their food quality and service are much much better, we were ordering the dim sum in shangrila summer palace which one of our local friends highly recommanded but when our local friend pointed out that there is a simple mistake on the dim sum menu to one of the summer palace staff in english is beef ball noodles soup but in chinese is  fish ball noodles soup she quickly told us yes its a mistake but its not their fault and giving us a lecture on their menu engineering challenges we feel we just only trying to inform them but its turn out we were told off for telling them the menu mistake wow shangrila really needs to change their attitude but the food is ok, our table has a fantastic view and the staffs are very kind and helpful at recommending the courses excellent view excellent service and excellent food, very good restaurant esp with very nice service from manager billy ma we always pick up summer palace as our company guests restaurant, good good good i stayed countless times at the hotel but always going out with customers or friends for dinners a colleague had once lunch at summer place and he told me it has been fantastic last night i gave a try to it simply amazing wasabi king prawns soup and vegetables easy and extremely well cooked will be back, they have divide the restaurant into two sections the self cater and the service area always go to the service one a relaxing atmosphere with tons of daylight good variety of dimsum chinese version of tapas love the panfried rice rolls with xo sauce not on the menu at self cater area
give it a try if youd like to spend an afternoon with good chinese food, very happy with having our wedding dinner here great atmosphere and service the food was excellent and the staff so helpful and kind especially thanks to robbins who made our evening a memorable one, the atmosphere is perfect the food is authentic and delicious service is quite up to speed and meet the top standard all the waiterswaitresses are friendly especially anita who speaks fluent cantonese and introduced all the best food to us

would definitely come again in next stay, one of best lounge in town in terms of quality of beverage however snack for happy hour needs improvement the service at lounge is excellent staff there is very attending speed of service is great

on the contrary the service at chinese restaurant is disappointing and is getting worse every time i dined there their excuse is they have many trainees working there strange execuse do they want to offer discount in price for discounted service anita was one of the staff show listened and took action

it is confusing now about benefit of diamond members it seems that no one can clearly explain clearly the only comment from staff is that the benefit is getting reduced  but without specific explanation room upgrade for diamond member  no more, every time i come to shanghai i will come to this summer palace restaurant  the manage anita mao is so nice and friendly  the service is very good here  and the most important thing is this summer palace restaurant is the best chinese restaurant i had ever eat the environment is very new and beautiful  the food is so yummy , one of the best restaurant in town the dim sum are worth every penny you spend here although it is not cheap great location, the dishes taste wonderfuland the girl serve us who called maggie was really really nice the last desert was my favorite i will come again~, nice place and good servicedelicious meal will invite more friends and family members coming again thank you very much, i like the pl service is excellent staff is so friendly and know their dishes well food is nice and warm when being served recommend all friends to come here and enjoy the wonderful service, had simple dinner today with two dishes  noodle and vegetable long waiting to start with the sequence was wrong

the noodle was worst in quality i ever had here  it was not even right temperature

the waiter was a trainee  first day for work the supervisor came to help eventfully upon my request

disappointing experience

hope it can be improved, this hotel restaurant was very good and service what i think is a typical chinese meal there are probably some more local restaurants that are better, we have a lunch gathering in this restaurant the cantonese dim sum is very delicious also the environment is good with excellent services, we enjoyed a delicious business lunch in summer palace like always the service was perfect friendly proactive and very flexible we also would like to thank berry who treated us so well
we will come back, my family and friends often dine in here due to the good service and delicious food offered in summer palace very professional service and the staff even make efforts to remember your name authentic cantonese cuisine with delicious food dim sum is highly recommended can be very busy most time and advance reservations will be good, good service excellent food thx kim for her taking care of my grandma and providing necessary dining tools every time she comes to the restaurant i would suggest their peking duck really delicious, excellent food and wine good service had several lunch and dinners there

for whatever reason the service seems to be slow for lunch but it is always busy for lunch reservation is recommended

dinners are always good perhaps due to low flow of customers

highly recommended, i came here with a colleague to debrief on a meeting over lunch the service was excellent and he ordered a selection of traditional shanghai dishes each dish was delicious and comparable to the best chinese meals i have had back in california i felt the setting was more formal and probably not a great spot to bring children however a great location if you would like to enjoy conversation or conduct business, we stayed at the hotel shangrila and had breakfast here both mornings the buffet spread was quite large and tasty it includes western as well as chinese items service was very good also, a suitable option for family reunion the cuisine there is delicate and delicious while the price per person is acceptable as well dishes are served quickly and the service is generally genuine especially from kim li bonus for the fine environment, hope this entry refers to the summer palace restaurant at the jing an shangri la because thats the focus of this review its a pity shangri la hotels choose such generic brand names for their star fb outlets sp in the jing an shang is very different from its sister restaurant in hong kong but they are equally good jing an is huge and seems to curl round the entire 3rd floor of the hotel but its separated into intimate clusters and private rooms and with its soft brown decor is always calm quiet and unhurried classic cantonese favourites are complemented by regional specialties and theres a great selection of the reviewers favourite shanghainese cold appetisers beautifully executed which keep him coming back the range of beers and the wine list as well as the speed of service could be improved  our superb kailan with preserved vegetables came after the dessert but we managed to do it justice overall a great restaurant and for the total experience fairly priced, an excellent authentic chinese eatery at shangrila jing an excellent service and a good choice not much for veggies but the restaurant hosts took all efforts to get us a very nice vegetarian fare, very good impression of this restaurant when we had our business activity in end of maygood team with delicious food and professional servicesespecially thanks for bill who given us strong supportalways do his best and sayok� to us i can unreservedly recommend this restaurant, love the delicious taiwan food you dont need to travel to taiwan from 616 mayjust come to summer palace of jin an shangrila in shanghai your choice of sliced mullet roe with turnip taiwan style doubleboiled mixed seafood soup basil leave braised with free range chicken beef noodle soup wok fried baby oyster with scallion are very tasty taiwan local cuisine the invited chef is from taiwan to present the taiwan food festival in the hotel i highly recommend the beef noodle soup and the mixed seafood soup great is the only word to describe yummy, while good the food is just average for a fine dining restaurant and i feel it is below the level of summer palace outlets at several other shangrila hotels around the world and definitely less succulent and refined than the seventh son formerly fook lam moon at some shangrila hotels service still has to find its tempo our waiter pours a new wine into the same glass where theres still another wine left not too expensive si you wont feel cheated, i was part of a small group who were treated to a dinner there one evening we just picked a few shanghai and ningbo dishes casually and i still remember eel is one of them the time it took for the dishes to be ready on our table was reasonable and most imporatnt all of us were equally impressed with the tastes and quality of the food served the whole eatery is spacious and the decor is luxurious and grand the mens room was as impressive as the dining area and you will see sculptures waterfalllike design and very very large mirrors inside this was not a lowcost dinner but the top quality service and everything else made me convinced that it was value for money indeed this is the kind of place where you should remain seated to really try and enjoy your tea food service and talks with your company in the atmosphere not in a rush, this is a place where you can enjoy excellent chinese food in a modern style service is accurate and the atmosphere fantastic wine list is good too nice place to go if you want elegant place with great chinese food, perfect dim sum which is value for money and simply delicious best book as the restaurant is a hit with the local community , a newly opened restaurent the service might still need some finetuning but they are trying impressive it was that when we afsked for a tasting menu they asked for a price range per person and 10 min later we had a printed version of a menu that gave us a little of everything

we had a number of starters dumblings soup peking duck fish and fresh fruit for 600 per person which was a good pricevalue food nice without being exceptional  and the same about the service good intentions but not there yet

the restaurant is a bit formal for my taste and it did not help the atmospher that there were very fee people","Italian cuisine",0.999334275242096
48,"very nice place for dinner with terras and view on the financial district service is good and food awesome, xibo specializes in the food of chinas northwest region of xinjiang where tribes still roam on horseback and eat hearty meals the uighur are also from the region influenced by muslim influence from turkey and iran the cuisine here tends to be heavily lamb based with dollops of mashed eggplants and roasted peppers for good measure you will not be disappointed with xibo everything looks good but definitely try their roast lamb sliced into pieces their tacolike fillings and all the kebabs you can eat a delectable surprise awaits you, if you like xinjiang food xibo is a great option and some of the staff speak english which makes it very easy and foreigner friendly food is great highly recommend it walking distance from the shanghai hilton, ate hear on our last night in shanghai great food and service
who new muslims make a beer tasted great
lamb dishes where perfect highly recommend, i go here every time im in shanghai convenient from hilton great spicy food atmosphere and service is ok not perfect but you are in shanghai love the food good wine selection and cocktails prices are reasonable
, atmosphere is not bad and prices are just a little high unfortunately the food is just too plain shanghai has more authentic northwestern chinese restaurants that are not half as pretentious where the lamb skewers really taste like lamb i could not tell the difference between their beef and lamb their chicken just tasted like tofu

and dont even mention the yogurt, we went to this place as a team lunch as it was suggested by our chinese colleagues it was definitely a good choice they have good good variety of food including some vegetarian options the cuisine is basically from northwest china  its a good place for casual dining nice ambiance  helpful staff, i personally thought the taste was not strong enough comparing to other xinjiang restaurant in other countries for the review i thought it will be mindblowing

it was such a letdown when i tasted most of the dishes dont get me wrong they are not disgusting or anything but in my honest opinion they were just average the skewers lamb chop pumpkin dumpling potato chicken soup with hand noodle the hand noodle was good and vegetable

overall it was a good meal but just didnt think it was as good as people review it as, the location is not far from jingan temple the enviroment is good and the taste is good as well i have had dinner and lunch there for 4 times really enjoy the services and the dishes, amazing food especially their numerous lamb dishes polite service adequate prices and overall great experience, ive been to xibo many times and was never disappointed the menu variety is very good kebabs yummy flat bread fresh overall choice of dishes is very good wish the dessert menu was less westernised and more authentic  i would love to eat something more exotic than another version of an average western dessert, back again for some fantastic lamb and chicken dishes the standard and quality of the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable our pary of four were very happy with our dinner good winelist which is not always the case in shanghai and the drinks are good too, very nice location on walking distance from the big hilton hotel i was invited from 2 collegues to have dinner here after i just arrived big suprise and enjoyed the excellent food very quick ordening and delivery  i can recommend the potatoe soup and the lamb also very nice green vegetables, awesome bbq meat but not only you can close your eyes and order what you want without being disappointed and yes it is a bit pricy but at least you know what you are eating, went to xibo twice during my visit to shanghai once with customers and once by myself we very much enjoyed sitting outside on the terrace good spicy food and interesting wine list with good selections for shanghai will be back, central location warm atmosphere and friendly service make up for the fact that this may not be the best uighur meal you can have but its still pretty good the best dishes come in large portions roast leg of lamb big plate chicken so it would be better to come here in a large group xinjiang food is very rich in flavours one of the more enjoyable halal cuisines in the world, i recommended xibo for a group dinner with my classmates in shanghai and it did not disappoint several people said this was the highlight of their dining experience in china and i have to agree with them great food at reasonable prices in an awesome setting

understand up front that this is not traditional chinese cuisine and youre eating food from northwest china but the menu has a huge offering that runs the gambit from tapas style dishes to group platters and from heavy meats to vegetarian options i tried a stew of some sort with potatoes lamb chilis noodles and cabbage which was served in a heated pot and quite delicious i also ordered the naan style bread which wasnt bad though the highlight here was the dipping sauce i tried some candied sweet potatoes good and some of the grilled lamb which was excellent the drinks were popular and i ordered two black beers which were different and tasty

the staff was helpful and moved our group which grew after we arrived from inside to the rooftop which was constantly being misted to make the august heat more bearable the heat wasnt an issue during our meal the inside and outside are both stylish and laid back and the deck offers some nice views of shanghai you can see the pudong skyline from afar if you stand up but not while youre sitting down the setting really reminded me of being in new york city in a very good way

overall this was a really fun nice place to eat a different type of food in shanghai if anthony bourdain ever does another show here this is something hell have to feature a great experience id recommend to anyone, had such yummy food here  the lamb chops are honestly some of the best lamb chops ive ever had really really great food good service and very reasonably priced would recommend, really a nice place to enjoy different chinese food uygur region if im not mistaken
the skewers on the charcoal are fantastic as well as many other dishes
the staff is really friendly and helpful
a small terrace to enjoy outdoor dinner at this time of the year better do reservation for it before, im from southwest china and love the food from there but most of the restaurants serving xinjiang or xibei food are a bit shabby xibo combines authentic tasting food with great decor comfortable environment where you can order western wine with your food and pleasant presentation of the food its not one of those touristtraps its simply xibei food in a more pleasant environment ive taken my parents there and have been there on business parties and birthday parties westerners and chinese alike all love the food so highly recommended for anyone coming to shanghai ps the food is not super spicy but you need to tolerate a little spices, we were four and asked our hotel to make a reservation for us i believe that otherwise we would have still had a table but not the table that we had it was a very interesting view overlooking the interior of a residential area the restaurant atmosphere was ideal with the view and a style that was contemporary and casual the service was excellent because the menus are books and we always ordered up to ten items we started the practice of taking photos of the dishes we wanted and it made it easier to remember or sometimes simply show the server the photos it also helped us remember what we ordered days later days later we were still talking about our meal here because it was amazing we ate at many fantastic restaurants in shanghai and this was hands down our favorite we thank ta for highlighting it in their short list itinerary we ordered marinated cucumber salad with chili dressing roasted duck breast with pear chickpea salad with carrot potato and mint charcoal grill meat skewers fries uyghur bread with lamb onion cumin and chili dry hot pot style lamb with coriander and wok fried green beans with chili all were unique flavorful and memorable the drinks were also great and the drink menu was varied this will forever rank as one of my favorite meals, this is the best halal restaurant in shanghai even if you are not looking for a halal experience then go there for the culinary experience because the food is delicious they also have the absolute best lamb chops i have ever tasted  i had to order in more the restaurant is very stylish the staff serviceminded and nice
i can highly recommend this place , spring time is outdoor table seating as usual the service is great our 16 months daughter get her baby chair and a regular chair for playing staff is nice helpful smiling and making a great atmosphere food is xinjiang a lot of lamb but also meat vegetables and potatoes our favorites are always a winner when bringing friends and family spicy beans is a must and the sweet potato is a great finish but you need lamb the shops are a must have dish what more other guests are also friendly enjoy a great evening out prebook to get your best desired table sorry for not having more than one picture should have been ten+, usually fully booked  for a reason nice atmosphere and above all really good food and affordable prices as well will definitely come back, stumbled across this place on tripadvisor we chanced it as the reviews were really good it was perfect for me as i dont eat pork the food is halal perfect for muslims and there is no pork so i could eat everything on the menu we got a bit carried away with our ordering as we were famished but everything was excellent we ordered the beef  potato curry egg  peppercorn dumplings pumpkin  beef dumplings the mixed skewers  a yummy broccoli  mushroom stir fry flavours are delicate and well balanced  absolutely delicious i also had the chocolate fondant dessert which was yummy but would have been good to have more local chinese desserts on the menu good relaxed and casual atmosphere  perfect for small and large groups alike it was superb and id recommend xibo to anyone and also very reasonably priced which is always a bonus, xibo is upstairs in a main drag off the side of the former french concession buzzing with locals tourists and expats the proprietorscooks must be doing a lot right for it to be so busy and well patronised we pointedat the picture menu and were happily surprised to find our choices were all very palatable to western diners like us without any surprises so for example the huge bowl of beef and potatoe stew for four people was just what it looked like  a delicious peppery beef stew the vegetable dishes were crisp a cooked to perfectionnothing stodgy or over cooked here thanks for a great meal, meet sticks a bit dry same for lamp low temperature cooked but rest ok and honest price and good service can get better in shanghai for same price but with less centered locatio, coming from a city where we are blessed with very good chinese restaurants xinjiang cuisine is virtually nonexistent there hence we just had to seek one out in shanghai

xibo appears to be a popular place judging from the midweek crowd it is pleasantly laid out so you wont feel as if you are sitting elbowtoelbow to the tables next to you

lamb chops came in a generous proportion for two of us would have loved to order the signature chicken and potatos dish but stealing a glance to the next table we regretfully decided that theres no way we could do it justice it looked like a dish we could eat over the course of a couple of days  the black fungus which we ordered was good lightly seasoned

a nice experience altogether, this restaurant offers many excellent meat and vegetable recipes from the western province of xinjiang we had a group of 10 or so and the great service matched the many dishes that were all full of the distinct flavors of xinjiang i�ve visited twice over a period of several years and have not yet been disappointed we were told that much of the meats and other ingredients are brought in from farms in xinjiang which contributes to the authentic cuisine make sure you leave room for one of their awesome desserts, no pork grilled meat lots of veggies and plenty of spices and peppers this was my fourth or fifth time at xibo spread out over a few years this was the first time i went alone everything was good as always but a lot of the menus options are really best for at least two people green beans with chilis  two or three people lamb chops  6 chops a bit much for one person pumpkin soup  a one person dish spinach a one person dish when travel brings me to shanghai ill continue going to xibo next time with at least one more person, this very low key xinjian food restaurant was recommended to us from our hotel it didnt disappoint we loved the mellowness of the restaurant and the food was served with pride, nice location in the older french concession nice decoration and great xinjian food specially uyghur one, amazing food and price efficient as well be sure not to miss the lamb racks ribs with the classical chinese seasoning we ordered abou 8 dishes for 5 people which was fairly good also try the dark beer goes well with the spicy food enjoy, we left some food and we asked them to pack it up for us they asked us for coin as they said this service wasnt free of course the bill was above 200rmb i guess the coin was compensating the cost of the tupperware awful attitude from the management of a nice restaurant also the music reminder me of a night club in liverpool i was listening to tiesto and others there is something wrong about this place food was ok, one of the best places in shanghai for xinjiang food with an amazing menu great ingredients and ambience and located slightly off jingan it is a must place to eat when you are in shanghai, i strongly recommend this place their grilled lamb dishes are really delicious and comes in many variations and shapes perfect for family and friends
i strongly recommend this place, the food is good quality ingredients very flavorful theyve got an english menu with big pictures super nice staff saw a lot of local families here make a reservation to be safe i dont know if its truly excellent but thats what im rating it  its easy tasty and different  a hard combo to beat on a vacation only watchout is the portions can be huge and you might feel guilty leaving some food behind, xibo is now a must when in shanghai i really like the spicy food especially chicken and lamb and the wine is ok which is not always the case here, sometimes in shanghai its hard to find food that is really different xibos menu is a mix of north chinese with russian influences

we went here for my birthday the staff were friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was great

try the cashew nuts with coconut breads and the grilled meats

they also have a great wine menu and cocktails to choose from i would really recommend this place its in what looks like an office building but dont be alarmed its really worth a visit, when we entered this restaurant we didnt realize that they were close to closing for the lunchday meal however they seated us and proceeded to bring us some wonderful dishes we tried the cucumber salad the lamb ribs the yogurt the different kinds of breads would definitely return for another helping of this delicious uighur cuisine, been here three times now but each time ive left feeling the same  that the food was average so im not sure what all the hype is

we ordered lamb chop which the meat itself was very tasty however there was so much fat on the meat it was hard to eat we also had the deboned chicken and potato dish but a few pieces came with bone

we asked for yoghurt when we ordered but had to ask for it three more times before we got it by then we had finished most of the meal and was onto the last two so yoghurt was not really needed

apart from the yoghurt blib overall the service is good they have been extremely busy each time ive gone so they must be doing something right, the dinner was great but the dessert was amazing their pastry chef is exceptional i really enjoyed my evening and found the food delish and a great value massive dinner with drinks and dessert for under us$100 for two, amazing food fresh and hearty from the xinjiang province hard to describe but it included large platters of meat and potato chipati type bread meat on skewers and yummy vegetable dishes recommended by locals and definitely worth a visit for an evening meal, i have been here twice and its just amazing food from muslim xinjiang province is chinese with heavy middle easternturkish influence lamb chops to die for the big plate chicken too tasty for words busy on weekends so book in advance, xibo is a great restaurant for those travelers who want some authentic northwestern chinese food  the lamb chops are outstanding and grilled vegetables are delicious hard to go wrong here the restaurant is not the easiest to find  on the fourth floor of a commercial building  but definitely worth the trip, a colleague based in shanghai took me to xibo beforehand he spoke highly about it from the minute the lift door opened i could see smell and hear why he is so impressed with xibo however once we got our food i realised the understated english manner of my colleague did the place no justice sorry daniel it is more than exceptional in every way

the service and customer ethic was top class we arrived 5 minutes before our booking  they were so apologetic that we could not be seated immediately to compensate we were given a complementary drink

the style of food truly appealed to me just that bit more adventurous than the normal chinese fare loved the muslim middle eastern influence

a must when in shanghai, we go here regulary as we love the food the staff speaks english very well and the food is tailored to foreigner so you will not find chicken feet or head in your food we try a different dish every time but we like them all the only one we always order is the sweet potato with caramel it is best to take this one the last very sticky very strange but so good, ive been to xibo twice so far and always loved the food it presents food from northwest china with a strong influence from central asia so theres a lot of lamb on the menu

the top dish for me is the grilled lamp chops which come with a dry rub and sweet sauce for dipping the lamb is succulent and both the dry rub and sweet sauce really elevate the taste also good is the lamb tossed with bread and cumin  it is addictive

i would definitely recommend a meal at xibo  really great food and different to what you would normally eat in shanghai, i lived in shanghai for 3 years and didnt know about this place until august last year i had a dinner there we were 10 girlfriends the service was fast and professional the food was really delicious the options are great even if you are vegetarian i let my chinese friends order and we shared like all chinese would do so i recommend doing so as well and try a bit of everything the food seemed to be very authentic it was a delicious evening, if shanghai isnt exotic enough then eat at xibo and experience a far western region of chinese cuisine known for muslim dishes centered on lamb cumin and fantastic flatbreads everything is delicious and plates are meant for sharing","dumpling restaurant",0.987040726373701
49,"great place to go to have a american style burger friendly service nice presentation not quite like a grilled burger in the midwest but good for the locale, ordered mixed grill and their burger set with mushroom sauce like the mixed grill as the pork and lamb are succulent and nicely done would have preferred the burger to be juicer, i dont live in shanghai but have been there numerous times over a total of about eight months always get a craving for a good hamburger after a few weeks one of my weaknesses found good burgers elsewhere but this is the best truly a thick juicy burger made to order with excellent fries as well big drinks menu and other choices besides burgers on the main menu it is in the basement level shopping area of the swfc the second tallest building in shanghai with the bottle opener top so its easy to find if you are in the heart of the city and wish to satisfy your burger fix also try monday nights when its buy one burger get one free, the menu consists american fast food and also some asian meals the cok tails and drinks prices are ok they use tap water for the tea which makes the taste horrible too many fried food in the menu therefore i feel they should check their fry oil often it is so so heavy the quality of the meat that they use for their burgers is just ok not bad but dry , good variety of international food with some typical asian dishes  good quality and good beer  to try if you do not want to eat only asian food , ive had a couple of meals at blue frog kerry parkside pudong shanghai over the past year and it has been their burger that has been most consistent and my favourite at this restaurant

had the montana burger for a late lunch  the beef patty was medium or 70 juicy wellseasoned and cooked nicely lightly charred on the outside between the toasted bun 2 large onion rings not the starch filled type rather large real onions thick tomato a couple of pickles or gerkins depending on which part of the world you hail from a lettuce leaf and crispy bacon the burger comes with a side salad nothing to shout about and a bunch of fries or chips priced at rmb98 or about usd14 or sgd20

i had a small blue frog ceasars salad as a starter  not bad but not great nice chunks of chicken albeit a bit dry and croutons slightly underseasoned and with a light caesars dressing  rmb58 or usd850 or sgd12

sitting outside alfresco takes in the sun and cooler weather is great but not without its setbacks its a service blind spot after you have secured the service staffs attention and placed your order the food service was prompt and efficient

a decent lunch at rmb156 is not the cheapest but remember you are in shanghai you are in kerry parkside not quite the mainstream shanghai or china either

overall experience at blue frog has been good and yes it will be a place i will revisit when i am in the vicinity, for a change from eating local foods my wife and i craved a hamburger we found this restaurant across the street from our hotel the service was excellent as was the food the waitress told us it was happy hour and that you got two drinks for the price of one not only was the price of the drinks and the meal low but the quality of both was great highly recommend this location, we were visiting with our son and his fiance he decided to take us to an american style bar we went for happy hour the prices were good and the food was great the drinks were a bit weak for the price but all in all it was fun, my wife and i ate here during our stay in china last week and this place was awesome i had a burger and she had a chicken quesadilla and both items were great the food and the atmosphere made us both feel like we were home in the us i would definitely eat here again, i mainly go for dinner on mondays with my friends because they have a buy one get one free burger special the atmosphere is quite nice and its crowded with foreigners staff speak perfect english and they are very helpful in addition they have happy hour on their cocktails with a wide menu to choose from so far my favorite burger is the arugula and ham and i love their passion fruit mojito, i had a burger with double beef tomato bacon cheese  salad the staff was great always asking if everything was ok food arrive quick nice pub atmosphere  if you like meat burger  also some snack and beer this a great place, great beer to be in china mainly belgian beer but they had a few favorites from america as well as the ordinary local brews, the best time to visit this place is monday buy one get one free burger plus happy hours for beer they wont cook your burger bellow medium but big chance it would be med well or well done for sure beef patty is not grilled just cooked on flat top therefore is lacking flavor not easy to make some modifications on burger set and if they agree expect an extra charge
service is very relaxed and you never know who is going to come to your table if you need help most of clientele are local people with lower demands for western food quality and service it says a lot good deal on food and drinks but with a lot of negative points for sure it is my last time to visit them, the photo says it all
nice happy hour
the wagyu beef sliders are excellent
the seared ahi tuna salad is outstanding, never get a burger with a bacon wraped patty it was sooo dry and over cooked even the buns were dry
my friends burger was fine though and tasted great the chicken spring rolls i highly recommend plus go there during happy hour
shoutout to the girl who served us she was fantatstic the service besides her showed abit of laziness there should always be a person close to the door noticing new guests or even those who want to sit outside cos no servers were outside, dining alone i asked for a table for 1 they put me at the bar then came back 10 mins later to get my order i asked to be seated elsewhere the bar was so noisy and i didnt fancy eating dinner at the bar another 10 mins went by and no one came to find a new seat so i walked out absolutely awful avoid if busy, a collegue took me there and i enjoyed a great dinner gina made the final touch by doing just the extra mile to feel us at home and appreciate extra service great food great service buttt pls close the door to the outside  our food was blown nearly from our plates, a nice place to unwind good range of beers on tap and bottled atmosphere is lively without being loud families and workmates sit side by side pretty comfortably and the service is good, took a group of 20 teachers here during a training i was running set basic menu choice of noodles fajitas burgers or veggie burger appetisers and 2 dessert choices
food was tasty but the cocktails were tastier and buy one get one free
nice range of cocktails nice atmosphere and reasonable prices, after days of eating what i can only describe as dodgy shanghai food we found the blue frog it was fantastic to find food that tasted how it should i only had a burger but it was a very good burger if you visit shanghai my advise would be to search out good reviews on here because good places are really hard to find in shanghai unless you know where you are going, dropped by here for lunch and so much variety for weekend lunch took a while to decide among the salads burgers pastas and egg dishes finally settled for the sichuan burger it was good as a regular burger and the sichuan flavour was barely there good service part of a large chain in shanghaichina, had a casual dinner here with 4 colleagues and the relaxed atmosphere and good food made it a fun night we started with some cold beers which were great on a hot shanghai evening the guys went for burgers and the girls went for sliders and pasta which were generous in size and really tasty the service was very good and the staff were very relaxed about us bringing our own wine  they kept it chilled for us and did not charge us a corkage fee will go there again, my friend and i came here for dinner on a wednesday evening we chose the outdoor seat usually when seated outdoor staff tend to ignore you but the service here is excellent staff was very attentive to our needs a staff stayed outdside to ensure our needs are met right away

we had the sliders made up of 4 small burgers there is an option for combination so we chose to have 2 salmon and 2 chicken tandoori burgers the salmon burger was very good the platter was also good however plating wasnt appealing my friend had mojito and i had a mocktail both were very good and to our surprise the waitress offered each of us free drinks similar to what we ordered thumbs up

location on my first attempt i didnt find it because the address i had didnt indicate its inside swfc

will definitely be back, wow a lovely and pleasant place for a break on a hot day in shanghai we only had two shanghai beers but the service was superb, i liked the sichuan burger gets crowded at lunch good place to go when you want american bar  grill beer burger fries good, good atmosphere 4 people 64� correct food is good and also the service its inside the mall not in the street wifi available, so there i was in shanghai on a business trip and it was my turn to find dinner for this group including a couple of my bosses  tripadvisor showed us the blur frog and it was a hit  i have had some good burgers in my day but the brie and pear one was to die for , sometimes in china ll you need is western food if that is the case blue frog is a good place
burgers and salads are good the other offers are average

place is clean and the service is excellent, yassssman i like blue frog always great memories when im there dont miss their happy hour48pm buy one get one free but no thumbs down to the blue frog mojito im sorry but it tastes like mouthwash to meoverdid the mint but the classic mojito is a good decision oh yeah pus monday burgers>>love i dont remember the name of this one burger but it had a giant onion ring and to me that was spoton exactly what i needed on a monday i mean happy hour and a giant burger with a ginormous onionring did i mention for burger mondaysits burgers happy hour literally if youre wondering why i just talked about burgers onlywell i went on a monday and even when i went the second timeit was a monday too yayy memore power to burgers and onionrings and happy hours mondays will never be the same, outstanding burgers very cool environment nice to go there for a casual dinner with your friends or family i recommend it to everyone who wants to have a good meal, nice place good food the fajitas were my favourite but the prices are kind of outrageous for china, if this restaurant were in europe or america i wouldnt have given it more than 2 or 3 stars but being in shanghai and having eaten in other places there believe me i could even give it 5 stars tasty ok quality and no stomach upset afterwards im happy enough with that, this is a hopping place in the evening very busy but they are pretty good at working you in to a table or at the bar outdoor seating is a plus sitting at the bar can be very entertaining as you watch the bar staff work together as a team nonstop to fulfill the orders that flow in constantly, i came after my long day out

luckily it was a happy hour so that was the positive side

i ordered lam and made clear specification that lam should be medium rare

well of course it came well done this really starts to annoy restaurants even have the pictures in the menue and still they fail i have to say that over 50 of restaurants fail the first delivery and some even twice this is unbelievable

anyway food was good when they got it right nice and crusty sides

but maybe i dont need to come to this place again ok but something is missing

thank you blue frog, the food was average nothing to rave about but better than a lot of places in shanghai not too expensive and we enjoyed it staff were attentive and helpful would go here again, if you feel the need of eating something different than chinese food this place is great to go not overfancy reasonable priced quick serving and good food, if you are in shanghai and you want a great burger then look no further than the bluefrog i recommend the montana they have a good menu and a nice selection of traditional bar food the food is all well prepared and the staff is very attentive if you are traveling and want a little taste of home us give them a try if you are staying across the street at the hyatt it is perfect place for dinner, i had a rough start here went to sit at the bar and thought i was invisible finally figured out that you had to be seated at the bar and served by wait staff so i got a table in the bar instead located in a nice area with many interesting restaurants food was good not great service was ok not great in fact the staff seemed to be a little off the night i was there when i paid the rmb 123 bill with 200 the guy never came back with the change finally got that sorted out and a manager apologized for the inconvenience in my opinion there are better places, decent fresh burgers with some interesting twists the special offer on monday is extremely good value for decent western food in shanghai as are the happy hour drinks deals, it is fine place to dine for western visitors they have pseudo american menu with with chinese flavor, nice place to try some really good food the mega burgers look really spectacular similarly tasty are the various salads rich offer for juices and deserts try to sit outside to enjoy the view of swfc also happy hour in the evening for some drinks, when you dont want to eat chinese food again this is a great place for burgers fries and the like the caesar salad is great as well are the burgers try the people mountain people sea burger good eats will return, a group of us went to this place for a bite to eat and a drink what a great choice the food was great pub food excellent staff with good english and buy 1 drink get one free does it get any better really good atmosphere as well i would highly recommend you pop into this bar,  especially on monday when they have burger promotion nice in summer to sit outside and look up to the bottleopener really great place fantastic food and for shanghai cheap prices, we had just arrived in shanghai with a halfday to ourselves and found this gem on our way to crossing under the river

the staff were very courteous and the menu was englishfriendly

i had the burger and not knowing what to expect was pleasantly surprised it might not have been as great as what youd find in new zealand but it was an excellent substitute

the menu was quite varied and while the prices seemed a bit much at the time it wasnt until i ate at a few other restaurants that i realised the prices were not ridiculous

we ate during a weekend afternoon but i imagine the place would be quite fun and popular during the evenings, thank you i had a great steak here during my visit in beijing i was looking for a good steakhouse for a long time and happy that i found this place, this is a restaurant that i used to visit regularly in the past but recently they have quality problems in all their branch their menu is mostly about fries and the oil they are using is getting worse and worse each time and they are using tap water for their tea you could do better guys buy yi tong shui for less than 20 rmb which will give you plenty of tea service is always very good and attentive, touristy for sure but pretty much the only place we could find to get some drinks while seeing shanghai pop in for a drink the appetizers were pretty solid overall good place, one for my favourite dining place when im in the area been there for several times with group of friends they really served a proper aussie burger and nice vb beer be patience with your order though, i was there for my last night in sh i wanted some food and drink to relax myself i ordered a sichuan spicy burger with spicy sausage and coriander in it taste good and special while i ordered waiter told me that any drink is buyonegetonefree i ordered a cocktail and after i finished my first cup the waiter was acting promptly to get me another one very good service","Japanese cuisine",0.999830323456458
5,"4 friends all picked different starters and mains to share an incredible meal everything was excellent the atmosphere the service the food huge wine list couldnt find one single negative note worth the price definitely probably the best chinese meal ever, went here for a business dinner and the meal was absolutely fantastic however we had 8 pm reservations and had to stand at the bar for about an hour before they finally seated us the bartender was really nice though and made us some pretty spectacular drinks so the wait wasnt all that bad would have been nice if they had our table ready when we got there or at least close to ready but it didnt deter the deliciousness of the food and the quality of the meal would definitely recommend for an upscale dim sum meal to anyone living andor visiting shanghai, enjoying eating especially when the food is good should not be taken as a speeding process to take you out due to the next service is coming sorry will never go back as a restaurant is like a factory next next and next, we had dinner at hakkasan restaurant by the bund the view is spectacular from the window by our table we could see the tv tower all light up
the food was so delicious i just kept telling myself i love china i love china as i was eating, this restaurant is one of the fancy chinese fusion restaurants in shanghai with a fancy price tag the food is very good and the atmosphere is pleasant so the higher price is justified ask for a more private table if you need more privacy, i had the best dim sum lunch and cocktail everything was absolutely divine i especially liked the crispy shrimp and mushroom dim sum i had a yummy cocktail with dates  ginger beer as well the spot has a cool ambiance as well and a pretty view i could see it being fun at night as well, delicious chinese restaurant with great views 
we got a table with a big window facing the bund the fish was delicious they have lots of vegetarian friendly options which was good for us
tthe service was excellent, on a business trip i have the chance to have a meal at hakkasan the dim sum are one of the best i have ever full of flavour lot of texture and exquisite flavour  i cannot comment on quality price because i was invited, so far i can tell this place uses quite fine ingredients some popular so called high end places skimp on good raw materials it reminds me of the first time i had very proper imported smoked buffalo mozzarella not locally made attempts to duplicate it

here you get the same clear impression the duck tastes very nice not cheap and greasy

the caviar here is definitely the best i have tasted so called finest caviar from iran with some extremely rich people in shanghai but it was definitely not as good as the caviar at hakkasan

on top of this they prepare and present the dishes perfectly i appreciate a place that does not get lazy and start to slip so far it seems to be holding up

nice to see a place stay stable when its good, hakkasan has been my wishlist resto for quite long time and i am so glad to finally be able to dine in at hakkasan shanghai

tried their premium menu which was crispy duck with superior caviar jasmine tea smoked chicken friend duck with xo sauce and their friend rice foods were yummy beyond words price might be exxy but it was worth every pennies i ended spending rmb 1008 for dinner date with hubby and we were super satissfied, this restaurant is high end the food and cocktails are refined and unique the service was great we had this guy i believe he was from taiwan very happy to help us and suggest dishes every dishes is presented in a delicate way and very unique flavor the atmosphere is romantic not much light just perfect the restaurant is on the bund so if you book well in advance you can have a table near the window if you want to go for a date this can be definitely an option you will not regret enjoy, the duck with caviar has to be the best duck i have ever tasted nothing comes close the restaurant is designed beautifully plus the views of pudong are priceless, very stylish place  good old fashioned chinese look with shanghai twist  great mood lighting music and layout

food was delicious  not too fussy  loved the dim sum

swanky bar good mix of localinternational crowd

recommended, i wanted to make it to hakkasan during my visit to shanghai but didnt know which day i could go i walked in on a sunday evening hoping that i could get a seat without a booking

they greeted me with delight and said they would make something work for me  seating me at the bar for 15 minutes

at the bar i ordered myself a zong zi cha cocktail do it its delicious the fanfare associated with the delivery is awesome cocktails are actually fairly priced and delicious

i didnt want to have visited hakkasan and not had their famous dim sum so i asked my waitress to clarify if they used any pork or pork products during the preparation  upon some investigation they told me that even the vegetarian dim sum may contain pork fat i had to unfortunately skip these but opted for the crispy duck rolls  delicious i appreciated the effort they went to find out for me

for my main i ordered the crispy skin chicken and as a desert the chocolate sphere

i wasnt really dressed for the hakkasan dining experience having ventured around shanghai all day id say my attire was more essential tourist albeit all black than my businessgoing out look its definitely a dress up sort of place whoops

expect to walk away for 750900 per person with a glass of wine

when making a booking request a window seat you wont be disappointed, have been three times in past 6 months nice setting with views of pudong if you sit near the windows food is good with heavy focus on dimsum items  good for sharing or family style wine list is very extensive and pricing about average for high end restaurant in shanghai food pricing is high but thats to be expected if you want to eat on the bund, i loved this place it can properly be described as spectacular the view and space begin the spectacle beautiful and a bit otherworldly the welcome and the service were excellent  they want you to love the place  no earnest foodie lectures here they just want to look after you and the food was just delicious  the dumplings i had to start were like nothing i have had before or since too good to remember properly i look forward to going back it was all great go, hakkasan has been very famous in other country like dubai and la for me is one of the best chinese fine dining restaurant is a pitty that they are not in the michelin star guide shanghai but the food and the cocktail are really good picking with caviar is the best overall is a bit pricy but is worth of visit, we arrived a little late for our reservation but they had saved the table which was nice on receiving the menu we werent initially given the early bird set despite being within the time frame so we had to ask for it maybe this is the norm

staff were very helpful and we enjoyed a lovely set meal for a very reasonable price the duck salad in particular was a great dish

as youre saving on the food be sure to splurge on the cocktails they have an excellent selection to choose from, i took my then girlfriend now wife to this restaurant for our anniversary i absolutely loved it because the atmosphere felt very good  service was also very good food was delicious though maybe the servings were a tad small it is right in front of the bund and has a spectacular view and i felt the prices were reasonable considering its location if you like southern chinese style food then this is the place to come to i ate during lunch and the pollution level was low that day so it was absolutely a great experience for my wife and i i would go back again, not as easy to find the first time but when found absolutely worth the effort the reception was nice and once seated the service was close to impeccable some small confusion with regards to food ordered but the quality of the food was worth the wait the portions are very suitable and the taste buds were more then happy with the served meals the live music with a sax player was nicely tuned to the conversation level within the restaurant no wonder this is one of the 50 best restaurants in asia, i knew hakkasan already from new york and came with really high expectations and yes hakkasan sh even exceeded <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a> in all aspects 100, this place has a nice view from the bar in the restaurant you can enjoy a nice and cosy atmosphere and tasteful dishes its a chinese reinvented cuisine if you dont know or think you might dont like or youre a fan of chinese food this is the place for you every single bite if just perfect and makes you discover new tastes quite expensive tho but definitely a perfect place for a special occasion, my husband and i went here for supper they have a tasting menu available from 530 till 630  we skipped lunch having had a quick look online at a sample menu i was a bit disappointed that the actual menu wasnt the same however i neednt have been we started with a cocktail each and had a glass of moroccan rose with our food we had dim sum platter and crispy duck salad the presentation was beautiful and the food was so tasty our main courses were prawns on a mild curry sauce and the most delicious beef with jasmine rice and pak choi pudding wasnt like anything ive ever had in chinese restaurant before a sort of deconstructed lemon meringue pie which just doesnt convey how delicious it was and an amazing flaming tart tartin the service was perfect and the staff we really pleased that we had come to shanghai as part of our holiday and were surprised that we were able to come on a 144 hour visa waiver basis the bill came to about <u+00a3>100 which considering the setting the food and service was more than worth it cant wait to try another hakkasan, well after having read all opinions and maybe making to much hope of it was a disappointment

first there was a lot of tables in the restaurant and most of them without any view hence also a lot of noise

service is fine but nothing more

we arrived early so we had a drink at the bar which is very nice and drinks are good
then we had a rather good wine and quiet good dumplings and tiger shrimps but nothing amazing there the fish seabass was excellent and chicken just fine last chocolate dessert was good

last went we finished our dinner we asked for a taxi the restaurant told us to see with the caretaker service down which told us to find one at the front of the street where taxis didnt take us because we were to close

so because of the food we rate 3 but the price for all of this is insane
we had the chance to do severals michelin stars 1 2 and 3 in france and in other countries
sorry but hakkasan is far from being one just the prices are right there for a one star

worst we went to a restaurant ranked in the 50s of ta and well we found it better than hakkasan for the same sort of restaurant

we wont eat there again, excellent food nice atmosphere and nice people great service all is delicious price ok for the quality of food and location, good evening miss anne what a greeting stepping inside this fabulous restaurant the service and the staff at this restaurant is in a different class altogether although high and fancy very personal  never experienced this anywhere in the world  outstanding food is almost as good wine music an exceptional experience go, great food great service martin was amazing
this place really looks after the details and the staff shows it has good training
the food was very tasty very high class
a must visit if in shanghai
the space is very modern and inviting
you will not be disappointed
super recommended, this was our 2nd time at hakkasan and it is still my favourite fine dining restaurant on the bund we went early to enjoy cocktails at the bar before dinner which i would recommend the staff were fantastic and we felt like the whole experience was classy and atmospheric the food was delicious as were the wine and cocktails we really just enjoyed everything expect modern music dim lighting etc but it all works very well together i would highly recommend for a special night out the satay chicken and shanghai dumplings were delicious we were two women and ordered two small eats and one main dish with rice this was plenty, we had a great night out in this fancy place though we somewhat missed the traditional cuisine the wine card is outstanding, i think hakkasan shanghai deserves at least 1 michelin star i came here with my wife and daughter during our anniversary and was surprised to learn how good their food was and our server chris is excellent too must try in shanghai for fine dining try the signature cocktails too, looking for a spectacular meal in an incredible space on the bund this is it the atmosphere is very romantic with amazing views of the litup pudong skyline creative and delicious choices  we loved every dish we ordered service is incredible i will be dreaming of this dinner for years to come, to dine alone is sometimes not the easiest but the hakkasan service is rather particular and one might guess used to the solo traveler  from the welcome to the serving a fantastic experience

the food well that is the first reason why one goes to hakkasan and it definitely does not disappoint i had time for a fast meal and went with the dim sum the house one
what a delight
must say my old fashion was very well served and the service kept me in good company the all time

highly recommend solo with one or even many
enjoy

coming back soon, there are a lot of restaurants in shanghai where they claim they can cook but ive been disapointed a lot ive not been disapointed with hakkasan had dinner there lots of times not only is the food stunning the decor is trendy and classy service outstanding nice bar area with a beautiful vieuw the only minus that i have found they dont serve a good red wine by the glas for a normal price, whether with friends or business related this restaurant will make a good impression in your shanghai visitors the food is very good and the venue is elegant and impressive price wise is not cheap so reserve hakkasan for important occasions, it is very different from the larger property in las vegas although the concept is consistent perhaps none can be said with the quality of food versus the exorbitant pricing the menu items are relatively creative in presentation however it lacks the palate to substantiate the creativity theres a bit of novelty in the food given that alot of the basic chinese items are basically spiced up in presentation that said it is a stilla good experience to dine there once for the ive been there seen it and done it, heard quite a lot of good things about hakkasan and therefore had to try it first impression was not very good as my reservation was for 730pm our arrival time was 725pm and we had to wait 20 minutes at the nonsmoking bar before showing us to the table we had two kids with us and the first table given was by the smoking bar although requesting for another table only took 5 minutes so dont really know if making us wait for 20 minutes was to prop up the bar sales
now the food dimsum with caviar scallops all prepared wonderfully with fresh ingredients roast duck pancake with caviar looked also very nice but the flavors just clashed in your mouth as duck is already quite flavorful on its own but the duck skin was very crispy and not too fatty 2nd way prep duck meat was okay steak m3 with foie gras cod with satay sauce sweet and sour pork crisp on the outside and tender inside and e fu noodles with abalone sauce all done nicely and seasoned wellsauce didnt over power the dish and can taste the fresh ingredients lastly they have quite an extensive wine list to choose from
hakkasan serves very good chinese food presented in a fancy and appealing fashion to be very objective one can get the same well prepared fair for less but their service and ambiance is just really superb the wait staff was very conscious of my daughters nut allergyonce informedwhere he really checked with the kitchen on which dishes contained any peanut oilingredients and would point it out to us upon serving didnt have to request refilling of our wine as we ordered a bottle change and clearing of plates were done like clockwork all in all very good experience for my wedding anniversary celebration, the food in hakkasn is good even very good but if youre traveling to shanghai from europe or north america then go for some authentic chinese food where the locals go at a minimum avoid this international take on chinese food in a night club setting you can get the same food any any of the other hakkasan restaurants around the world and the ambiance is more suited to las vegas, eating in the bar area is a special occasion the food is terrific the deputy sommelier was charming pricey but worth in, this restaurant offers a beautiful view on the bund this was a great place for both the food and the atmosphere of the place the food is extremely interesting service is topnotch servers are wellpresented and managers are polite if you want to have the view you need to reserve window table, modern cantonese cuisine at its very best tasty wellprepared and excellently presented and served by topquality attentative staff in very nice surroundings at the best location in shanghai and at very reasonable prices
what more could you wish for nothing dine at hakkasan at least once while you are in shanghai reserve in advance and ask for a table with a view spectacular, the worldrenowned restaurant group opened hakkasan in shanghai in 2014 the menu is not much different from the other hakkasan restaurants in other countries the visitor will find on the menu the same approach to authentic cantonese dishes from its renewed signature to local tailored dishes designated as �shanghai seasonal specialties��
latticed woodwork atmospheric light shanghai locals and international guests mark out the restaurant on �the place to beeat list�
the �luxury dim sum platter� is a dish you don�t want to miss on your menu order along with the soft shell crab which was fresh and meaty
comparing to other restaurants in shanghai the waiter at hakkasan speak perfect english offer impeccable service and surprise the guests with entertaining skills when it comes to dessert
comparing to other hakkasan the decor is not much into detail and the bar is not as impressive as in dubai however the food is much tastier than in dubai and abu dhabi, back since it was so good last february we find it to be the same concerning taste just the presentation wasnt as nice as last time  and we had 7 different dishes so we can compare will be back though great tasting foodthe wine list is extensiv but careful with some too old white wines on the list which dont last that long
loved the crab and pork belly and 
thanks for the nice table with view, my wife and i are suckers for dim sum from hong kong to london to san francisco we go hunting for the best dumplings when our concierge at the peninsula shanghai suggested to go to hakkasan for dim sum  we were like been there and done that but he was persistent and confident he said with a proud and knowing  almost smirky  smile  the chefs from hakkasan london come here for months to train this is shanghai forget hakkasan london and so we went and indeed the dumplings were the best we have had dim sum in an international sense is a cantonese thing but the shanghainese are equally proud of their dumpling heritage and thats not just for xiao long bao hakkasan shanghai dimsum was another league just when places like yuatcha in london had made us feel we have tasted dumplings  as good as they can get but those notions were set aside and a new standard was set in our minds for what dimsum can be just incredible for all who have visited hakkasan around the world dont miss this one this is where the others come to learn, we went there for the third time in the last 12 months and it has just been excellent again it was my last evening after two weeks in shanghai and what a way to remember shanghai the food  esp beijing ducksuanlatang cod fish were excellent and with a table facing th bund there is just no better way to enjoy dining in shanghai the staff was also very attentive and helpful, this restaurant offers a beautiful view on the bund
the atmosphere is perfect so the food it can meet all the preferences
interesting fusion dishes
price a bit high but worth for the quality and the service, this was a great place for both the food and the atmosphere of the place

you can see great views of the bund through the windows so just ask for a table over viewing the bund

everything we tasted from the menu and the cocktails was delicious, services ambiance location were all simply the best its one of the trendiest restaurant i have ever visited cant say much on taste as i am not a big fan of chinese cuisine but it was not bad and did tasted good, a trendy restaurant a bit dark though in a great location with a spectacular view and filled with beautiful people the service is very attentive and friendly the food though is a good average but nothing exceptional still great for a special night out, the food is extremely interesting duck with caviar scallop siew mai etc as the restaurant states its modern cantonese cuisine so expect french ingredients cooked cantonese style

service is topnotch servers are wellpresented and managers are polite

in my opinion any tourist should have a try at this restaurant as it does serve up some very interesting dishes but its not a place to keep going back every other week, if you want to try beijing duck with a delightful black caviar on top see a magnificant lights of the bund and get the high service hakkassan is the place to be was trying the one in shanghai las vegas and london and got only positive experience","Chinese cuisine",0.592262670024147
50,"this is my second time to visit jean georges restaurant with my lovely friends when we arrived we thought we go to the wrong place because the restaurant is totally different hostess told us they has been done a renovation compare the previous decoration i prefer present now is more chic and relax we had delicious food and amazing wine the staff was very professional and friendly they will introduce all the dishes the scallops and salmon was my favorite such a wonderful night we enjoyed a lot, went to jean georges for brunch with a group of 10 friends and it was pretty disappointing menu was pricy and food was totally disappointing its like they hired a bunch of hospitality kids straight out of college and said have fun presentation of the food came at the cost of the taste of the food we had a large group so got to taste a massive portion of the menu and of the 10 dishes that i tried id only get the crab risotto again the eggs benedict the french toast the pork  chicken dishes were all pretty tasteless or too cold or too tough or all of the above to top things off our charge for water alone came to about 300 rmb a person more than most places charge for brunch, we had dinner there after being recommended by our hotel they were right the food selection was great they were able to accommodate my wife who is vegetarian the service was excellent the bill was quite steep but it was well worth it, i had to book via the official site before i visited
the view was awesome you can see the bund
the food was good but a portion was small
the price was expensive but deserved it, the quality is as expected but certainly there are a number of european venues in china that dont really translate on service and food quality

this is not one of them though a high quality interior that is finished to provide comfortable levels of acoustics to ensure that there is some atmosphere but that you can still converse with your fellow diners the food and drink on offer are wonderfully presented and whilst the servings are small they are packed with such intense flavour and care that this is certainly not a negative against them

a carefully conceived venue and menu which is certainly one of the best in shanghai, my second time there in shanghai decors newly renovated with an elegant white theme service is good tried their lunch set and worth the price but i would highly recommend the tasting menu if you came a long way there i am not much of a dessert eater but their dessert did surprise me again, first time having western cuisine in shanghai  the food was well prepared and i would consider it on par with any other fine dining restaurants anywhere else in the world we had dinner on xmas day and they only offered the xmas menu which was priced at $1499 rmb pp

most enjoyed
the steak and mash was incredible

least enjoyed
lobster with thai curry this is just a personal opinion as i do not enjoy green curry

the dining experience was excellent but one of the biggest issue was the speed at which the food was arriving dish after dish previously my fine dining experiences food was slowly delivered at an appropriate speed but the food here was delivered as soon as you finish one dish i hear this is not a problem exclusive to this restaurant but also other fine dining restaurants in shanghai, for business dinner i strongly recommend jean georges food is amazing perfect wines selection located in bund you will find european food that you might have in paris
a pleasure for your eyes and taste, absolutely amazing place with exceptional presentation quality food paired with fantastic services the most amazing thing was the servers english abilities since she only looks like coming out from high school
the professional manner she had was a stock to me nice restaurant setting with very good view  roof top pop bar
also had chance to go up the town and feel the outstanding privacy dinner room
a must try , being used to manhattan style restaurant and being from europe i have to say that this restaurant surpassed any expectation by fareach dish meticulously prepared with a level of creativity and freshness of ingredients that rendered this dinner a surprisingly amazing culinary experience not cheap as only prix fix menu is providedbut worth the investment for your taste buds, great restaurant great food and great service everything about this restaurant is first class awesome, its a soothing calm place to have a lovely meal with excellent service the food was good but the service is excellent, this is a upscale restaurant right next to the waldorf hotel our tour group served a multicourse dinner which was at best averagecertainly not worth the price service was good facility elegant but our meal was nothing special my main course was chicken it was dry and lacked any seasoning the other courses were just average i would not expect a restaurant of this caliber to be average, we stayed at the grand kempinski shanghai for couple of days so we where told to dine at jean georges as its place to remember and honestly it was to remember

the place all in white color that you feel so relax and the atmosphere is so good for date food was out of this world where the manager explain all in details service was just perfect and not to fast made us feel super welcoming

after our dinner we had couple of drinks at the main entrance bar was really calm and cocktail were tasteful with energy

place to really remember, <u+4ee5><u+524d><u+5728><u+7f8e><u+570b><u+7d93><u+5e38><u+5230>trump tower<u+7684>jean georges<u+7528><u+9910><u+4e5f><u+8ddf>jean georges<u+672c><u+4eba><u+6709><u+4ea4><u+6d41><u+4e0a><u+6d77><u+5e97><u+98df><u+7269><u+6c34><u+6e96><u+4fdd><u+6301><u+5230>new york<u+7e3d><u+5e97><u+6c34><u+5e73> <u+4f46><u+670d><u+52d9><u+4e00><u+822c> <u+53eb><u+4e86><u+591a><u+6b21>waitress<u+624d><u+4f86><u+4e0b><u+55ae><u+4ea6><u+6c92><u+6709><u+4e3b><u+52d5><u+70ba><u+6211><u+5011><u+6e05><u+7406><u+68f9><u+5b50> lunch set rmb 500 <u+5de6><u+53f3><u+6027><u+50f9><u+6bd4><u+9ad8>, impeccable service unbelievable decor beautiful and most importantly great tasting dishes definitely worth a michelin star when it arrives in china, perfect culinary experience right from the start ordered a gin tonic predinner was asked from an extensive selection of gins well mixed and presented ordered the mebu with wagyu beef which was excellent price was rather high  as one would expect  but definitely worth it, i really love this place  i loved it in its older style even more with its new modern look
it enjoys some of the best view from teh bund it has a lovely atmosphere a great wine lict and a good menu still what you get has left me with a feeling of uncertainity  the feeling that i was not getting what we paid for  and this not a cheap place at all
they try to flatter you but the result is not what youwould expect from such a place 
they refurbished the restaurant  but they should make some major changes in the kitchen  sorry i like you  but you have to perform better , jean georges was the best french restaurant in shanghai for many years until it met with strong competition from le bec and robuchon the atmosphere was modernized this year
the food is still the same modern french very well executed, had dinner at jg twice and lunch once in past three months every time the food was great and service very good as well for dinner i recommend the jean georges menu or the seasonal menu  currently summer wine list is very extensive with wide range of vintages and all price ranges available for lunch the set menu is very good value for money i highly recommend this restaurant, the offerings available include a nice mix of french cuisine with an asian influence all meals are tasteful prepared and presented the quality and flavors are exceptional the service is attentive and professional not inexpensive but the food and surroundings exceed the standard, after a year backpacking we decided to treat ourselves in shanghai and what a treat this was the restaurant is contemporary spacious and relatively informal with a nice atmosphere we opted for the brunch set menu at 300 yuan per person which includes an assortment of delicious brunch options such as eggs benedict smoked salmon with avocado french toast a selection of pastries brioche and a trio of bites to cleanse the palate this also includes a fresh juice and teacoffee as well everything was delicious my only criticism would be the waiting staff who fuss over you a little too much and constantly interupt your conversation great brunch option though, dry bread amazingly bad main course made of a beef tenderloin on top of spicy weird veggies looking like a bad ratatouille turbot was not comestible and dessert was less than average all was confusing with no story line either blend or too heavy or less than average and plating was how to say so uninspiredhopefully some of the textures were fine  overall experience was not even close to a good bistro in tokyo paris or singaporethe menu was the entry one around 678 rmb wine was good service excellentwill come again hoping it was an accidentfor 2400 rmb per head a pretty expensive one, thoroughly enjoyed the location view and food at jean george each course was unique special to experience and delicious i had the filet which was cooked to perfection and wonderful also had the chocolate plate for dessert which was to die for i could go back for that alone, we went already two times before the renovation my wife even three times and were never fully convinced despite the name of jeangeorge von gerichten now to be honest we never visited any of his nyc venues except spice market in tribeca in 2006 and were not overwhelmed but some nyc friends who are better experts than us were multiple times overwhelmed in their visits to one of his nyc venues � so we kept the hope for shanghai and expected that after renovation everything would be great

the location on the bund has been fully refurbished to my pleasure my wife preferred the former atmosphere on the one hand it is a light large eating room with white and clear colors but then you feel warmth by the large very large opulent decorated tables the cosy seats and the dimmed play of lights � overall it is one of the most classy eating rooms in shanghai it its classiness it well grafts the clubhip necessities of an urban dining � views on the mise en place and the grill kitchen the real one is hidden and the bar separated by elegant dimmed glass walls � but all radiating an art deco vibe so on the hardware everything is great � but nothing else on the software

they have three menu options one  very fair  three digits options which allows you to pick among several starters entrees and desserts four in total at a little less than 700 rmb and some more opulent four digit fixed options with seven to nine dishes

we choose the basic option more than enough large servings to gain weight overnight i picked my starter from the caviar option +188 rmb uplift from the base menu � but who cares jgvg is famous for his caviar egg and ordered braised potatoes with tapioca and caviar �and was amazed how a brilliant concept could fell short every foodie knows the idea of combining a robuchonlike potato mash with opulent salty caviar � that can be superumami  so the idea of deconstructing the mash in a geometrical fun potato soup with a spherical small braised potato balls b spherical textures reflecting small tapioca grains and c a brothed liquid butter to combine with d a splash of caviar  would be a wonderful dish but it was not and not for sure not worth its price as a the potatoes were of bad tasteless quality b cooking of the potatoes was not to perfection c tapioca balls were with no context �maybe too cooked d butter broth was just fatty e caviar was not top quality even lufthansa and even �yes emirates serve better grades  the dish came like a great idea but execution was lost in translation 110 because of the price � but even if forgetting this �at best 310

nothing i love more than peas in any form � also in soups so i picked the pea soup with parmesan it was a nice colored foam �but you got the grassy taste of uncooked peas dominating any sweetness you would have expected �but which was not present i was still hoping for the best and justified the grassy splurge by the need to compensate with the creamypungent flavor of the parmesan foam on a soft toast but the more i tasted i had to realize that simply three to five minutes of precision had been spoiled in the kitchen grassy peas plus grassy pea soup plus great parmesan foam does not equal a great dish just a great concept that has been messed by lack of precision

my main dish came with a super uplift on the bill +688rmb for a britanny blue lobster  but fair enough as i asked for� i was allowed to see the beast still living the size was miniature for a britanny blue lobster � but  again  fair enough for the price and the serving of one  the concept was brilliant  it was recreating the original  and for long forgotten  19th century germansaxonian dish of leipziger allerlei originally a stew of crawfish crabbutter  morcels asparagus  peas  cauliflower carrots and miniature dumplings

the intended main course would have been one of the most brilliant modernization of this � today widely forgotten even in germany  grand classic of the 19th century leipziger allerlei so sweetish lobster meat instead of the original crawfish light green vegetable butterjus instead of the crab �butter asparagus as in the original formula  an unknown chinese mushroom instead of morcels green bean seeds instead of peas and lemon flavoured spaetzlesuabian hand crafted thick noodles instead of minidumplings � but everything went wrong a lobster meat was overcooked b asparagus was superovercooked c green beans were undercooked d morcels substituting mushrooms or was it another texture lacked flavor e vegetable jus was watery and bland f spaetzle were overdry  too little and lemon flavor without complexity � just sour  sic transit gloria mundi � a great idea simply failed and was super �expensive� do not try to spend your money on this

the last hope of any miserable highstar dinner is desert � it failed by design it came great as everything what failed this evening a white creamy sphere with a surprise interior the ball was intended to be a great coconut cream inside a tasty surprise of tropical fruit salad should have paired with a passion fruit sorbet the coconut shell was fatty and suelie the finely chopped tropical fruit salad was good but also just average not the full power of really mature tropical fruits and the passion fruit sorbet was ok but without leaving any impression

my wife took the all mignardises and was really pleased  considering this the best part of our dinnershe had different dishes � which we all shared but we could double on the lack of execution of conceptually great dishes � results were poor

breat butter was really good by shanghai standards �but nothing more

service was really nice and kind �but it lacked a real decisive host for justifying those prices

the cocktail was very good super cool ice   the vine list is moderately expensive and the pick i did with the help of the sommelier was great � maybe the best to say about this dinner

for adventurers who are anyhow used to the culinary bundmess maybe it is worth a trial if you are not to scared on the final bill if you refrain from such risky experiments or are really picky on the pricevalue ratio of the food you eat go somewhere else�, so disappointed by jean georges shanghai the egg caviar was bland the caviar was not salty enough and the egg yolk has no flavor so together this turned out to be a rather boring starter the foie gras was good but there was too much of it for such a heavy dish and again with not too much flavor i ordered the duck breast as the main entry the crust was overly sweet and the breast meat again no flavor i honestly can find a better restaurant in any us city with better tasty food more sophisticated presentation and half the price

i dont think jean georges shanghai will ever be given a michelin star

the view is great the decoration very much like the one in nyc but unfortunately the food just doesnt taste good at all dont waste your money here, first return since the refurbishment and we were impressed and modern stylish fit out with an upmarket feel

we chose scallops tuna pepper and crab dumpling and salmon followed by suckling pig and parmesan chicken  the salmon and suckling pig were our stand out dishes which we would order again without question the deserts amusebouche and sorbet were just as good the only dish that we felt had not lived up to the same standard was the but black pepper and crab dumplings which were overpowered by the pepper so could not taste any crab 


having been told it was smart casual dress we were very disappointed to seer that trainers and teeshirts now come under acceptable as smart casual  many of the cliental were wearing them   this did let the restaurant down and made it feel more casual that it should have, restaurant beautifully situated with wonderful night time views of the river decor is very elegant and tasteful the menu offers lots of choices and the wine list was not horribly overpriced the services was impeccable and the staff and chef handled my food allergies with ease our party of four were all very pleased, i always make it a point to visit jg whenever i am in town needless to say i missed it much as the place was closed for renovations since late 2015 n reopens in april

the revamp of the restaurant was first class a brand new look that surely looks like a multi million decor now with amazing private rooms

service is always simply the best staff are familiar to me as i have been a regular for many years

i brought my friend along as it was her 29th birthday i recalled i took her to jade 36  shangrila hotel when she turned 19 omg  how time flies

she was blown away with the place the service  n of course the food

we decided on a three course set  it didnt disappoint us

each dish was professionally presented n explained to us

i had the beautiful sea urchin followed by foie gras  suckling pig all pretty good although i must admit the suckling pig was very similar almost identical to the one i had  mercato sister restaurant serving italian

thanks to jenny for presenting a birthday cake for my beautiful friend the nights are getting better here n surely i will be back again soon

always a memorable evening like no others, we attended a dinner party for a large group but with tables set for 46 people the menu was exceptional with a variety of very interesting selections the service was quick and attentivebut the meal was just tremendous i had the suckling pig and it was great i would highly recommend this restaurant right around the corner from the waldorf astoria on the bund and just a final thoughtour experience was the service was wonderful contrary to the other reviews, my wife and i went to jg this past weekend and loved it we had been previously before the renovation as well as to mercato and two of his nyc restaurants

this meal compared very favorably to our other meals at jg and was leagues better than when we dined there before the renovation

the staff was very attentive without being too much very well informed about the menuservice and communicated very well while this should be taken for granted in a restaurant such as this it has been our experience in china that that is not always the case so i want to make special mention here eddison sp was our server and did a fantastic job

on to the food and we were blown away the sea urchin starter was one of the best dishes ive ever had and my wifes blue lobster was extraordinary the crab dumplings were an excellent mix of eastwest as well

again our experience pre renovation was not this good pre renovation we enjoyed the food but did not think it made it to the level of other jg restaurantsexperiences im very happy we gave it another chance and whatever issues they were having before renovating were changed as well

highly recommended if you are in shanghai, very complicated menu
all personnel does not understand correctly english language it looks like high level restaurant but service is terrible we ask for a table for 8 but they said that they cannot put together 2 tables together when we arrived there were 2 empty table for 8
management should really look for better training and organization but shanghai is plenty of good restaurant so jg is not the only choice, terrible services the chinese waiter didnt take well my suggestion about the taste she said that laowei foreigners just aside us liked the food and it was maybe my fault that i wasnt used to european fine cuisine fyi i am a french born chinese very expensive for what it was we wont go back there, very excited to visit the newly renovated jeangeorges despite the fact that the restaurant was ony a third full the service was slow and clumsy a vegan non gluten guest requested olives instead of bread she was advised there were none this despite them featuring on the menu the food was indubitably excellent but wjy a fixed 3 course menu with amuse bouche and pudding so difficult to manage requirements for all appetites and nobody was hungry by pudding a simple request from a diabetic for a sugar free alternative was met with a flat no fresh fruit surely possible no at this price unforgivably amateurish and evening spoiled by anxiety about length of dinner, having dinned at jean george in new york i was excited to experience the newly renovated location on the bund i was initially disappointed that we had a set menu but after the first bites so over that the three amuse bouche set the stage for an exception evening of gastronomical delight we did initiialy feel rushed but after a quick work with the manager all was perfect
the fois gras matched with a granola topping sounded odd but was actually a very interesting crunch which complemented the creaminess of the fois gras beautifully
highly recommended for a special evening, a world class restaurant which fulfills your expectations excellent service wonderful food we truly enjoyed it, from the moment you enter the restaurant you just know that you are in for something special the service is impeccable and the food is of the highest standard comparable with great restaurants around the world good but pricey wine cellar
the views across the river to pudong are sensational
what a way to spend an evening, i was expecting more from the foods in that price range i remembered having some pasta and pizza to share with friends and it was ok the place is nice with a nice waiting and lounge bar area good view of the bund, the restaurant is one of the best restaurant in the city having a stunning view of the bund the food is fine and surely what we could expect it is jean georges i prefer the weekend bruch which is very good and very affordable, i visited jean georges for a family lunch we truly enjoyed this culinary fine dining experience great service delicious food and beautiful atmosphere

simply perfect, i almost fifteen days staying in china last time was in chinese kitchen in hongkong and this time i made chinese friend in shanghai city he invited me to this french restaurant foods were excellentbut unfortunately the service is not approach with tasty foodsespecially sauces were perfect i enjoyed my lunch time thanks to my new friend and jean georges chef, most foodies know about the lunch at jeangeorges which is often cited as the best value in fine dining

one of the great things about 3michelin starred jean georges at the trump tower in new york is that the hospitality begins as you get out of the car even before you enter the restaurant here in shanghai the service is professional and confident throughout

this glorious restaurant at three on the bund has high ceilings and tall windows which were lovely while the sweeping view of the bund outside through the windows provided a nice contrast to the color scheme

from the simplest dish of sea scallops with caramel used cauliflower caperraisin emulsion to the roasted beef tenderloin potato blintz applejalapeno puree all the dishes fell just short of wowing me don�t get me wrong it was still good but was it omfgiwillsellmychildrenandmysoultoeathereeveryday good can�t say it my lips don�t lie

i�d take jia jia tang bao over jeangeorges any day star or no star this is the true truth as i say it as it is�, we ate here on our third night in shanghai  were blown away by the meal the service  the view we did ultraviolet and it was definitely a 5 but if i had to choose one of the 2 this would win it was $600 vs $2400 too the staff was exceptional from the moment we arrived their english was very good and it was easy to communicate requests for no garlic and onions if possible our view of the pudong was new to us because we were staying on that side at the ritzcarlton the beautiful lights  boats i the water were mesmerizing while our tastebuds were working on the complex rich tastes of lemongrass soup kingfish sashimi with a light dusting of pecans foie gras brulee crab risotto king prawns in lemon saffron duck breast with jordan almonds and the best maine lobster ive ever had we had a perfect bottle of 2008 st emillion grand cru dessert was almost too much but you cannot resist their signature jean georges chocolate cake with ice cream it was heavenly we understand tonight is the last month they are open for a couple of months for a remodel it is already perfect do we cannot imagine how amazing it will be after the remodel enjoy, we had a nice business dinner at this restaurant the atmosphere is more upscale and business oriented which was perfect for us not the same upscaled atmosphere you will find at jg in ny
the food was amazing everything from flavours to textures
the service was also very good
the wine list was ok i rate it 6 out of 10
the restaurant is located in a nice area in shanghai, i came here for a special birthday brunch with my best friends and it was a very enjoyable time however for a restaurant as prestigious as jean georges is known to be i wouldve expected a little more�something�the reality they offered was great but of course my higher expectations of it resulted a little disappointment
the meal itselffor brunch is really quite exquisite i ordered a 258rmb set with foie gras brule and seared black cod the foie gras was creamy and decadent very excellentamong the best ive eaten the black cod fell a little short after the foie gras but it was seared well and paired nicely with snow peas and almond milk i probably wouldn�t order the cod again
my friends ordered a brunch set with pancakes french toast eggs benedict and salmon i had a taste of the french toast and it was like a sponge dipped in milk coated with a thin surface of butter and sugarsimply scrumptious i am unsure how the other components of their meal was but it looked great too
i think however my favorite part of the brunch other than being with my friends was that the waiters offered us with an endless supply of house made bread there were two choices sourdough or fruit bread both i would buy if sold in a store i must have eaten four pieces of each the sourdough went great with the foie gras
long story short this place is more suited for those with heavier wallets and although it wasn�t as good as i�d envisioned it to be it was still among the best restaurants experiences i�ve had furthermore the service is outstanding, great service and food when we were there staff couldnt do enough to make us feel welcome super atmosphere especially for special occasions the food was delicious and there is a very extensive wine list to chose from i will definitely be returning on my next visit to shanghai, we decided to have our dinner in shanghai at the jean georges reastaurant so glad we did the food was fantastic from the appetizer untill the dessert the staff was attentive and knowledgeable we really enjoy the atmosphere and service i will be back with my friends for another great experience, i brought customers in this very popular restaurant and in addition to having eaten badly i do not get in return even courtesy it never happened in shanghai to eat so bad in a place known to be one of the best restaurants of the city
i do not care if the synchronized choreography of the dishes  then the food is not even good, jean georges are so famous for not need long explanation service was literally perfect enough but food quality wise want for old time, we were so looking forward to our evening here but the service was sketchy wine orderingserving was not smooth our group of 7 only about 3 really enjoyed their entree those that ordered steak said it was tough and not tempting salad was average but the dessert was excellent the dining room is elegant and comfortable keep looking for a more exciting meal","vegetarian restaurant",0.999066979545926
51,"its been a long time since i had a meal this memorable which is kind of ironic as ive forgotten all the dishes proper names but alas the food was nothing short of amazing i ended up with the truffle soup for a starter which is basically the elixir of life frothed and foamed to absolute perfection for the main it was the steak on a bed of mashed potatoes swimming in a pool of wine sauce the meat was so tender you could have sliced through it with spoon and the flavors were complex but at the same time familiar lastly for desert i rewarded myself with the apple dish it was really nice the apples were cooked wonderfully and it was just the prefect amount of sweet to end an already stunning meal i know for sure this will be one of my regular eats from now on in shanghai well done cuivre, delicious food and attentive staff we were taken as guests to this lovely french restaurant and had a delicious meal the menu had lots of choices which included truffles  a personal favourite  so i was a very happy diner, cuivre has become my favourite place to have a pleasant dinner whenever i am in shanghai authentic french cuisine though cooked perfectly and in a very modern manner a cosy and warm atmosphere and last but not least a very friendly team to welcome their guests and provide them with the most professional service

i strongly recommend cuivre, we love going there with the kids friends and even dont hesitate to bring our french family when they visit us the food is good and hearty the croque monsieur from the brunch is simply addictive i like the choice of drinks decor friendly and simple service and the play room for the kids, stayed a week in shangai and this has been my favorite place we were nicely welcomed and the place is decorated with taste both lamb and beef were fantastic the sauce and the meat were really topnotch the prices are not cheap but its totally justified for this quality as reference we paid less in cuivre than in the nest where food was also great but seemed a bit too pricey for starter+main+wine+dessert then its all about little details and surprises youll find there like the fact they have designed their own scent for their restaurant wouldnt go back to shangai without stopping there , after coming to australia is when i start to realise how tender the red wine beef was in cuivre how tasty the beef tartar was even the sauce of a simple salad is made with heart not just plain olive oil and vinegar chef michael used to say food is made with a lot of love i didnt understand that until i came to australia this country is nice people are easy too easy on their food though lol will definitely go back a lot to cuivre when i return to shanghai love your food chef~~, a bit weird to go dine in a french restaurant in shanghai a very friendly host and staff serve delicious dishes in a fine environment, great selection to brunch theres something there for everyone atmosphere very family friendly and service was great, i have been coming to cuivre for the past 18months fanny and mike are amazing hosts and will never disappoint you come for a romantic dinner or a boozier brunch everyone at cuivre will always make you feel like you are home, love the food and welcoming of the chef mike and fanny very great and tasty food i recommend that place for all of those who want to experienced something different, when i lived in shanghai i would visit cuivre weekly not only for the great food decor and ambiance but also for the warm friendly atmosphere which you feel immediately when entering china service is known for being a bit unfriendly but michael and fanny have found a great group of locals to support their goal of providing a friendly place to relax for a great meal and conversation

dont get me started on the food delicious

it is always my first meal when returning to shanghai, one of the must visit restaurant in shanghai as we all know in this metropolis city  shanghai its changes and refreshing all the times with something surprising every time when i m back in shanghai there are always new places to dinning to partying to chilling and to discovering but one thing never change  dinning and brunching in cuivre

always a new journey for me to dinning thereim a healthy eaterlow cab foie gras with fresh veggies plus just a little nice chef creations = big smile cozy place to have some wine with friends and enjoying a bit chit chat in the romantic french concession to me this place is just like a getaway from the crowd in town

when i m with my family in town my daughter is the one who always decided where to go for the sunday brunch  she love cuivre the food is absolutely her taste she love t for thai 2nd floor from cuivre cause the kids playground over there really knock her out she loves it to drawing to playing to basteln etc etc

thank you cuivre we love to growing with you we are looking forward to see you in 2017, i have over the last 12 years visited and enjoyed many excellent top restaurants in shanghai and in cuivre have found a new top favorite
the food service and environment was a 1010 be assured that i and my friends will be back, ok french restaurant not a lot of selection and cold environment they can do much better base on the price they charge, one of the best french restaurant in town food was good good bordeaux wine and the service was good too to be advised, wide selection and good value on sunday brunch menu the top up for the terrine was well worth it but for the steak not so much lovely ambiance and overall very good quality of food we thought the salad croquettes pasta and chocolate mousse were excellent good sized portions for sharing were provided the french toast was amazing on top but slightly soggy below which was the only small let down service was casual and friendly even though the restaurant was busy, go here if you want to experiment a very tasty and good quality food in a very nice and modern atmosphere
le cuivre this is my third dinner here keep the same level of quality and service
for chinese friends  you will for some hours travel to the french grande cuisine spirit choose an affordable bottle of wine enjoy and surprised yourself, we were walk ins and didnt quite know what to expect and boy were we pleasantly surprised the food was excellent the service top notch and a great wine list interesting decor with bicycles as bar stools clearly a hip place for the shanghai yuppies to eat at as it was quite full for a weekday will definitely go back heard great reviews about the thai restaurant on top of the cuivre run by the same management, adviced by french colleagues i went for a business diner staff correct food excellent typically french and really good taste, this french restaurant is a cool trendy venue in shanghai the chef michael has successfully merged authentic french flavours and classics with the twist of asian notes loved the foie gras with its sweet and sticky plum sauce the amazing mushroom truffle soup its foamy goodness and meaty scallops the desserts were incredible the apple tatin was like a delicious bb pudding with caramlised apples atop chocolate souffle finished with a shot of limoncello the chef is friendly and bubbly guy who is very welcoming highly recommend, the restaurant is centrally located on huaihai road close to the shanghai library metro station line 10 the food tasted great and was professionally presented by competent wait staff the menu also includes a comprehensive wine list note that cuivre is closed on tuesdays, friend of mine told me this place before i headed to shanghai the food was really delicious with reasonable price one of the best food i have ever had they also has various wine selections if you dont know what to order ask the staff or owner they are very friendly people defiantly will come back again, the best restaurant in shanghai exceptional foie gras and beef tenderloin super friendly welcome and service thank you , 5 years in chinabest meal to date the black pig and scallop carpaccioamazing service was impeccable, one of my fav restaurant in shanghai ive been living in this city for many years now and whenever i need a break from local food or home cooking i would go there perfect for romantic dinner or an evening with some fiends my kids love their sunday brunch service is really nice they really want to make everything they can for you to have an amazing time i love the meat there chef really knows his stuff not the cheapest but quality and service are so worth it i can only recommend, cuivre has been around for years and is managing to reinvent itself regularly the menu is updated seasonally and the owners were there every time i had lunch or dinner there

very kid friendly on sunday brunch with the kids playroom upstairs and good mix of sunday cocktails and comfort food

given the raise on restaurant prices lately its nice to see that they keep their prices stable and try to compete on quality not fanciness

only downside is service especially when full service can be slow dont hesitate to talk to the manager or owner theyll make your experience more enjoyable

cheers, i have been to several times to cuivre either for lunch or dinner always been very satisfy by food  service which is consistent and high level no wonder it has been voted best french redtaurant in town so many times i would recommend cuivre for date or group of friends brunch is terrific  good value for money just wish one day they could used good quality vodka for bloody mary no comment wine selection is good at reasonable pricing, was there saturday eve the restaurant was less than half full that probably says it all

starters pate were good mains were bad flank steak was though with a sickly sweet sauce on top the black pork was fat and greasy covered in heaps of sauce as well the fillets were so small that they almost drowned in the potato mash dessert was nothing to shout about either wines were good and reasonable priced the rip off water was mentioned several times in other reviewed here

nobody came to ask whether we were satisfied with our food they knew why

skip this restaurant there are far better places in shanghai, love celebrating special occasions at the cuivre with the attentive hosts  delectable dishes everything melts in your mouth great spot as well if you enjoy french cuisine you can choose the bar lounge table or sofa seats, food here is decent for china standard the cod red snapper and beef were well prepared pork was ok but i felt it would be better dish for sharing

one thing we absolutely disliked is the very small table which is extremely difficult and uncomfortable for dinner with glasses plates etc all cluttering up an otherwise decent dining experience, went here with friends waiters wouldnt leave us alone2minutes after giving us a menu hounding us for an order take one sip of wine topping you up making you feel awkward mains disappointing duck foie gras insulting portion and sides disgustingtian legumesgross however puds delicious so many better places to go in the city, great relaxed atmosphere with great food we had a business  friends diner and this was a really great mix of business and private dining best risotto in town, ate here one evening with some business collogues
the management was very friendly and gave the restaurant a great welcoming atmosphere
the restaurant was busy but with the way the tables were laid out we were still able to talk business without being overheard by other people
the food was excellent and not too expensive the service was just right i couldn�t fault this place, the food was good but expensive

when asking why we had been charged 138 yuan21 euro 23 us dollarsfor water we had been offered by the waiter the manager indignantly replied that we should have known what we were ordering as all of the prices are listed on the menu

we had not ordered evian from the menu we had simply accepted the waiters offer of water when we sat down and again half way through the meal this experience did not leave us with a good feeling when leaving, it was extremely difficult to find the restaurant location was very poor food was quite average and the staffs were not well trained for customers expectation wine list are limited by french selection
no value and we were very disappointed, i hear about this place from friend but sincerely is a poor location and the food they have is nothing special wine list is also very poor, the short version on the le cuivre  as long as mr mrs bund is closed for renovation this is the only 100 safe bet quality place to get excellent french food in shanghai there are some other french restaurants in shanghai worth a visit but le cuivre has the best consistency on the quality of food in any european city you would dream to have this place as your neighborhood restaurant where you would go regularly at least once a week excellent service including some of the most charming hosts of shanghai

for those who have time now the long version le cuivre is located next to the french consulate and has for good reasons a loyal french customer base walkin is not the best idea especially after 1900 � sometimes even during the week so make a booking we have been there about 6 or seven times in the last months and were always highly satisfied with food drinks and service

the location next to a service apartment complex radiates a wood dominated coasy atmosphere design is not prestige but rather elegant modernscandinavian winter hut style the modern design ordering from an ipad tablecloth free tables and trendy but decent musical background on our last visit there was a nice lineup of late 70s studio 54 alike soundtracks signals a more relaxed atmosphere than some other places with similar great european food on the other hand a decently loose seating warm dimmed lighting and the consistent good food still gives a reason for having here a more formal dinner or a romantic dinner date

the menu is offering a excellent lineup of bistrostyle classical french dishes with reasonable addition of more modern more innovative dishes in the past visits i tried the excellent foiegras for me it is the best in town garlic flavored snails sinfuldelicious truffle soup raw chopped beef tartare and braised pork � each of those dishes was prepared with excellent ingredients and executed in a perfect way the brigade keeps the intented hearty rustic flavors of those well known dishes but execution of the plate presentation the portioning the proportions of the different ingredients the slicing cutting the seasoning and the cooking happens in more modernized way that you learn today in toplevel restaurants one signature move in the execution is that often classical recipes get a decent and subtle dosed addition of one ingredient to give them a fresher or lighter twist finely chopped tomatoes in the garlic snails a hint of mint in the foie gras terrine bell peppers in the chorizo infused mussels such subtle recipe modernizations and the ability to apply modern cooking techniques to the traditional hearty flavors without corrupting them is one of the most rewarding experience in modern european gastronomy of our days at cuivre you get it not only on an excellent level compared to other places in shanghai but also compared to standards in europe

on our last visit we had cold country style pate with sweet melted onion and mustard a king fish ceviche a gratin of chicory and steamed mussels flavored with chorizo we enjoyed all the four dishes 
� the livery taste of the pate was subtle and not gamy seasoning was really good  addition of almonds instead of classical pistachios gave a sweet pinch that i liked
� the taste of the kingfish was rich and fresh the twisting of the seasoning from peruvian to mediteranean was a nice idea the cutting and presentation of tomatoes and raw onions was very precise and reflected a well trained chef
� gratin ingredients � including ham and cheese of the gratin were excellent and both are mostly of horrible quality in most other places in shanghai cooking of the chicory was very precise
� precise fine chopping of the chorizo ensured that the steamed mussels were not overwhelmed but just infused by the meaty smokiness of the sausage

could you critique some parts of the execution �yes but not really just some details on personal taste
� i sensed some starchyness in the pate � which made it looking more appealing and less gamy and fatty � but compared to the pate of my grandmother also a little dryer
� the cream or light bechamel of the chicory gratin was a little more liquid than i know it from home my wife said that this is better for her as the dish was lighter and fresher  i liked it but a little higher viscosity and less juicyness could have been even better for me � but this is really a detail

one of the highlights of this restaurant are the excellent hosts  in a city where good hosts are so rare and even more rare than good chefs  i know from hundreds of restaurant visit � not much more than five fanny and also celine yesterday are excellent welcoming advisors to their guests drink list is well structured and you get really good wines at decent prices for this town trust the host to pick the right bottle for your dishes overall we had an excellent at a very very reasonable price for good quality european food

for a foreigner living in shanghai the local restaurant scene has two narratives the first is to tell the story that this city has attracted some of the greatest gastronomic talents of china but also from the rest of the world especially when visa applications were easy during the expo that shanghai has got a buoyant restaurant scene where you can nearly get every cuisine of china and the world and that you will find some of the most spectacular innovative coasy and stunning food places by global standards that in this city i had of my best sushi outside tokyo my best steak outside the us and japan by greatest innovative dinners my best pacific rim courses outside california�

but there is also another narrative which is about the fact that even in upscale places the lack of good vocational training spoils the consistency of quality of local service staffs and chefs that a lot of highly performing restaurant see a sudden decay of their quality because a key chef or host leaves the town that instable supply hinders constant quality of ingredients and that drink list and kitchen purchases are challenge by the omnipresence of counterfeits especially of wine and spirits that entrepreneurs are challenged to maintain quality because of a utterly restrictive visa extension policy for expatriates who are so important to keep quality in the kitchen and in service � that shanghai restaurant scene seems sometimes to performs poorly not only compared to new york  tokyo paris and london but also to singapore berlin and bangkok

both narratives are true for me � but in both moods le cuivre is a star which hopefully will keep on shining  when i get my frustrated and depressed mood on the bad situation of the shanghai food scene because a newly highly mediatized upscale restaurant proves to be a deception or when a former great place proves to have suddenly decayed my wife says lets go tomorrow to le cuivre to improve your mood, a little noisy but nice environment with french atmosphere
you can find here some very typical french food i had here their very good endives au jambon that i did not eat since a long time the bavette was served with a sweet sauce that we did not like but the quality of the meat was excellent
good selection of french wines, its been quite a long time since ive visited this placewe used to come reasonably often but found the menu becoming static and never really offering any new delights thats not to say the food wasnt any goodquite the oppositeit had always been quite fantastic though once the chicken dish i had was really too oversized and the meat the texture of an old henand the steak dish was really too chewy

anyway thats definitely all in the past now i happened to be invited to a private wine event being held here so the menu was naturally set to complement the wines being shown however i did grab an ipad from a friendly waiter to check out the latest a la carte menu offering after all this timeand though i wasnt really surprised to see that nothing had really changed much looking over the menu actually brought back many fond memories of previous wonderful dining experiences hereand i felt heartened that here at cuivre good thingsgood foodreally do survive

the dishes we tasted alongside the chateauneuf du pape wines were all quite phenomenal and the foie gras dish an absolute star and yes we also had a really noble beef dish lined up with a couple of deep and meaningful reds wow superb

service always tends to be friendly and warmand although there is a nice warm glow from the lighting in the eveningsthe only gap in the total entertainment experience  from welcome to service to food to beverages and wines is that the place could really do with a touch of lounge music preferably with a french twist to create a better foundation of experience  but not noisy stuff

oh yesi really dont find their wine list too attractive while its really hard to create a short concise wine listinstead of a tome you find in some places i think it could be improved with better glass selections and more appropriate varietalsand i think they would be better off keeping it to frenchonly selections im australianand very proaustralian wines but i just dont get it why australian wines are shown in this wonderful french cuisine place

make sure you try cuivre enjoy the white bean soupthe chacuteriethe foie gras dishesthe beef dishesavoid the middleoftheroad australian wines offeredjust go french, we had a very pleasant and leisurely sunday brunch you can choose to have a 3 course or ala carte i went for the eggs benedict and the others had the steak  fries both were good choices i was tempted to try the chocolate mousse which you will want to protect from fellow diners it had white chocolate shaving topping off a most rich and smooth preparation no regrets there coffees were had to round off the meal we stayed in the restaurant for almost 2 hrs chatting and we werent being harried to leave good attentive wait staff and very warm pleasant atmosphere
a great way to enjoy sunday brunch, foie gras terrine dish is the one that keeps bringing me back to this place superbly done very good red  white house wine too, located in the center of shanghai this is a very classy restaurant interesting decoration good french food still a little bit too expensive they do brunches on sundays, first impressions of the restaurant are very positive it is situated in the coveted french concession district and is next door to its sister bar the layout is spacious and comfortable with soft lighting the staff welcome is warm the menu is interesting with some dishes having an italian influnece eg the beef carpaccio and risotto i had the carpaccio as a starter my friend took the foie gra he was not too impressed mine was decent for main course i went for the black cod whilst he went for the steak again both were acceptable without being exceptional at the price this felt somewhat poor value compared with other french restaurants in shanghai, i like cuivre a lot and have been multiple times for dinner and brunch the atmosphere is really special  its simple but comfortable and chic you browse through an ipad menu of french favorites and everything ive ordered has been delicious sometimes the dinner can be a little expensive and the portions a little small so expect to pay for it the brunch deals are very good though overall i always have a great experience with friends and family, we decided to have our goodbye dinner for one of our friends leaving shanghai in cuivre it has been 68 months that we have not been back and we were looking forward to experiencing another memorable dinner evening and cuivre delivered  and more

chef michael weldings food is very good very consistent same quality as 68 months ago we ordered all the specials the truffle soup the truffle risotto and lobster risotto everything was fantastic  this restaurant is a must to bring visitors and goodbyewelcome parties

we are looking forward to our next visit when we return to shanghai, friendly service and exquisite cooking
trifle soup is always pleasant and by beef was perfectly medium and great texture with red wine sauce
i wish i had more choices on main course but i understand they concentrate what they are good at
we ordered two french fries on the side so regrettably too full to try sweets
we got comp grilled cheese since one of us is regular there , this is the second time i have eaten at this restaurant food is well prepared but the service could be improved the local waiters were not too attentive and were not helpful in selecting wine or menu items i had to call in the owner fanny to help me with the menu, i discovered this place while living in shanghai as it was located not that far from my flat i went there in different occasion and although not cheap i did enjoy the food the atmosphere and also the owners style in managing the business strongly recommended especially for business dinners, this restaurant is just 3 min walk from the subway stop shanghai library and the interiour is nice and welcoming wooden floors cosy seating along the window and nice trees outside the windows we went for brunch on a sunday and really did enjoy the selection of three diffrent choices plus one coffee or smoothie total just under rmb per person
personally i must say that you have to make sure to order the right stuff otherwise you will leave hungry or reorder other things which we did my recommendation start with the aubergine salad then take the eggs benedict and finish with the mousse the smoothies are great and order a coffee and some bread for some bucks extra that will fill you up until you get home, great restaurant great food great atmosphere slightly impersonal service highly recommended good wines by the glass

52,"we couldnt speak only english but denny was served kind to us so we could enjoy afternoon teawe wanna come here again thanks, this is the right place to go with your best half in shanghai the music and the view create a unique romantic atmosphere the drinks are amazing but too expensive but it worth it to the lovely moments that i had, happened to hear about the lunch buffet offered and as im always anxious to have another ritz carlton experience i gladly went for lunch the next day

fantastic view 52nd floor on the bund great attentive service nice dishes teapot and the sushi buffet was good especially for the very low price i think it was 160rmb selected a nice bordeaux that i thought was well priced for the quality 700rmb and spent a couple lovely hours feeling relaxed and thoroughly transported to a pampered world

the one negative was that one of the managers was hosting some sort of reviewer at the next table which was an intrusion as they should have been more isolated to preserve the mood but i chalk that up to that manager rather than the employees working in the restaurant area all wonderful, fantastic view the right relax atmosphere also for non resident in hotel perfect for indulgent break between the tiring shopping and walk around the service is good on the expensive side the quality of service detail can improve but some imperfection is still worth the good feelings of the overall high end experience , when it comes to fish in china it is always in good hands the cook had the cod perfectly cooked
the staff were very attentive and detailoriented, food is nice view  service are great
staff care about customer needs decent selection of wines fair price smart casual  comfortable environment, perfect place to relax with a glass of wine and some snacks gorgeous view classy live performance late into the night service was great from the team especially denny very pleasant and professional, sushi buffet lunch was great and view was nice tracy was excellent and had great customer service worth recommend to friends, very welcoming and friendly staff here at aura we came as a treat for afternoon tea tiki allowed us to sit early and order our afternoon tea a little early so helpful amazing views and excellent food perfect for a treat, excellent service unbelievably prepared food very comfortable lounge environment i really think this is one of the best environments of any lounge i have ever been too during the week they have all you can each sushi for about 160 rmb must visit in shanghai, went here for my last night in shanghai to have a spot of afternoon tea and some snacks in the evening

the bar itself is very nicely appointed nice decor giving off the jazzy vibe that the music seeks to create although the lighting was a touch on the low side at dusk even for me as an appreciator of mood lighting it was a tad dark a little more lighting at the table would help to ease this problem

the afternoon tea was good very nice tea and good scones which ive found hard to find in china however there is a tiny amount of cream and jam supplied so we had to ask for more scones should be covered in cream and jam so the amount they gave us was not enough they happily provided more when asked

we also ordered the club sandwich which was decent but not toasted enough chips were excellent though

the service was excellent staff spoke good english and were attentive but not invasive and the view of shanghai and the bund is excellent especially at sunset, i was looking for a nice comfortable stylish place where to get a good lunch while taking a break from my crazy week i literally stumbled upon this graceful beautiful jazz bar on sunday with an amazing view of shanghai 
i had a great lunch very high quality steak and amazing dessert  chocolate cake i guess  i was still working a little so i decided to take a hot tea and relaxing while writing down some notes listening to the live classical music piano e cello playing beautifully time flew literally  as i was sitting on the couch just in front of the window  i had an amazing view of the city
i suggest you to visit this venue for a relaxing time surrounded by a great and unique atmosphere amazing service and good food  the afternoon tea is a must   thanks to michelle her and her team are delivering a successful and impeccable service see you soon , popped up to level 52 aura bar for lunch did not stay at the ritz and for the views beautiful views across shanghai delicious food service not as attentive as expected but more than happy to help once i caught their attention cost lunch was caprese salad starter sushi starter tiramisu dessert water 2 small bottles and 2 glasses of laurent perrier champagne = rmb 1117 or ~$230 aud limited wine list by the glass i expected a better selection high tea is served from 1pm and pianist with flute and violin starts at ~230pm, visited back last week in a nice day warmly greeted and recognized by the manager michelle and arranged a very nice seat with great view the service staff is so friendly and motivated which made me felt fully cared my client also enjoyed all of everything, came here for dusk drinks and really enjoyed it the view was phenomenal probably the best in shanghai and the service of the staff were great the cocktails i had were great

try and go for happy hour 530730 if you would like to not burn so much of a hole in your pocket but high prices is what you expect at the ritzcarlton, went late afternoon for a burger and a view was very crowded so they seated us near the bar in a pretty busy aisle the burgers and wine all wound up to be ritz carlton good but the wait staff did not speak much english each time i would order something from the menu it was repeated back to me with a question at the end  may i have the burger cooked medium her response was you want a burger i repeated it again and on the third try i responded yes the burger on the menu and showed it to her we finally got our food and enjoyed the meal maybe she was new i think this could be a pass as it is just food and everyone there seemed to be chinese and had camped out at the tables sprawling across chairssofas as if they were planning to stay quite a while i guess they wanted to get their moneys worth, fantastic afternoon tea with nice servicefoodmusic warmly served by amiee the girl whos always smiling and paying attention to us the weather is cloudy but still nice view manager also shows the care via greeting  checking feedback table by table ritz is ritz defiantly will be back with friends again, a wonderful placethis is my second time to go this place called ritz carltonand the attitude of waitress is so nice, we went there for lunch to get a general sense of the hotel to consider staying there on a future trip to shanghai the staff was amazing  even though we werent staying there they all remembered our family name even though we only said it once the food was really nice all the staff was great including one of the managers michelle who was exceptionally helpful  shes a great asset to the propery  her employers should are very lucky to have her, tried the sushi lunch buffet in aura pity that its raining today so couldnt see the outside view besides that everything is value for money the food and the service is really ritz level quality service with great smile our table is served by a girl named summer great smile and excellent service, great afternoon tea with a proper scone and clotted cream the sandwiches change as do the desserts but everything was great, i enjoyed aura on my last visit at shanghai they have a great view on 52th floor great ambiance and live music i also got to chance to meet with supervisor michelle lu she was very professional and even got a dessert as a gift i will definetly come back to this lounge, high tea at the windows overlooking the bund is luxurious experience for the whole family ritz level quality and service at a reasonable price makes this a good value, it was my grandmothers birthday and my mom decided to take us to aura lounge on the 52nd floor for afternoon tea we didnt make a reservation but saw that a window table was empty so we asked the hostess nancy liu if we could have that table she said that the table was reserved at that time so she offered that we could wait until one opened up after about 20 minutes the table that was reserved still did not show up and therefore we asked nancy if they could check if the guest was still coming she refused and said the table was reserved indefinitely for a guest when we requested to speak with a manager she found a random guest to sit at the table and did not offer us any other options or directly indicate to us we could not have afternoon tea there the view is wonderful for the bund but the entire experience was less than what we expect ritz carlton to be we normally have tea there and have less than spectacular service non attentive and indifferent staff but this exceeded our already low expectations of service in the aura lounge, had a terrific experience at ritz carlton singapore and it never stops to amaze me stumbled into this lounge and ended up having a awesome night with my gf views r just incredible from d top and the band is outstanding gotta say d service is so impressive that first time remember a staffs name it was michelle i believe brought slippers for my gf when shes just whining about pain from her heels details says it all, went to aura with a few friends we ordered an afternoon tea set the food was very delicate and tasty michelle the manager is such a nice person she provided us with free fresh scones it was really nice to have a window seat you can get a great view of the bund and the city of shanghai from the restaurant overall nice place nice view nice service will definitely be back again, i always like going to these lobby lounges of fancy hotels to just sit there and sip my coffee with all those lounges ive been to aura lobby lounge has the best view in shanghai usually lobby lounges are located on the first floor but aura is on the 52th floor which is a perfect height to appreciate the whole view of lujiazui whats more since i went there alone ive got a little chat with one of staff named michelle shes pretty and talkative who also fulfilled my every special needs i would love to go there again, we was shopping in ifc while decided to rest for a while in aura we had the afternoon tea and the food was great also i felt amazed about the nice view offered by this place another things impressed me was the excellent service michelle if i still recall correctly who is one of the staff delivered great services for us she helped us switch the seats and explained a lot about the food great experience after all, the service is outstanding the people that provide the service out of this world the details are just a drop in the bucket located upstairs from the ifc afternoon tea highly recommended, i was told aura is a perfect place to have afternoon tea so i went there with 2 my friends last week i had to say the view is really amazing  the staffs dress qibao look elegant  overall nice atmosphere to enjoy couple of tea the manager is a young lady who is helpful also speak very fluent english nice experience  the price is not cheap but i think it worth if you want have a window table suggest to go early  afternoon tea start at 200pm, im working in ifc tower and for us is always not easy to find a good and quite place to have quick lunch i saw an add about what aura quick lunch so went to try with my colleagues well here that why im writing the review beautiful soup amazing choice of noodle freshly made as you can taste from the flavor and texture of it my colleagues try rc burger what an amazing burgerwell i have to said keep it that people like me will sure back
great value for money even rc burger if your budget can go slightly over so nice to see all server with same hair cut and dress look like all are siater, i brought a good friend of mine to aura for its buffet lunch a 3 course set for 160 rmb including drinks you have a choice of about 10 main course and i chose the pork over crispy noodle dish the plating in places like these are as usual visually appealing the ambiance and views from the window seat was simply stunning a magnificent panoramic view of the bund alas the food was very average and they had to be reminded to bring my drink despite a rather empty place verdict i came for the food and it deserves a  but in future forget about the food go for the view and have a drink instead, my first night in shanghai i went to flair to checkout the view and have a drink i thought it was very good the view was fantastic my negroni was properly prepared the service ok and the bad music was too loud aura is the perfect alternative its two floors below","Spanish cuisine",0.676058494908841
53,"good fresh food at a great location if you are looking for a nice western meal this is an easy choice, this is a place your order and seat style restaurantdeligreen grocer

its a busy busling fun place in the french concession area of shanghai puxi

i was there for a catch up lunch with good old friends we had a few ipa s and relaxed and chatted the burger i had was their signature burger and was delicious my friend had the same and his wife had the salad selection which i tasted and all 3 were delicious especially the thai chillie beef

i would definitely recommend this spot, the first time i stumbled upon green  safe was for a search of a cafe with outdoor seating as the weather was nice we found this place sat outside and ate very tasteful salads with juice and coffee this seems to be a great spot for doglovers who all came to sit outside with their dog the restaurantcafebar also has a little shop inside with mostly organic food they sell a variety of cake and focus on steak and international beer in a more rustic atmosphere in the seating area upstairs the second time we came back for my boyfriends birthday for a casual meal with friends we sat upstairs and quickly found a large table however it took quite a while for it to be cleaned up there were a few confusions with which food and drink is actually available and as you have to go to the till first to order the delivery of food at our table was quite messy we still had a joyful evening but i would primarily come back for a quick lunch the pasta pesto salad and the steak was especially nice the prices fair and i would highly recommend, the location is very special on two floors when you are visiting shanghai you have to go there fancy atmosphere you feel home between selfmade tables and shelves full of cookingbooks all the food and drinks are in a excellent quality and very delicious have been there a few times allways quite something on the first floor in the restaurant there is mini market with organic food wine cheese fresh bread , a group of 8 of us visited here for a friends birthday and sat in the upstairs restaurant which is very pleasant the ordering system is simple enough to understand you tick the things you would like from the paper menu which is extensive and very appealing take the menu to the cashier pay and then take back to your table a number and a receipt where your food and drink will be delivered

although this system was easy to grasp it quickly became apparent that it was wholly unsuitable to a party of even a modest size such as ours because people ordered at different times and there was no distinction between startersmains etc on the menu it meant the food was coming out randomly at different stages in different orders and there was much confusion in terms of which food matched which persons ticket it was absolute chaos the servers did their best but the system they were working with caused the problem

however a special mention must be given to the young barman working alone who im sure couldnt have worked slower if he tried we were sat next to the bar so saw him work at less than a snails pace to make such difficult drinks as a pint of lager on numerous occasions he had left our drinks on the bar unattended for 510 minutes waiting for them to be picked up by waiting staff in the end we just got up and collected them ourselves better training and more urgency would be welcome

overall delicious fresh food and an excellent choice of beers and ciders but i would not come back with a group of more than 4 at most, i went there with 2 friends and we had a really good time plenty of choice in terms of beer and wine i enjoyed the triple karmeliet served in the proper glass nice jazzy music in the background and an informal athmosphere where you can enjoy a good conversation i ordered a spaghetti carbonara which was ok but not exceptional my friends had pizzas and they had the same opinion, located in the former french concession near hengshan road this restaurant is serving all kind of dishes with vegetables and meat from bio producers thus its name green  safe with the pollution and food safety issues in china it is nice to have such a place in shanghai serving delicious and fresh western food during weekend it can be very crowdy, i really enjoyed my meal at this place 

as vegetarian i had a lot of choices and i love the decoration in this restaurant courses were good also the drinks

i certainly will come back, i visited the xintiandi branch of greensafe in xintiandi located next to the paulaner xintiandi food is fresh and tasty prices are reasonable for the good quality served i find their ordering system a bit strange on each table are two lists with meals and drinks you have to mark your selection then go to the cashier hand her our list and pay your bill then return to your table and wait for your food and drinks then being served rather fast the athmospere is quiet and relaxed the restaurant looks like a barn i will eat there again, we stumbled onto this place while looking for a place to get a light meal glad we found it great quality fresh and high standard of preparation ambience is great  comfortable well staffed and efficient service great place for a lazy afternoon brunch on a weekend seatings available upstairs and downstairs upstairs is cosy and bright next to an open kitchen, very clean eatery on dongping road attracts a lot of western tourists and wealthy locals serving organic and very fresh western food and salads
you will probably wait for a table but the wait will not be too long you complete a tick box style menu order and take to the counter to order food and drinks some of the staff speak broken english

food is very good however the service is lacking in speed and timing of dishes arriving

they serve large selection of salads and breakfast foods and there are some asian options also fresh bread can be purchased and there is an organic shop onsite also, very nice place
the food are very good
the portion arent big but the food is very good
you must choose the food and you need prepaied it, very expensive for a whole foods type of experience food was average i recommend the pork and and vietnamese roll and vietnamese sandwich, this is my new goto place when im in shanghai its rare that i find something in china that i actually enjoy and would trust but i will come back here for sure the food seems to be not only organic but very healthy and fresh with a big range of products to eat lots of expats come here it is clean and i get a good vibe free wifi for those who travel highly recommend, this was the best place to eat in shanghai
french food in a french area in shanghai very posh crowd and gourmet and fresh food high class place in a up class french area
semi self service you select your bite and pay at the counter and the food comes to your table very unique service concept great wines, best steak in china and weve really had our fair share of bad steaks here ordering is a bit different you use a check list and then go to the till and pay bringing back a number for the table drinks are also a really good price would definitely recommend, came back several times for the truffle pizza smoothies and beer were on special great price managers spoke english and very friendly loved the staffs uniform fit the atmosphere wanted to try the seafood platelooked delicious loved the variety of appetizersalads food desserts everything please consider to conserve paper as far as finding a way to not write on each menu, as the name implies a variety of salads and other daily specials that are fresh and delicious also pastas burgers etc on offer with fresh juices teas and coffees and if you have room great berry desserts pick up a sheet look at what is on display or on the boards mark your choices with a pencil choose a drink  desserts and wait for the food to come to you plenty open space downstairs and upstairs a great environment to eat relax chat or check the internet free wifi never had a bad meal and the helpings are such that the combo salads are good to share for a light lunch 100<u+00a5> after weeks in shanghai dining on local foods green  safe offers the salads you miss if you are from europeusa

accessible by cab or by line 1 metro to changshu road or hengshan road with 1015 minute easy walk hengshan metro is easier as the road is tree lined and an easy shady walk on a hot day cab will probably drop you outside the shanghai brewery another good eating spot so you have to walk down east dongping for a few minutes, at first you mark your choice of good food on the menu go to the cashier and afterwards get your food served we like to go here on a regular basis especially for breakfast check your bill right after order we already got dishes which are not even close to what was ordered, their salads i can highly recommend to anyone they have this salad combo offer which consists of 3 selection of different kind based on your liking a bit crowded tho oh and they have this supermarket and many takeaway foods too worth visiting, this casual and orderatthecounter place boasts of fresh and safe food free from chemicals its mixed used space with a restaurant grocery deli wine store and bakeshop all under 1 roof always busy during lunch and youll know why try the salads you can see them at the counter and they taste great

try their seasonal tart we had the yummy blueberry tart

weve also tried their pizzas mac and cheese and their thai curry with rice fresh fruit smoothies all of them taste great well definitely be back, the place is quite special in a good way though at the entrance there is a little supermarket with fresh fruits vegetables etc there are two floors with lots tables and seats each floor has an open kitchen

the menu offers a lot of different consumables and beverages on the paper menu you cross what you want and you go up to the cashier to pay for your order youll get a number which will make sure you will get your food served by the waiter the waiters are really friendly and quick most of them also speak on a fine level of english

for 88rmb you can pick 3 different salads there are many types of salads i tried the potato with bacon salmon and beetroots very tasty and fresh, yesterday was the second time that i went to green  safe the menu and interior decoration have changed a year ago the menu had more brunch items and the new menu has more regular meals with an asian flare i ordered the club sandwich the taste was good and it looked pretty though i prefer the more traditional and not so fancy club sandwich for the side dish the club sandwich doesnt come with a side dish i ordered the truffle mashed potato and it was very flavourful

there are two floors and the upstairs seating area is nicer looking and cozier the downstairs seating area looks more like a food court and it was very hot on a day of 30c the restaurant is not very stroller friendly as there is not much space between the tables and no elevator to the second floor the restaurant doesnt take reservation, nice place good food looks pretty western their salad menu set is convinient i would rexommend it bit busy during lunch tho, as a vegetarian i was very excited to have found this place in shanghai the concept store looks amazing and surprisingly the restaurant is quite good my wife had a pizza and it looks appetizing and was apparently very tasty
it is a pleasant discover and i definitely recommend it for healthy lover, the produce here are mostly self farmed and are thus taste good dishes are also well prepared and price is reasonable ambience is also very good its a great regular meal place, this is a us inspired supposedly organic cafe in shanghai it has a nice general ambience but the ordering system is totally crazy you line up and fill a sheet on which you select your food  drinks then you pay and get a number sit at a table and wait  and waitthen wait some more until your order appears piece by piecein random order
then price quality ratio is soso given that prices are rather on the higher scale but portions are small and mostly made up of cheap stuffings  leaves rice or pasta depending on the food selected

a recent visit was the most absurd we were there in the evening for glasses of wine and tried their 2nd floor we found a table and i was put in charge of placing our order and dutifully filled the lap and went to stand in queue only 1 cashier so despite having only 5 persons in front of me it took 10 min to get to order ordering was entertaining as the cashier tries to find the order on the lap confirm it double confirm punch it in scream it on the walkietalkie system and issue us coupons for wine glasses then they were out of changes and after 5 more minutes of crazy walkietalkie we agreed by mutual consent that once they got the change they could deliver it to our table i then proceeded to the bar at the other end of the room to collect our glasses of wine but this bar was obviously unmanned for service despite 2 staff standing there i asked for wine but got the reply  no wine here interesting concept for my nice paper coupons bewildered i manage to find on waiter roaming around who directed me to a  wine table which looked like a self serviceok but no strictly verboten to serve yourselves so after 23 min and so attention grabbing a young chap appeared and studied my coupons meticulously  i guess to make sure they were no forgery then i chose the wines we had ordered  you see despite having filled the ordering sheet with great details already about the wines types and sorts the coupons were only of generic nature showing a price category entitlement for each glass so you need to reorder again then the young lad start pouring both white and red wines into same glasses for both i guess no big deal but there are normally red wine glasses sparkling wine flutes and small white wine glasses it just a certain sense of lair i guess the pouring is laboriously as the young sommelier needs to pour each glass besides a  reference glass filled  of some murky water  dish water to make sure he doesnt pour above the 120 ml mark or what have you i could then proceed back to our table and my party 20 min had elapsed and my friends were relieved that i hadnt been abducted
then came the time to order a second round no lets go somewhere else

so as a customer you do all the work stand in line for very long and at various station and wit wait wait until the whole process has totally wore you down and prices and there to remind you that you paid for the  experience, the food was very good i got the thai chicken curry and a pumpkin soup taste was great and very fresh

unfortunately the service was very poor as i received my drinks after i finished eating, good place just so many people and food is good
need to try the 3 salads combination one will be enough for a person meal, great location in the old french concession near the corner with the shanghai brewery

deli shop on the first bar on second food order counters and seating on both communal style seating nicely decorated

good selection of wines by the glass and bottle as well as craft beers from around the world reasonably priced food good selection and taste

salads and breads are good porcini and truffle oil pizza great

weekends this place is packed like a zoo people pushing for seats on the shared tables seems under staffed as food delivery quite slow and never anyone at the beverage collection area the staff there are quite friendly and do there best ordering collection process could be improved still understanding this is part of the market concept

we would return for a low key lunch with friends not the place for a quiet intimate meal, love the selection of salads here my favorite option is their 3 salad combo where you can pick 3 salad combination for 88rmb perfect to share with a friend my favorite is thai beef salad and the pesto pasta salad but everything else is amazing their pasta is also fantastic its not just a restaurant you can buy fresh produce and other products here, nice for a break very good coffee and cake which took quite a while to bring out the grocery store is pleasant but very small although i highly recommend the marzipan and pumpkin seed chocolate didnt try the cafe upstairs but it was very popular, good quality and selection of food and libations the thin crust pizza was flavourful with good vegetarian options the fullsize salad is big for sharing the meat is from australia  beef and lamb upstairs theres a little pub corner and a full kitchen downstairs you can do produce grocery shopping pastry and grab a quick bite to eat a good weekend brunch place go early it gets busy, well at first it appears like a madness of french and chinese style and culture and then after you sit and eat awhile watching everyone doing their thing it turns into a lighter madness of chinese affected frencharama drama
the ordering at the bars is good but you need to be organised and the tables are very busy around midday on saturday
definitely for the more trendy and affluent young chinese families and couples upstairs you can be less family conscious
a very nice deli downstairs with very nice prices
food was very good, this is a local restuarant for me and it serves a wide range of salads with which you can add fish and meat dishes there is a wide selection for everybodys tastes they also have a shop selling cakes best carrot cake in town bread vegetables and frozen good quality meat and fish it can get very busy and you are not able to reserve a table you order at the counter and then the food is bought to you it is a quality hangout and i feel safe with the food, lot of variety in the food selection here good quality and decent portions great for sharing too selection of hot dishes changed regularly lot of salads juices shop attached, absolutely love green  safe this place is huge which means there are plenty of space its perfect for breakfast brunch afternoon coffee and even dinner the food is slightly pricey but you really get what you pay for fresh and healthy
upstairs area has huge windows which is nice to sit by on a sunny day and hangoutcatch up with friends, went for breakfast was very good and a lot of it too much upstairs it is great great to do work excellent beer collection as well, they have a new refurbished restaurant upstairs which is much more crowded with mainly all tables sharing with others
you cant order at the table and the food has really dropped in quality
eggs beneficts arrived cold with overcooked eggs and no sauce 
wont be coming again a lot more better options elsewhere, super cool experience with non traditional shanghai good options  very western in nature no frills dining but very quality food mid tier pricing for dinner and had lots of people seated cool date spot too as has a cute wine bar  beer bar area to the side u can enjoy as well very hipster vibe, we had lunch in this very nice and healthyorganic food restaurant the food was very good and the juices pink berry juice very good location of this restaurant in the french concession is very nice in the gubei area you also have this restaurant in the yakashima department store

you choose your food from a list and pay at the cashier desk the food is brought to your table


a bit pricy though, we were in search of fresh veggies and some healthy food and this hit the spot on both counts if youre in search of a late bite and anytime after 9ish is cutting it fine in shanghai you may find  like we did  that most of the salads are already sold out and with the downstairs kitchen closing early some of the sections on the menu arent available that said we had japanese baked pumpkin with herbs delicious a ribeye steak fab quality and an indulgent truffle and mushroom pizza which came with a little soft quails egg on each slicereally delicious our waiter was also very helpful especially as 75 of all dishes were already sold out or not available, i am american and do not like traditional cantonese food at all green and safe was a welcomed break and also really nice to eat some fresh food and vegetables
i highly recommend although the order method is extremely confusing  i wish the would ditch the stupid clip boards and just have everyone order at the register, we went there for brunch today but the second floor was under renovation the first floor was crowded with mostly chinese i have to say that this place is overrated  pasta is not al dente with lots of oil my friends order was late 20 mins beet root salad was messily presented one service staff refused to serve us claiming that she is off work and replied us in poor manner many local staff i talked to had this i dont care attitude perhaps except the managerowner given the price tag i would expect better food and service, great place for vegetarian and vegan food that is interesting in texture and flavor beautiful plates, a bit pricey for what it is but it definitely delivers on food in a comfortable restaurant and casual neighborhood, go for coffee breakfast lunchshop there for dinner
this cafe is a favourite for my friends and i 
silly old name i think but expats are obsessed with food safety, as recommended by a chinese friend this place has got me hooked ive only been in shanghai for five days but been here four times delicious food  really so fresh so wholesome so good, the brunch place to be a bit croded in peaks  but thats the gold medall for a place here in shanghai the restaurant head service is fantastic i think its peter always around with smile and professionalism he remember ones own food preferences and is out and about in efficiency my tip try to get a window table  the sun coverage on those tables is just right on a sunday noon to brighten up your day, love the selections of organic salad here its a nice place to have casual dining or brunch with family and friend very cozy environment with friendly service you may do grocery shopping here too","Turkish cuisine",0.999853560990794
54,"excellent indian food very casual very busy popular we had 8 people and they didnt want us to save a table one hard thing about this place, food quality and quantity is good but taste is not much better options available in shanghai for indian food like vedas restaurant have 2 branches in shanghai, excellent sense of services  food is very delicious you never realize that you are eating in shanghai it will feel like you are in punjabi dhada delhi hotel owner and workers are very friendly i stayed in holliday inn, this would have been my 10th visit to the restaurant and the service  quality is never compromised this time we ordered variety of rotis jalfrizi samosa and dal the quality was good as before the time taken to order serve reorder and bill issue everything is on time love to visit multiple them again the photo is of onion pakora ordered during yesterdays visit must try, shanghai in general has impressed me for quality of indian food but bollywood takes it to another level the combination of ambience service and music is simply excellent there are sufficient vegetarian options to choose from and just the right variety of drinks in the bar
highly recommended, we were in shanghai for a few days and needed a curry

the restaurant has a great atmosphere and a good feel about it we ordered a variety of dishes veg and non veg the spices were excellent and quality was good we was genuinely surprised and pleased

we will be heading back on our return without a doubt

i would highly recommend it , i really appreciate for the good taste of food specially for veterinarians and continental food lovers, this is theme restaurant inside you can find always playing on screents indian movies or music on the walls portraits of famous indian actors

food is very good quality indian food and of course very spicy, its a nice restaurant with bollywood theme owner is from goayou can enjoy bollywood songs on big screen food is good they give you schezwan chutney on request must visit, went for a late dinner with a friend ordered deal carry nan butter and garlic and tanduri chicken 
atmosphere is good we even watched cricket game  like in a real indian restaurant 
the food was good the tanduri was dry and disappoints but exapt of that was great will return to eat there the didnt have ipa beer which its a crime not to have one in indian restaurant, had some guests from india so went here i liked it they liked it  price was very good for shanghai service very good indeed relaxed place and comfortable busy restaurant, good location  pleasantly surprised tasted good  authentic ingredients  had aloo gobi and dahl with tandoori roti hit the spot first indian meal after 2 weeks may go there today <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008b>, for two consecutive years i have taken two different student groups here four total for the set lunch after studying indian literature students who love indian food and those who never ate indian food before were equally pleased with the meal the restaurant owners gave us a separate room upstairs complete with a screen featuring bollywood movie excerpts and then provided a dancer who got the kids on their feet dancing after enjoying the meal which included delicious garlic nan that was unending students also loved the mango lassi when dining here alone i always order the chicken korma my favorite yum, good value meal for lunch set in this area
i have visited here several times with friends and not super good but not disappointing either, excellent is the word
in china but feel as if in india the deco the music indian and bollywood feel food was just amazing served by very friendly staff will definitely visit again the restaurant owner kk has created a homely touch in the restaurant, i you are craving for indian food then this place is good choice for people living in new pudong area of shanghai i order food from this restaurant and get it delivered to my hotel room food is ok its like any order restaurant in india problem is there is a delivery charge equals to taxi fare round trip to your place so its better to visit this place my your self and have food there only, its a budget restuarant and amazing quick service you may not get all the variety of indian food but decent enough, decent indian food but we love our usual indian restaurant back home in singapore 10x better  tandoori corner ok service though rather pushy to order more the music was too loud perhaps to give ambience of a bar to attract expat bargoers in this expat area for us as we go back singapore once a month on average though the place is nearby we will perhaps hold off our indian food craving until we are back home , excellent menu real indian taste try chicken biryani  chicken tikka its just awesome must try at once, i usually travel every month to shanghai with my colleaguesthe food quality and quantity is amazingstaff is fantastic and make you feel at homemr kuldeep the owner of bollywood is always present in the restaurant and will wish each n everyone entering or leaving personally which is a sign of great hospitalityi love to go and spend few hours sitting and chitchatting over great food light music and amazing pictures of all bollywood stars
keep it up bollywood we all love you wish in future every corner of china has a bollywood own by you
from etihad airways family n mamta sachdeva, i was in shanghai for 3 days and everyday i visited the restaurant
restaurant has bollywood theme with pictures of hindi film stars all around and they were playing nice hindi music
tried lunch and dinnerthey have lunch special something like a set thalli very reasonably priced and good
dinner was a la carte good choice on the menu food and service was great
would definitely visit on next visit to shanghai, was taken by friends who lives in green city area suburb expat area around 15 km of downtown the food was nice the service is attentive the indian music sometimes is too noisy but fine all in if you are in area you could give a shot otherwise it is really too far away from downtown  not for travelers but neighborhood people, the hotel walls are decorated with photos of bollywood actor and actresses indian bollywood music keeps on playing i liked the hotel decoration and music the food served was tasty it met the indian taste good location and tasty food which makes it a good restaurant, the location is a little bit far from subway but all the efforts to get there were valid because its a remarkable place to eat authentic indian food the butter chicken is to die for the paneer pakoda and samosas also are very tasty the environment is relatively simple but big and inviting and as the name says a lot of bollywood posters on the wall and video clips all the waiters were very kind and attentive and even helped me to take taxi back to subway
i packed a lot of food to eat home and i can say that for sure i will return to this amazing restaurant, 1 taste loved it well cooked great flavor
2 time took 25 minutes to get garlic yogurt chicken was a bit silly when there was only 5 other people total in the place at 2pm in the da and they all already had their main meals
3 waiter service sat around after meal was finished waiting for the server a patient 10 minuted but he never came back so i had to get up and track him down to pay my bill
4 seating location you can sit inside or outside i sat outside to enjoy the breeze and that was golden blessing on the hot day in september i did walk inside to check the temperature and it was less cool inside than outside due to the breeze
5 location of this place the location of this place is not centrally located so you will need to expect to travel over to it unless you are staying in one of the near by hotels on business
6 price i liked the prices compared to other nearby westerner type places the prices where more on target for the location i had two cokes a main course and prata that totalled 145rmb i missed breakfast and could not finish the last couple of bite of the prata
7 atmosphere enjoyable again i sat outside so got to see traffic and people walking past with the ever present honks of cars as they move carefree about disregarding on coming traffics turning

this gets a 3 from me because its all in all is not a 5, revisited the bollywood after a long gap  redecoration on wall  i feel happy when my chinese friends say  excellent butter chicken and nan  can we have one more   i feel home to have masala tea after lunch, even though the location is a bit far from the city center it was truly worth it we ordered some food such as the butter chicken vegetable curry and we also tried the 5 bread combination in a basket which was huge i personally recommend the mango lassi for the drink as it is their specialty drink the owner kk was super friendly and the staffs were really helpful and kind will definitely come back, there is a very good service the food is just delicious i go there every time i visit my parents if you love indian food go there, had a group dinner in here about 8 of us from a variety of countries we ate fairly early around 6pm and were the only diners at this time no booking was needed the staff were friendly and attentive
food was excellent mutton dopiazas and bhuna all fantastic the chat for a starter was the best i have had butter naans were divine
one person in our group was not thrilled with their chilli chicken but everyone else enjoyed their meal
total was approx $220 for 8 people although most folks were not drinking, ever since the opening of this restaurant ive been a regular visitor there with exceptionally authentic finger licking indian food coupled with great service its not surprising that in just 6 years of its existence bollywood has gained the status of best indian restaurant in shanghai and one of the top 50 restaurants among more than 15000 different restaurants in shanghai

over last few years during my visits i have witnessed many small yet important gestures like bringing cakes for the guests on their special occasions playing birthday songs offering complimentary drinks or deserts letting children play around serving free food for charity etc etc with a very humble approach by the owner kk

i really appreciate and share my best wishes for an even greater success to entire bollywood team like many other guests from india china america france russia japan south africa and many others, not good the food good but when see second floor and third floor is dirty and the cooking place very dirty not clean i also heard a snore when i wandered into the restaurant and found someone asleep in the restaurant my advice look for another restaurant not good, really enjoy going here especially with friends from abroad truly authentic food even my colleagues from delhi frequent bollywood when they are in town food is terrific atmosphere is interesting and fun with evening dance performance my opinion best indian food in jinqiao been living here 3 years also 12 block from
marriott pudong east so easy to get to try it, visited this restaurant on a sunday for dinner little expensive compared to other indian restaurants but the taste and quality of the food is good more than that you can enjoy wonderful indian music along with bhangra dance, bollywood is one of our favorite dining places the food is excellent the staff is very attentive you can dine in or carry out when you order directly from bollywood they free delivery in jinqiao, a complete authentic indian restaurant in shanghai with special welcome music dance and a very caring nature in indian style provides all types of indian flavors in vegetarian non vegetarian food along with special flavors which takes care of requirements of chinese customers as well

really appreciable kuldeep ji and thankful as well to provide indian flavors in shanghai, i go to bollywood quite a bit for lunch their lunch set are quick reasonable and filling i recommend it ambience is nice and music is nostalgic, just leave proper authentic indian food available at the restaurant which is rare in shanghai aside you will find only few restaurants in india even living upto this level
i have visited some of such restaurants but this one is special for being regularly updated and more particularly finely maintained
one needs pure passion to have created a place like this hats off to kk the owner who is always there to welcome you

a must visit attraction for india tourist trust me you will just love the ambiance here, went for the 1st time during by business trip to shanghai conveniently located in the vicinity of good hotels it offers a wide variety of authentic north indian stuff the decor is befitting tribute to bollywood at large

after moving to shanghai have introduced indian food to many chinese colleagues at bollywood at lunch time perfect setting for quick lunch with variety of dishes for a compelling value

all in all very happy with food decor and service

rajiv, hi all  been to bollywood indian restaurant last month  the place is nice but space is little small  food is excellent  staff need to be more professional , one of best restaurant for indian food in shanghai it is thematic restaurant with full of bollywood pics all the best to k k sharma who runs this restaurant, not the best indian food ive ever had but not the worst lunch sets are predictably quick and good bargains pretty bland and not as wonderfully spicey as ive had in other indian restaurants, very nice food and awesome staff and crew i would definitely come back we were first people to get into this door for brunch around 10am staff people showed great attitude and customer touch to help us to get as much dishes possible when we are in time crunch they even helped us to get the taxi to pvg airport great experience, the best indian food restaurant ive come across in shanghai bhuna mutton and dal makhni to die for
a very warm and hospitable ambience
do meet the owner kk whos always there to make you feel extra special
cheers, so we went for a business trip to china and as we indians crave for indian food we found this restaurant with good reviews on ta went ahead of our flight to just calm down our cravings for a day
the first thing you will notice is the interiors with pictures of bollywood celebrities and then the good tasty food
the restaurant is quite close to the pudong airport so access is not that difficult, we went on business meetings for at least 3 times in a week and ever time it was better than before keep it up

cannot expect better than this in shanghai, if you are looking to experience great indian food and service this is a one of the best places in shanghai

i have experienced bollywood several times with family friends and colleagues bollywood offers a moreish factor a must visit indian in shanghai, bollywood indian restaurant is the most authentic indian restaurant in shanghai it provides wide range of real indian food and drinks including old monk  bollywood also organize indian festival parties such as holi diwali i would definitely recommend bollywood if you stay in shanghai or a traveller here

note do meet the owner kk for some extra fun and laughter , loved the theme feel like in mumbai the food was awesome tandoori naan butter roti chicken tikka just amazing not to miss the rice kheer thank you for the great staff and a bow to the owner who managed to set up a restaurant where getting indian food is kinda difficult, bollywood restaurant offers a variety of delicious indian dishes streaming of popular bollywood films and a homelike welcoming atmosphere the owner will make sure you are enjoying the food and having the time of your life out of the favorites would be tandoori naan and mangolassialso you can experience in the restaurant true indian celebrations with a lot of energy laughter color and neverending buffet of indian dishes like diwali so keep a hand on pulse, bollywood completely impressed me amongst other international restaurants bollywood strikes me as a place with great personality the food is authentic and the staff is most friendly i have been a few times and sometimes they have life dance performances 1010 for me","Spanish cuisine",0.964719990470402
55,"great family place my kids love to come for brunch and have a lot of churros at the end of the meal we love this place, a hidden place you need to know where to go to find it nice interiors with fun art on the walls a touch of posh but still very relaxed atmosphere really good fresh mexican food and good wines a mix of chinese and nonchinese guests ok prices but not cheap, one of my best service experiences in shanghai the food was very tasty and the staff took care about any dietary requirements vegetarian gluten free etc also they handled a bigger group 20 people well without any complaints if you are vegetarian you cannot choose out of many options but those they offer are tasty
also the set prize for a brunch was ok around 160rmb for four courses guacemole quesadillas main course and dessert incl one drink for the vegetarian option even a bit less 135
definitely a place to visit again, rw visited maya for the first time on occasion of the restaurant week food was very good and service very correct enjoyed the spinachcheese empanadas probably more than the red kingfish aguachile a bit tastier and more elaborated on the main courses they were good and the portions quite generous but not wowing such a sensation was for a chickenmango taco that was ordered off rw menu definitely the best choice of the evening besides the tequila sour
if had to put a negative note this would be on the music choice honestly for such a restaurant i was not expecting to accompany my dishes with commercial bachata and reggaeton that should be left for other mexicanthemed party places and there are a few in shanghai i sincerely hope they could put more attention into the music list in order to round well the whole experience
the desserts were the best ending for the meal especially the chocolate lava cake tasty and almost imperceptibly spicy but a great enhancer for the taste
will definitely have to come back again to try more dishes out of rw, this restrobar offers a variety of food to all the key thing is the hospitality and the services youll get here from outside nobody would know there is such a nice restrobar in that area but once youre in you would love to visit again and thats what we did , ate here with friends who live in shanghai and enjoyed the food wasnt sure what to expect bc im native to ca and know my mexican food we had a bunch of different appetizers tacos ceviche guacamole shrimp fajitas and garlic jalapeno quesadillas
chef was very accommodating to my friends dairy issues and took out butter and cheese but all food still had nice flavor
ceviche is served more like sushi i dont think the quesadillas had any cheese but were all jalapeno flour tortillas with fajitas were really good and fresh
maya is trying to be a hgherend mexican restaurant when sometimes we just want good food without the pompandcircumstance id say try maya if you need to scratch the itch for mexican food lovely location in apartment building area hard to find if you arent with someone who knows the area or location

drinks good size and there is a buy one get one happy hour
staff very friendly and attentive, i have visited this restaurant quite a few times and overall i have had good experiences i am always looking for options in variety of food in china so mexican is a very refreshing change
food  drinks are good selection and ambiance is relaxing and tasteful i have always had good service as well only downside is you need to know where you are going since it is located inside a housing gated community so it is awkward if you have never been there before and finding a cab later can be a hassle but we have been lucky most times, food was bland i never add salt or pepper to my meals but this place needed it

terrible a service i wont be going back, ive been here many times but only for brunch i cant resist an all you can drink brunch especially when the drinks are good and the food follows suit i definitely regret it later that night but at the time its bliss, they live in shanghai and we live in sai gon we have worked together in israel and saudi arabia we have known each other for 20 years and we have shared many meals together since shanghai is their city it was their choice we decided to eat early about 530 when we arrived we were the only customers there after 6 it began to fill up service was friendly and attentive without being obtrusive the menus are attractive and very helpfully designed rather than ordering a full main meal each we decided to order a variety of appetizers and side dishes to try to appreciate the range of tastes and ingredients on offer all were delicious and we were all very satisfied including our friends 20 year old sun being used to mexican restaurants in california i am used to being offered complimentary chips and house salsa not here i think they could offer a little something to whet the appetitive as you peruse the menu all in all a very enjoyable experience, we felt very well looked after at this restaurant there was not a moment when we tried to get attention from the waiting staff the food was equally of a high standard and beautifully presented a good variety of dishes to suit all tastes and food intollerences they adapted a dish to suit my needs with no hesitation
it was clear a real effort was made to make our dining experience special  which it certainly was  thank you highly recommend, im from southern california so ive had a lot of really authentic mexican food
pretty good tacos guacamole and enchiladas here the ceviche was not great
this place probably has the best mexican food in shanghai but doesnt come close to the quality found in socal
oh and the location is in an apartment building so its a bit off the main road, i went other some friends for a wine tasting experience with a set menu
the bar area is ok but after living in dubai for years i find these kind of places very cold sterilized lacking in soul
the food was good nothing unforgettable but good chef explained us his dishes and overall it was a pleasant experience recommended as long as you are the kind of person who doesnt check the bill when it finally hits the table, had a great night with a group of 20 friends so it was a big table but service was good and food amazing, i visited this restaurant for dinner with my husband  his brothers a very nice uniquely decorated restaurant its located upstairs which i think its not really convenient its a small chic restaurant that serves mexican food we each had a margarita to start of with and enjoyed it very much had a nice menu with also some vegetarian options portions was rather big  the prices were rather expensive too there was a nice display of alcohol bottles displayed which was very attractive i had a dish made of aubergine which was very good the manager was also nice and was busy entertaining  chatting with customers, really good food been going there for a few years now every time i visit shanghai the quesadillas are fantastic service is excellent  a very well run establishment, have been in this place for few times and always had a great experience first of all the service one of the best service level ive experienced in shanghai the quality of food in s always great highly recommend the tuna steak the shredded chicken for main course actually from the ceviche starters all the way to the sample platter for desert all was so good bottom line one of the best places in shanghai no doubt they are here for so long, i have previously reviewed this restaurant before and could not say enough about the service and especially the food the previous experience was excellent this experience was average to low service was iffy at times having to get up and get someone food was delivered late and arrived cold upon inquiring about why fajita meat immediately served was cold someone in management asked us if it had been sitting on the table a long time rather than argue a point that did not merit a response we left this was a sad experience at a restaurant that has previously been an enjoyable highlight on each visit, brilliant service excellent food affordable wine and genuine atmosphere thats a winning formula welcome to maya enjoy, very nice restaurant wonderful food however it is somehow expensive compared to similar restaurants but worth a try, definitely one of our favorite restaurant in shanghai everything they prepare is good be it mexican food or fusion food another good point is that they will recognize you and youll feel more and more at home, we were there with the family the location is a bit strange and the traffic quite heavy the staff was very friendly and the decor nice we found the food average, decent mexican food in a cozy atmosphere the selection in the menu is fine we had many appetizers the decoration is trying to be mexican but just seems like any usual restaurant nothing special, if you are looking for mexican something spicy tequila based drinks maya is one the best mexican i have visited in shanghai the service is good and the staff is fairly flexible to make small adjustments to the dishes, my wife and i had a good meal here it was rather expensive for the city when compared to what you could get for the same money elsewhere but not extortionate by any means all western style food can be a bit more expensive here than asian cuisine flavours were good and well balanced a lot of fresh citrus flavours meant the sometimes heavy nature of mexican cuisine was expertly avoided though that was probably due to my wifes ordering skills nice decor and very attentive staff  plates disappeared as the last mouthful was lifted off almost disconcertingly so, good portion sizes but a bit too salty for me huge range of food to choose from and the environment is very nice dimly lit well spaced doesnt feel like shanghai a nice escape price wise this is quite expensive for what it is but you are paying not for the food but for the experience itself around 300400rmb or<u+00a3>3040 head not including drinks, went there with my brother who lives in shanghai  its off the beaten path in an apartment complex but has been around for years it was packed on a monday night we started with the fresh guacamole and salsa plus margaritas everything tasted authentic and delicious my husband tried 3 different tacos and couldnt decide which was best since he liked all of them the shredded chicken enchilada was perfectly spiced and you get a choice of sauce which helps customize the heatmildhot or mole they have a molten chocolate cake that was to die for
would definitely go back next time we visit shanghai, im always looking for a spot with good veggie options and i love mexican this place had good food great service and phenomenal margaritas, a group of us like to brunch in shanghai and especially when there is free flow which for those of you who dont know means all you care to drink for a set price there are flavored margaritas or sangria i got the sangria and did glasses of both the red or white the white is better and lighter there were lots of options for brunch food the eggs were excellent everyones food was good, went for sunday brunch a bit weird to have to walk into a compound to find the place but it was worth it the decor is really well done and tables are set for a proper meal not a snack i appreciated the cloth napkins rather than paper serviettes everything from the service to atmosphere and drinks was pleasant i was especially pleased i had chosen the tamarind sour drink  try one and you will agree its delish, i visited maya for saturday brunch based on reviews and i was not disappointed i ordered chips and guacamole to start i have to mention that i live in china and it is very difficult to find avocados let alone killer guaci was in heaven my main dish was the breakfast burrito and it was really delicious
my friend and i ordered the bottomless margaritas and had three each of the frozen strawberry they were decent but not sure how much alcohol was in them normally three margaritas would have me feeling way bettermaybe it was the quality of the tequila regardless they were tasty
the ambiance was nice and the music was fun it was a nice change of scenery and i will definitely go back when i am in the city i bet it is a great spot for dinner, nice place and food was very good and freash ingredient sauce for meat nice and tasty sure i will came back, delicious food wonderful ambience prompt service and superb drinks and coffee would definitely visit again, i got there with no that high expectations thinking in a mexican restaurant in shanghai where from i came monterrey there are really good cousine and i was totally surprised
enviroment is nice service is ok but the food taste really good with many differences to the original mexican food but it is really good
what i liked the most were the tortillas these are actually better that many mexican ones
i will definitely go back to this nice restaurant, about 10 of us went for brunch and it was fantastic the eggs benedict was possibly the best i have ever had others opted for more of a mexican theme and everyone came away satisfied the service was efficient without being bothersome it is a larger restaurant but despite its size it has a great atmosphere, one of the best mexican restaurant in shanghai nice atmosphere good food and service many good cocktails and mexican beers, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and it sets the tone for a mexican dining experience we were surprised to be able to experience such authentic mexican food in shanghai china there are lots and lots of westerners who come to this restaurant and it helps provide you with a bit of familiarity if you are in need of this the chicken fajitas were lovely and the dish contained the freshest ingredients the habanero salsa was also amazingvery very spicy it had a real kick to it there is nothing that i could be critical of not even in the slightest sense it was so filling and it was just like going to a mexican restaurant back at home in the us the prices are however western prices but the quality is in line with the price and if you are like us and not sure if you can trust the meat in china then youll be eager to come here and have a great meal where you can rest assured trust the quality of the food and enjoy a wonderful meal with wonderfully prepared dishes up to the western standard we will definitely be going back, i am mexican and the food was beyond good the food is really amazing some of the dishes even taste like my moms the prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is amazing the place is romantic quite and the staff is really nice and friendly i can definetely say that now on is my favourite restaurant in china it is a bit hidden but once you find the entrance and go to the second floor of the building is amazing a most in china definetely a good place, spent 6 hours on this restaurant together with 35 friends in a private room with 7 course meal and free flow of beverages and champagne to welcome the new year very good food and fantastic service from english speaking personnel we had a set menu so i did not have the time to test their menu but if its only half as good as our set menu it would be more than satisfying very good value for money thank you grace for excellent service, this is a gem hidden in an apartment complex hence a bit difficult to find the restaurant has a large area with different sections food menu is not elaborate but whatever they have is delicious creative options in cocktails for ladies i tried margarita and sangria and both were prepared well, maya is one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai the food and presentation are always top notch quality dinner can be pricey but their brunch menu on saturdays and sundays is affordable and just as good i highly recommend the passion fruit margarita, this is a mexican restaurant tucked away on the 1st floor of a club house nice decor mixture of ex pats and locals enjoyed very much our brunch we both had eggsmine scrambled hubbies fried i had refried beans and a spicy salsa with mine he had meat of some description both served on corn tortillas i had a margarita and he had a corona bottomless offer was tempting but didnt have all day then complimentary donuts churros with hot chocolate sauce and honey and cinnamon price was fine and portion size was very satisfying, though the place is a bit interior it offers a good range of mexican drinks and food we enjoyed tequila and mexican food, incredible experience from my way in with a warm welcome to my way out beautiful restaurant and great service i ordered different appetizers because i wanted to try as many things as possible had also a sangria and for dessert churros id go back in a heartbeat, this wonderful little gem is tucked away within an upscale apartment complex the restaurant had a cozy and warm atmosphere along with an attentive staff we have been traveling in china for three weeks and was very grateful to have found this yummy mexican restaurant the food was very delicious excellent quality and prepared perfectly we had tried several menu items and was pleased with all the choices we added a few cold mexican beers and it was a fiesta an unexpected dining experience in china we love it, we had a large group 10 adults and 4 kids we were there for brunch which includes bottomless sangria or margaritas the staff was very attentive handled our loud group which only got louder with alcohol the food was delicious limited menu that you select from and a few courses are family style this is a hidden gem well worth looking for and dining at, off the beaten path and hidden in a residential complex this is a gem salsa top notch for china food was delicious in a non traditional mexican way service was excellent we went early and hit a happy hour 2 for 1 which is always a good thing
try it if you are tired of chinese food the atmosphere is peaceful and you will be happy you dined there, i went with friends we book a table before every time we go there the food is really really good traditional mexican food even my mexican friends like it
service is good the little girl always stand around watching what we need and serving food
some people may find it hard to find the location yes if not introduced by friend it is too hard to be find out
compered with normal western restaurant we go in shopping mall maya may cost you more than you thought i say at least 300rmb per person normally, mexican food i was introduced to in california is very filling dishes like burrito this is tasty mexicanperuvian food served in smaller portions i like their chorizo quesaidilla calamari argentinian beef with green chili is our favorite my wife loves their churros, atmosphere is warm and friendly casual but comfortable the food is served very quickly the chips dips and sauce are quite tasty you will find all the usual mexican dishes good food and great place for gathering","sport bar",0.999786192727329
56,"it used to be my canteen when i was living in shanghai although havent been here for long their services and cuisine were pretty nice still it used to have many customers flooded and we usually enjoyed their pizza or antipasti served before getting a table in feb during cny we were luckily  was easily to grab a table i was amazed by its charge and the food quality its economy and cool as before we ordered authentic dishes love them all and i particularly appreciate their tiramisu  while the lamb chop may not be our choice but nice still
no matter whatthis will still be one of my favorite dinning place in shanghai, i have been going to this restaurant about 10 times in the last 5 years service is getting worse each time i accept many diners or noisy groups but i cant tolerate rude staff
food is ok but not to the same level as other italian restaurants in shanghai, no spanish wine available ive order a glass of wine but they show me the bottle of wine ordered so i just need to trust wine was the one chosen food was ok, a very warm  friendly and cosy place i feel like home i have my dinners or celecbrations very often food very good quality and always fresh
the price of a meal can be expenssive regarding what you order but this is everywhere
i could recommend a lot of different dishes but it worth to try to find by yourself
employees from damarco are very friendly and try to make you feel relaxed and calm
i suggest to people to try, where i should start the venue feels like home cosy atmosphere good for large group of friends families or couples food is beyond amazing you have things are so typical italian but also topical argentine cuisine like vitel tone free flow of bread which for a italian restaurant is important portions are just great and big dishes to recommend are the lasagna raviolis and gnocchi desserts i always order crema catalana for wine lovers you have the house wine which is affordable and if not soft drinks and other spirits super recommend this place, i suspect this place is hitormiss depending on what is selected from the menu the soup is uninspiring and bland the lasagna is decent but not mouthwatering bread is dry and bland house chianti is absolutely horrible and they dont offer many wines by the glass service was ok but not attentive

i was definitely expecting more based on the reviews but left somewhat disappointed, best italian restaurant in shangai really and im italian i know what im talking about
its not cheap but you can pay more for worse places, i happened upon da marco while searching for an italian restaurant in shanghai and thought i would take a chance it was a hunch that paid off the whole experience was incredible from start to finish the food was so fresh and prepared to perfection our waiter was such a good laugh and he made the evening even better will certainly be going back on my next trip to shanghai, the chef walked in and introduced himself offered to cook off the menu nice atmosphere 10 of us  enjoyed, for living in town for years this restaurant is a sure value simple and classical italian food but really worth it for the price the welcoming of the guest with free slice of pizza + glass of proseco is really kindprofessional, we always come to da marco if we look for a nice italian food for reasonable prices pizza and pasta are very good and authentic location is not fancy but no issue if you are inside the restaurant i can fully recommend da marco for a casual family lunch or dinner, i have been a couple of times to this place and i have always been disappointed the place is old the menu hasnt changed for a years the food is always soggy and doesnt feel fresh i think with all the new italian places in town there is no reason to go da marco anymore, great foot and ambience<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0083> excellent pizzas<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080> perfect quality for your money the best in shanghai so far<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>, friends who lived in shanghai raved about this place da marcos has an extensive menu of traditional italian dishes the pizza and pastas were very popular with other diners but because my husband and i are gluten free we selected two wonderful risottos my mushroom risotto was huge and brimming with many types of delicious mushrooms his seafood risotto was heaped with scallops crab and mussels our appetizers caprese salad and arugula with fresh mozzarella were also substantial there was a very nice wine list with affordable wines by the glass or bottle it is an easy walk from the jiangsu road metro stop, excellent and highly recommended from a associate food was great and service too surprised at the variety of pasta pizza chicken and veal dishes to choose from great atmosphere for western customer entertainment, the place is hidden inside a building in a quite weird surrounding besides that the ambiance is comfortable and the upside is the italian authentic cuisine large portions of delicious pasta my favorites are the 4 cheese fettuccini carbonara or seafood tomato

price is very cheap for xangai standards it is a must for foodies, top ratio qualityprice in shanghai prepare yourself to reserve your table in advance it is very popular with all food  lovers no matter if you are chinese or foreigners food is italian high quality and original recipe style surely to return here, ive been there during lunch beef carpaccio was good but pastas and pizzas were ok mozzarella salads were dry prices are affordable,  da marco still is one of the most respected italian restaurants in town and there are many reasons why
probably one of the best value for money when it comes to italian cuisine in shanghai
while the menu is made of most of the classics when it comes to pizza and pasta chef max patron in the cuisine has been on fire for the past 34 years when he started to give an extremely creative twist to the offer with his very special daily specials have taken some pics last night
crowd is well balanced its home for many italians in town
i was one of the first clients back in 1999 and i have been going on a weekly basis ever since
great place to enjoy a good italian treat in a very friendly and relaxed environment
my favorites excluding specials penne mario pizza number 2 margherita + parma ham and beef tartare comes with black truffle when available, it is one of the oldest italian restaurant in town but still fully packed decent pizzas and service fair prices, food is good but too this appointed about stuff attitude after an exhausted working day i wanted to come here for a drink and some food cause it was about 10pm already and my home is close to the restaurant but chinese waiter girl with short hair pointed at the chair and said  kitchen is closing if drink sit there in chinese  <u+5750><u+90a3>� dont even understand why she was employed to work in this nice restaurant i took colleagues and friends came here many times but never meet this situation ad today i am very angry and disappointed in shanghai there are many good restaurants and services the owner should have known to keep business running just a kind comment from regular customers wont be here again, recently ate at this restaurant and upon entering it was quite full so we were glad we made reservations although for non smokers like myself it is not pleasant to have the entrance a bar area where all the smokers congregate the service was very very slow and it almost felt like we were being ignored and it took a good few times of trying to get a waiter to come over to take our order the food was ok nothing special there are better italian restaurants in shanghai and based on the poor level of service i do not see myself returning here again, we stayed many times in a hotel in a walking distance from pudong branch of this italian restaurant great wines for very reasonable price in comparison with other places in shanghai i recommend the lunch menu great value and tasty but even the evening menu is very reasonable  great taste for fair price, loved the atmosphere in the restaurant really gave you the rustic intimate italian style dining food was authentic and rich in both color and flavor service was on the spot with our annoying 16 tops group a special mention to the filipino staff that truly characterizes that familiar and comfortable service you expect in such an environment will definitely go back again, located in the heart of downtown shanghaieasy to get there from all directionsby all means of transport family run restaurant 2 levels for both smoking and nonsmoking quiet good for family or friends reunion and for business meeting as well personally i recommend all the dishes there, it is difficult to define a cooking as italian expecially from abroad the italian territory spread over more than one hundred of provences each with their peculiarity da marco was able to let the customer understand to be really at an italian table this is very important outcome for an italian restaurant abroad, excellent flavor and service for western people i loved the food is extraordinary and very kind service if you go to shanghai is the best choice for italian food, a really good italian restaurant in central shanghai genuine and with a very friendly staff
good variety of food great selection of starters and main courses rating from pastapizza to fine meat and fish
can truly recommend this place, do you like italian food so what are you waiting for at da marco you will get great food for the money in a nice environment

i have tried almost everything on the menu and have nothing to complain, good italian restaurant maybe not the best i had in town good choice of starters selected ingredients first dishes not really impressive meat much better rich wine selection, i have been to da marco several times since my first time in 2008 the restaurant is well known among italian expats last time i went for dinner with some friends and we ordered a starter pasta meats and pizzas all of them tasty and authentic italian the starter with assorted cold cuts was very good but portion not so big other dishes were enough
service was good and i noticed improved compared to the past but maybe because at that moment there were not so many customers in the restaruant
prices are reasonable considering other similar restaurants in shanghai
i appreciate they served still water for free while other restaruants usually force to order an expensive bottle of imported water, damarco is my favourite italian restaurant in shanghai since many years i eat with joy seafood baby chicken and sallads and of course pizza it feels like italy but still down town shanghai good for famililies wine is enjoyable and service is very good, authentic italian specialities made by the same chef for the last 15 years or so that should be the end of the review as no more needs to be said  if you add a vast and perfectly selected list of italian wines good service and very good value for money this is a place not to be missed always very busy with good vibes and very friendly staff once you enter the time stops and the fiesta begins enjoy, the food was just ok but service was worse we waiting a while for our drinks to come and then they brought my meal first and waited 10 minutes for my husbands meal to come i had to ask them what about my husbands dinner
we were not able to have a conversation because some jerk sitting next to us was talking on the phone very loud in italian and the tables were very close together my husband thought the pizza was pretty but my spaghetti vongole lacked taste but i cant say that it was bad and i was also displeased with the small amount of spaghetti, the food was very nice and authentic the pasta and the pizza were my favorites
the atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice and warm
would love to go back again, this place is great for italian food its very authentic at least from what im used to eating coming from the us

its located on the western edge of jingan territory on dongzhuanbang road between zhenning road and jiangsu road

the servings are large in portion speaking of which you must try the minestrone soup comes in a huge bowl with a recessed center area for even more soup if memory serves me correctly the mushroom soup was also spectacular

the pastas are wonderful as well

the environment was very italian but the restaurant entrance has a bar area where in the evenings there are lots of foreigners hanging around and smoking that smoking part is really the part i cant stand as a restaurant patron you have to cross through this smoking area before emerging unto the dining area

oh well , came here for lunch via the subway alighted jiangsu station exit 3 walked abt 20m and turned right into a small road which is about 75m long exit the small road and turned right walked 20m and met the complex where the restuarant is located

nice ambience and a very clean place not much of a crowd noted that there are locals and westerners diners its unfortunate that the complex itself is undergoing a facelift currently but the restuatant is still opened business as usual

waiter and waitress are polite and friendly noted that the waitress is chinese and the waiter is philippino

orders came pretty fast after 15 mins and the food are very well prepared

ordered a pizza with mozzarella and sausage carbonara spaghetti ministrone soup and the creamy tiramisu and a bottle of sparkling water

the food quality is definately great unlike other pizza joints the food is not overly salty

paid about 385rmb for the meal and left the place satisfied, the correct name for this restaurant should be da marco for the owner and chief chef marco an italian married a shanghai woman this is my favorite italian restaurant in shanghai i was there since they started business same place but in a smaller scale

its milanese home cooking there was a period of time we go almost 3 times a week feel like home kitchen they serve decent house wine with the best price in shanghai too

there are many new italian restaurants open in shanghai i will still vote this place as my favorite for their reasonable price good food and fine dinning atmosphere, really nice place and atmosphere its a bit noisy but any place is italy is noisy  service was decent and the food was straight foward for what you would expect from an italian restaurant abroad, this establishment is prominent in shanghai for its italian food offering the food is average and decent in terms of atmosphere it reminds me of a train station where people are in and out constantly and waitresses and waiters are off their feet juggling to serve everybody services attitude here is indifferent whenever you want service of the attendants even when you have eye contact with them they would still do something else or that they would only come to us later on without any acknowledgement another issue is that the staff here is a mixture of chinese westerners and filipinos and so its confusing when you speak chinese to them only to realise that they only speak english the menu is extensive dont expect to find anything out of ordinary but standard italian fares such as lasagna penne spaghetti etc for shanghai standard this place is perfectly fine it may not fare so well overseas when service and atmospheres expectations are much higher commendable visit though, very fine carte and great execution in all dishes both meat and fish great wine selection attention to real italian taste is evident and well performed prices are fair compared to quality and town average we returned multiple times to gather a real glimpe of what a fine italian restaurant looks like service is very good as well, really good filipino staff  really good food also it is a nice restaurant if you want to taste real italian or mediterranean food, have been coming here for years visited other locations and none are even come close in terms of food quality if you crave italian at reasonable prices try this one, this restaurant is one of the oldest italian establishment in shanghai the atmosphere is casual and friendly a great gathering place for family friends and business associates

the flavor is authentic and generously portioned in shanghai where good deals are becoming a rarity da marco still offers great value that keeps patrons from coming back time after time

for starter nice anti pasta and salad choices the pastas and the risotto are simply delicious and the  10 pizza is one of my favorite highly recommended a major portion of the staff are phillipino so communicating in english is never a problem there da marco offers an extensive wine list to choose from

da marco is usually my choice for taking my foreign friends to as their last meal in shanghai and after a full week of chinese meals i can see their eyes lit up when they are served with a hot plate of pasta and pizza comfort food at its best, there was a huge crowd at the restaurant mainly expats  the food was good comparatively and reasonably priced compared to other italian restaurant in shanghai, renowned italian restaurant with traditional dishes and wines very good value for price considering shanghai not a suggestive location and not romantic atmosphere
many italians like me come here when we miss our food, da marco has a big menu and therefore i recommend a generic approach for meat lovers the fileto for those who like fish the mixed fish grill among the pizzas the pizza salmone and definitely the seafood risotto
all of it is delicious, one of the best italian restaurants in shanghai if you are tired from chinese food welcome to restaurant da marco good quality of italian cousins friendly staff not expansive only one thing i didnt like  the wine was warm, it used to be one of the most famous italian restaurants in shanghai where all italian people used to gather to eat good and real italian food it had worsened in the years and now� wow� forget and stay away�
terrible pizza i had ordered pizza bianca with mozzarella and rucola the mozzarella was the lowest possible quality  the rucola stems had not been taken away hence hard to chew the tomatoes were not ripe and plastic like i had problem in finishing it
i ordered a home made gelato at the end and that was the worst as bad as the 5 rmb icecream in the cheapest shops
i sat next to the kitchen no professional cooks inside the chief cook was not wearing any hat the cheese and hams on the shop window were really low quality ones�
i am really sorry as i liked this place but it is miles away from the good restaurant it used to be
stay away, this restaurant was amongst the very first western and italian restaurant in shanghai very trendy for few years it has not changed a lot but still worthy to go for nice pizza or seafood","French cuisine",0.999477021901225
57,"i have been at el bodegon more than once and i had even celebrated my birthday there a few months
i decided to go back because i had a happy memory but i was wrong

we had booked a table for 3 people and the table was not ready we had to wait for 15 minutes which are not a lot but if i have booked i expect my table to be ready

then we ordered some drinks and we got a warm caipirinha we had to wait 10 minutes for the ice to chill it a bit but of course it became drown in water we ordered one plate of cheese which was at least that amazing and two salmon ceviche then we had some beef
unfortunately i cannot tell you how the meat was because both me and my other friend who was eating the ceviche like me felt sick like really sick we had to run to the bathroom both of us of course it was something in the fish or in the ceviche soup

it can happen mistakes can be made

however a mistake i really dont accept is the two ownerss behaviour who instead of feeling sorry and at least making a discount or being nice reacted badly and teased me saying i probably had an allergic reaction and that nobody else complained
how is it possible though that two people who have eaten the same thing feel sick at the same time
anyway last time there for me i wouldnt advise you on going back there, this is a very nice restaurant i really liked the atmosphere and the waiters great they served you quickly and you didnt have to wait too long for feb food why i give average the taste just a steak with fries and vegetables and no sauce didnt taste enough
same with the side dishes, my 3rd time to go to one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai the standard of service and chef is kept as before l enjoyed every time the packagesteak with beer or wine is so supervalue it is my frequent restaurant keep walking, one of my favorite been there several times and the quality of food and friendliness of service is consistent it is not a swanky place but i love it for its rustic unpretentious feel great for a casual dinner with friends, three of us had a fantastic meal here comprising of empanadas salmon ceviche beef skewers steaks rump and rib eye cheese cake and mousse all washed down with copious sangrias rum and colas and beers great evening with a bill around 400 rmb each

restaurant was full including people eating at the bar  so luckily we booked ahead

will definitely return to try many of the other menu items, we went on a saturday evening and we all ordered steak and agreed it was great quality meat red tender and juicy very well cooked in the grill the raw tuna we ate while waiting for the meat was really good too service was fast attentive and in english we were glad we reserved as the place was full, the food is unique and well priced there are some excellent ongoing steak deals that i recommend the staff are friendly and engaging and you get a sense of the latin american culture not only through the menu but also the decor and even the kind of beer available an easy and comfortable meal that wont blow your socks off but will leave you feeling very satisfied, had dinner here with a friend and the food was really good it is a great place to go if youre craving a bit of a break from chinese food the service was exceptional  we originally ordered the rump steaks but these were unavailable and the owner one of two brothers from buenos aires upgraded our steaks with no charge we took all of the servers suggestions and were not disappointed  the house ceviche was fresh and nicely seasoned and the dessert was exceptional the wine is also really amazing and very affordable the malbec was fantastic the only negative thing about this restaurant is that the bathrooms were freezing otherwise the night was perfect and ill definitely be back, i went a few months ago and will be going back soon the food selection is great and tastes even better than in looks they also have local beers and cocktails yum, there are a few argentina restaurant in sh el bodegon is one of my favourite and freequent restaurants the steak and beer and wine are with high level and imported from argentina chimichurri source is very unique and golden match with steak provoleta and ceviche are wonderful appetizerand dessertcoconut fran is fabulousthe pin number is wifi is maradona so shocked hum there are a lot of latin blondie guests and the atomosphere is very busting with exitement and very typical latin style the waiters and waitresses are very wonderful the bosses are very handsome argentinea guys i recommend the dinner promotion in evening in mon and tue and wed strongly because it is super worthpricesirloin or tenderloin or round steak and a bottle of imported beer or wine or sangria is 100 cny and 150 cny, wonderful dinner place always full house serve the good steak and wine very nice place plan for friends gathering  the service crew can speak english location no easy to find because they dont put the good signal in the front entrance downstairs , have been there several times and the quality has been always the same at a very high level the meat is just amazing and so are also the starters the prices are absolutely affordable for shanghai service is good you have to book a table if you go there at the weekend dont miss to try the argentinian beer, weve been going here about once a month for the last two years and have never been disappointed i like to support owneroperated places but only if the food and service is good and here it is
get the aji di gayina spelling is wrong its the peruvian chicken dish the boneless ribs the anticuchos the fish soup the provelone and of course the steaks deserts are all wonderful as well avoid the empanadas, great meat ask for the four cuts a sample of each of the diferent cuts bife de chorizo bife ancho cuadril and bife de lomo the ceviche is great too for dessert the alfajor the owners and waiters are very attentive and help you with the menu worth visiting starting with a delicious sangria, we came here for my boyfriends birthday dinner the food was amazing and it was the kind of place where you could dress up a little but it definitely wasnt stuffy one of the founders came right over to our table and told us about the food and the history of the restaurant and the culture behind it which was such a nice personal touch

we started with sangria and the tuna appetizer both delicious we moved on to ceviche before we ordered a tenderloin and a striploin the ceviche was great but the steaksomg i have never had steak that good both were cooked to perfection and they had been prepared slightly differently to bring out the flavor of the meat i cant wait to get back to this restaurant for another steak counting down the days to my birthday now haha

if you go definitely go for the ceviche and steak youd be ding yourself a disservice if you didnt, located on the 4th floor of 83 changshu road a little hidden from the street
the steaks are really good the stuff is english speaking and very friendly
if you want to enjoy a good steak in shanghai this is definitely the place to go, i go here at least twice a month and its always worth the money steaks seasoned and cooked to perfection with amazing appetizers like tuna and ceviche it always keeps me coming back plus the service is awesome, ive been there with friends and was a nice dinner spartan place but with criteria seems a real argentinian restaurant drinks are even from south america as well like the famous meat steak was perfect delicious and well cooked personnel is friendly and available a new must in shanghai, el bodegon is a nice argentinianperuvian cuisine restaurant located on the 4th floor of 83 changshu road it is a little hidden from the street it is a small intimate place with seating for two along the window wall the salmon ceviche was very good and fresh it was also a very nice portion even for a small order the skirt steak was cooked perfectly to my order and seasoned very well and not overpowering the spinach and riccotta cheese dumplings were really baked with a nice crust and more pie like then dumpling as an appetizer they were hard to split as there are only 3 but they were very good everything is alacarte but the helpings are just large enough to split some traditional flat bread or chips gratis would be a nice touch the service was quick and they were very attentive without being annoying the drinks were standard cocktails as is the wine list i would suggest making reservations as the space fills up fast even on a sunday night we arrived at 5pm and by the time we left at 720 every table was full, rustic place for argentinian food friendly stuff good drinks of course steaks are the first choice i had a mixture of 4 types of meat and three were delicious but my rump steak as well as the one of my wife was very hard besides that a nice place, what a pleasant surprise to see an argentinian chef cooking peruvian food  and it was very good the ceviche was fresh and the leche de tigre was devine maybe more fish in the plate could have been better but it was good
the argentinian meat was wonderful and my group of friends had a blast in this very traditionnal southamerican restaurant, every monday tuesday and wednesday el bodegon has a great dinner offer 200g steak and a glass of wine for 100rmb or a 300g and a glass of wine for 150 rmb

you can choose between 3 different steaks the rib eye is truly delicious and well seasoned there is some salad to the side but i advise to buy a side dish the mashed potatoes make a good combo the cheesecake also tasted delicious

the place is on the 4th floor and the entrance is straight across the elevator it is a real cozy place with friendly and well speaking english staff

try it out, they have a pretty great deal on wednesday 100rmb for steak and a glass of wineyou better order extra sides for25+ but its worth
the food was excellent i would recommend the rib eye and also the cheesecake was outstanding
the service was good also even the chinese waiters were polite proper english speaking and fine in general
the place a bit tricky to find but absolutly not crowdod at least worth to try, if you want to enjoy a good steak in shanghai this is definitely the place to go waiters are nice and some can even speak french , during the promotional period mon to wed they offer steak served with small salad and a glass of house wine for only 100 rmb the food is good and reasonably priced the staffs are helpful and spot on my friend dropped her drinks and the staff just quickly come to assist and replace her drinks free of charge overall it was a good experience and ill visit this restaurant more regularly for the steak deal, we had the steak milanesa ceviche tiraditos and for dessert alfajoresjust the way they taste in colombia we also had a looot of sangria everything was excellent and worth the trip and the price i would highly recommend this restaurant, for shanghai this restaurant is reasonably priced for a good steak we went on a friday evening and the restaurant was packedthe restaurant isnt very big and you would probably need to book in advance the staff was very attentive and did very well considering the number of people in my group, went with girlfriends on a saturday night this place is one of my favorites in shanghai i thoroughly suggest it for any type of meal date dinner with friends or cocktails and dinner good for celebrations too, great place not hard to find
enviroment is really nice and people is friendly i enjoyed talking in spanish with the people there
steak was awesome well cooked salad also was good and malbec made the perfect fit for the food
prices are ok i think in shanghai
i will be back for sure to try more options from the menu they have

i would recommend it 100 for having a good steak

this place got now a new mexican fan on their list

saludos, this is a real treat and find all in one tucked away on an upper floor on a main road not 500 metres from the hilton hotel
the place has a real bodega feel good atmosphere with a little serving bar the menus in dual language and of course the steaks we had tenderloin with roasted vegetables and a few little tapas style nibbles

we were a party of seven mixed between french chinese and english with different but fully satisfied tastes

the steaks were beautifully done and good cocktail list and beers

excellent meal as we stayed awake following an early arrival to shanghai and a meeting topped out with a relaxing meal one argentinian and one uruguyan guy serving and you can just see the busy little kitchen

a good mix of clientele from couples business and families a great start to the trip, we shared the 4 meat sampler a ceviche and the provoleta along with a good malbec by the glass everything was excellent service excellent appealing atmoshere price very reasonable we most definitely be back soon, excellent steaks compared to shanghai standards and also very reasonable priced recommend trying the four cuts to sample different parts of steak visited during saturday night and the place was quite busy  had to wait for a table for a while recommend making reservation on weekends, its a peruvianargentine restaurant owned by two 2 argentines
the beef and meat are great argentine side the peruvian food on the otherside is far from being typical peruvian but they try  the pisco sour on the other hand was quite good and the prices are very reasonable
the owners and staff are very friendly it was funny to hear the chinese waiters speaking a bit of spanish
overall recommended, got a glass of wine and a great steak for 100rmb was with salad but added fries for 20rmb tried the coconut mojito and liked it always have mojito and this was an 8 of 10 on my mojito scale friendly staff who speaks english

shared toilet but ok cleaned with paper and soap but no heat, best steak ive had in shanghai and i live here for a very reasonable price cocktails are also very good their peruvian pisco sour is rumoured to be the best in town ceviche can also be highly recommended, had a fabulous time and awesome food here they provided a baby chair a fluffy toy for the baby delicious red wine fantastic steak go for medium rare rib eye its amaaaazing and really really yummy starter ceviche bodegon excellent all over, this is more of a place to go for easy drinks with friends or colleagues they have good deals on happy hour till 22 00 pm 50 off steaks on some days ceviches are great fish soup rich but portion could be more generous same goes to size of empanadas but again highly recommend, we went there last sunday and it was very nice again this time i have as a starter ceviche bodegon it�s raw sea bass in lemon sauce and on top crunchy fried calamari main as usual the top steak if you take the brunch set  120rmb + 20 extra for steak it comes with 2 cocktail�s or drink�s my favourite is pisco sour, went here on a thursday night with some freinds all steaks are currently half price and they have happy hour on beer at 25 rmb tried an argentinian beer for the first time called quilmes  which was top notch  will definately be looking out for this again

as for the food we all ordered the 4 cuts of steak this was 100g of each of the steaks they offer meat was excellent and cooked well

they also have a peruvian menu on offer although none of us tried that so cant comment

service was quick and staff were freindly cant fault the place really ill be back, el bodegon serves interesting innovative latin american food in shanghai the management are argentinian and peruvian and they offer a range of dishes from both countries they have argentinian steaks and more unusual unexpected fusion style dishes form peru with asian influences apparent we have enjoyed all the dishes we have tried on our two visits to this restaurant in addition the restaurant is simple but has a nice secluded atmosphere and is very tasteful the service is always attentive and personal

our one small gripe is the size of the servings which can be just a little on the small size for the price but then perhaps this goes with the territory of this sort of restaurant we would definitely recommend it to people wanting something different in shanghai, i have been with fiends because recommendations we found great service and hospitality food was nice if i have to add anything just the quantity was no so much enjoy, found out this place for an accident but the food is surprised me more it is just so good just love it you should definitely try this if you got this opportunity to visit shanghai just come, we enjoyed the atmosphere and the great food we definitly spent a good night the service provided was perfect we will return there for sure, we been here 56 times now the steaks and cocktail are really good the stuff is very friendly there have always 50 off on steaks and cocktail and no tourists a definitely must go if you a steak lover, this is my fourth time here over the last couple of monthsthis place is fantastic

the steaks are super juicy very high quality for anywhere but especially for shanghai the marinated tuna  tirradotos atun is extremely deliciousand the ceviche is really good too seriously the best tuna ever and for sure try the gin and tonic argentinoa gt infused with mate an argentinean herb teatotally addictive

if you live in shanghai or are just visiting you really owe it to yourself to stop by here the owners are always on site making sure that your entire experience is memorable m in a good way, we enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and the variety of the great food
really wonderful

all delish
service was good and swift only annoying thing was a couple of flies in there buzzing around i hate that its a steak place and i didnt get to try one apart from the skewer which was good i have another voucher so i may go back and try dinner there one evening, we came here with a party of 8 no idea a restaurant could be found in a 4th floor of a commercial building not a common thing back home i had no idea what to expect until i was greeted by two southamericans who i learned after are the actual owners the place was packed on a friday night it felt both like a bar and a restaurant i have to admit that after spending 3 months in asia i was desperate for uruguayan steak except for the empanadas and the chorizo delicious all starters were peruvian this place is actually a strange for me as a southamerican combination of peruvian and argentinian food so the starters we shared were possibly the best ceviche ive ever had an addictive peruvian sashimi and some of the best fried prawns ive ever had although fried prawns are hard to miss except that the two sauces made the whole difference now to the real deal steak well not from uruguay but our argentinian cousins are pretty good at it medium rare strip loin steak cooked to perfection service was great but as we share pretty much the same culture and accent it felt like home to me we all had a really good time cocktails were honest and generous dessert tasted like homemade and the service was exceptional come for the steak though","bar",0.93398891940524
58,"this is a wonderful breakfast buffet with many cuisine choices standard american dim sum japanese shanghai dumplings and pancakes made to order omelettes etc the staff is fantastic anticipating youre every desire, the food is excellent i stayed for six nights and had the salmon fillet three times wonderful food for breakfast id love to see natural muesli added to the selection i also stayed over the spring festival period in january so the cafe was very busy as such it needed more service staff to attend to guests a few times i had to get up and look for a waiter as service was rather ordinary having said that would i return most certainly the overall experience surpassed any of the improvement suggestions ive posted here the views are incredible and the quality of the food was impressive very generous portions to keep me fuelled up for the travel, ive been coming to the jw for a few years now im happy to report their famous breakfast buffet has to be one of the best breakfast buffet offerings in the world basically you name it they have it

from chinese noodle soup to freshly made omlettes  to hand cut salmon and everything in between this buffet is tops theres also fresh dim sum yogurt and tons of freshly baked pastries

the service has gotten better over the years and on this visit it was no exception also they make an excellent cappuccino

if youre staying at the jw or anywhere close make sure you try the buffet breakfast here at the jw marriott shanghai, really good the have many variety of foods staff are really cooperative over all nice place for family dinning, as expected the views from the room was amazing the food selection for breakfast in the main restaurant and in the club lounge was excellent the hotel is easy to get to via metro from the airport, this is just one of a number of restaurants in the hotel and we used it twice their version of a local noodle dish was excellent with a generous portion st a reasonable price, we were staying at the golden court serviced apartment near the marriott and as an option tried their breakfast great surprise great display of options costuming and great omelettes chicken kebab variety of breads great juices cold cuts and warm fried chinese what else can one desire service was excellent and good english we returned twice, this is one of several fine dining options at this shanghai hotel the food was well prepared and the service is excellent, if you cannot find something you liek for breakfast here you are too picky omlets eggs waffles are made to order all different ethnicities represented in the food options fresh juice was always abundant great value and and amazing way to start the day, i enjoyed breakfast here a number of times very extensive offering all the usual offerings and much more

the staff are very professional and friendly, what a delight this restaurant was we traveled up into the sky to enjoy the breathtaking exterior views then turned our eyes inside to see row upon row of the most wonderful fresh fish meat soup breads all you could want the sushi was so cold and delicious it was my first time ever trusting the preparation and i ate it with gusto
king crab legs indian curries fresh fish dishes i went a little crazy eating things that i had no idea of eating before
the dinner was a celebration of two families becoming united in love over one perfect little granddaughter and i will never forget it the care and love you put into our food made our evening and our joy even greater
wonderful among the best meals i have ever had the delight of enjoying thank you, we enjoyed the breakfast buffet here and we also enjoyed dinner here the breakfast buffet has an amazing variety and the dinner menu is interesting with something for everyone ranging from pizza and hamburgers to steak and chinese food a nice option when you dont feel like venturing out to the bund or elsewhere, great choice when staying at the jw marriott tomorrow square or in the vicinity i had several meals here with business associates and enjoyed the tasty food and good service recommended, the restaurant offered a good varied buffet selection for breakfast ice cream was yummy definitely better than the chinese restaurant in the hotel, great food and service the chef was great stopped by and chatted at our table really a fantastic job our servers name was april han she was terrific very personable and professional i would not be surprised to go back to the hotel and find out she was actually a manager if she isnt she should be great experience, this marriott is my favorite hotel in shanghai and in large part this is due to the high quality and value breakfast at this cafe the quality of the breakfast is a cut above the food at other 5 star hotels in the city
and most importantly the service and attention to customers satisfaction is incredible very attentive but not over bearing sincerity and friendliness is all over this restaurant each time i stay at this hotel i am impressed with at least one standout employee during my most recent visit it was april han remembered my name and went out of her way to ensure everything was perfect, the marriott cafe offers an outstanding experience for breakfast the staff is very friendly and attentive the variety quality and presentation of the food is excellent i am looking forward to returning soon, stayed 4 nights at jw marriott and mostly enjoyed breakfast meal at the marriott cafe food variety is great but not very different by each day

it was great except two things
1 salmon was not properly cutt so people were struggling
2 so i asked one of the staffs one with short hairslightly touching shoulder lengthwho wears black fluttering pants about the salmon if someone would be cutting i am not sure if it was her english or attitude she said no and then walked away very unprofessional of her it kind of ruined my good experience at the cafe hopefully in near future you train your staff members on how to help guests, excellent hotel from location to service to amenities and room comfort recommend staying in a corner room for astounding 180� views of shanghai bathroom with same jaw  dropping views of skyline is generous and spacious with glass shower fullsize tub makeup mirror and well designed lighting room itself is spacious with seating area and 60 tv competing with the views
staff was incredibly welcoming addressing us by name and making suggestions for tours food and transportation steve and april are prime examples o hotel also has multiple restaurants and amenities which we did not take advantage of during our short stay only regret is that we did not stay longer than one night, we had the breakfast buffet here for two mornings and it was good both times we also ate an early dinner and i thought my food was very good and did my coworker who i was traveling with, we heart buffets especially scrumptious and decadent spread found in highend asia hotels the jw marriotts marriott cafes sunday brunch was definitely an indulgence and appreciated for having a wide variety to choose from

id especially enjoyed the fresh sashimi king crab and the seared foie gras for a while there our home city had a ban on restaurants serving foie gras so we reckon weve missed out on vitamin fg for a few years now and well i was making up some lost time and indulged in lots of it today, loved this one for brunch great options for eastern or western food lots of seafood and not all of it in heavy cream sauce meat was good although they are a little stingy with giving you more than a 2 cm square piece i really enjoyed brunch on sunday there, many options and everything i tried was very good western and eastern options as well as fruit and desserts, we had breakfast for three days the service was fantastic the offerings were extensive we were even able to get indian parathas and upma traditional indian breakfast along with western and chinese food johnson the manger was very attentive amy and deepak who served us were fantastic i would highly recommend this place, the marriott cafe at jw marriott tomorrow square offers both a buffet and a la carte menu we had the dinner buffet one evening but found it inferior to offerings at other jw hotels we had experienced service was very good food quality good but choices not very extensive for the price there are better choices in the area, good location the cloud is good staff and management are keen on making you feel good whether you have a big meal or just drinks add it as place to try, prices are not that expensive so i guess it doesnt make it that bad and its clean and well presented restaurant has beautiful open views and staff are very helpful but ive definitely tasted better my son enjoyed the sliders but on multi occasions my meals were not flavorful nor satisfying its ok if youve just come back from a long day and dont want to leave the hotel again but otherwise there are many better for the price, as i said in my review of this hotel the breakfast in the cafe is incredible every conceivable item is hereand its a bargain at us $25 per person, everything except for spicy wonton which was shockingly bland 

order from the tea selection its well worth the price

expensive but great experence, the buffet in this place had everything dumplings soup bar omelets station congee station salad bar fruit bar etc we had breakfast here everyday and dinner once the dinner was about 350rmb per person and there was some seafood the meat was tough in my opinion but there was a good selection of international cuisine not sure it would be my top dinner pick thought, the breakfast was very expensive but worth every penny and kids eat free easily the best ive had in asia i didnt eat any other meals there because i was never in the building at other meal times but if their lunches and dinners are half as good, i have stayed at the jw marriott 4 times in the past 8 months and it has become the last meal for my team we all order the marriott burger it is a thick burger topped with cheese and all the trimmings can beat this with an ice cold beer, the food at the breakfast buffet was excellent especially the pastries the variety was amazing eating here was a great way to start the day, it was convenient after a long day kind of expensive i think it was on the 40th floor you have the option to order a meal or self service buffet, a dirty coffee cup at breakfast see pic and inattentive service do their waiters and waitresses go on eye contact avoidance training

come on jw  you are better than this  and at over 500rmb for breakfast for two you need to be, a nice and bright restaurant to grab a bite in and an excellent vantage point from which to get a panoramic view of shanghais puxi area

located on the 38th floor of the hotel the same as the hotels lobby

more spacious and relaxing atmosphere than the darkish and much more formal lounge bar two floors up

the buffet breakfast offers a huge colourful spread, this was good fr a quick bite to eat but the cost was fairly high you can also go here to get a power adapter, low food quality for more than 60 dollars per person, as the title states i am not impressed with this restaurant this restaurant has both buffet and a la carte however i advise you to eat the buffet as the a la carte is overpriced and most can be found in the buffet this restaurant has a smoking section which is not inclosed so smoke from the area driftes through and smells very bad when i asked one of the waiters about this he rudely said its ok to smoke i wasnt expecting that from a 5stared hotel and certainly not from a jw marriott furthermore the food there was average and is heavily overpriced and i will never go back there again if you want to eat in the jw marriott building i recommend the jw california grill its really good food and only slightly overpriced, we arrived in shanghai too late to scout for food so opted for this midpriced hotel cafe on the 38th floor not a good introduction to shanghai cooking it was nearly 10pm and the place was all but deserted yet the fullystaffed service was annoyingly slow caesar salad 68 yuan was acceptable pot stickers 48 yuan were very good but small the 6 sticks of chicken satay 58 yuan were an impressive achievementthe least amount of chicken meat that could possibly be attached to a skewer they tasted tired like yesterday�s reheated satay sarawak laksa 88 yuan was tasty but had all of two tiny shrimp and about a tablespoon of chicken shreds it was 95 noodles a 15 surcharge was added","Sichuan cuisine",0.963955783191911
59,"the view from the restaurant at the pudong shangrila is fantatic the place has ambition to be a first rate french restaurant the food disappointed me a bit with being too complex in my taste further the service was often slow and not in line with the ambition of the place i got my wine bottle after the second course again the view did much to compensate, its an excellent place to have a drink or 2 the place is not very big and bit pricey its on 36th floor and have expansive views of shanghai across river the staff is great and friendly

it should be paid a visit at least once for the experience if you are around this area, at the end of a busy working day my colleague  i decided we just had to have one last drink at the bar up on the 36th floor of the pudong shangrila hotel a nice young lady helped us to find a table with a partial view of out onto the spectacular light show on the neighbouring buildings outside we ordered our night caps and then snapped off a few photos of the views

there was great live music with a lady with a sweet voice i would have stayed longer but my colleague was dog tired and i didnt fancy continuing the paying the very high prices up there, went there for dinner resturant looks nice and the staff were very polite high level hospitality the view is quite nice it was the first time for me to look on the bund from pudong side atmosphere was good except of the fact that were children in the resturant which we didnt expect in such level of resturant the food we started with vegetables the plate with tomatoes was ok but the veg mouse was tasteless  like eating margarine than we had mains the beef and the veal were very very good cooked to perfect although too tiny portions desert of lemon pie was just ok the peer in the chocolate bowl was really good all in all for 3 dishes each and half bottle of french wine we paid ~rmb1500 which is a bit high for what we got not bad for sure but also not great just ok, amazing this beautiful restaurant on the 36 floor offers very special food every dish was surprising and tasty, bar  restaurant on 36th floor with views towards city and the well known telecommunicatio tower which is lit up at night with array of colours great place for a night cap after dinner, if youre a foodie and appreciate quality food this is one of shanghais best buffet with excellent tasting food first off the restaurants view is unbeatable and the restaurant itself has a very exclusive feel the appetiser buffet set up is refreshing not overly done with visuals and blings it is elegant and understated the quality of the dishes speaks for itself and limited choices makes one appreciate each dish more  a welcomed change from the usual endless spreads of mediocre quality dishes that is usual for hotel sunday brunches the spread displays cooking technique skills avantgarde flavours and the right portions to keep your appetite going through out the brunch the champagne service is generous unlike in some brunches where one feels there is a need to be grateful for each refill even if you had purchased a freeflow package the main courses highlights a trip to kitchen where there is a dish representing each main meat lamb beef pork seafood lobstershrimpsfish i liked that it is simple and straightforward everything on offer was lighttasting allowing me enjoy several sites without feeling gluttonous must order is the personal dish of the chefs take on traditional french omelette  caviar or truffle  makes this brunch experience unique and a definite must come back again place, very good place for brunch although not cheap if you choose go with champagne great view and great ambience in restaurant selection of food on buffet is limited and giving an impression of high end quality food although you still can have black caviar oysters some spanish cold cuts and some appetizers what taste really good main course is ordered from kitchen and done up to upscale casual dining very limited selection but still would do desert trolley is very limited and just ok
service is very good and covers up for lack of varieties of food very attentive and not greedy when it comes to serve champagne when official hours for brunch is finished
set up of buffet not well thought gives a feeling of temporarily set up with no desire to impress a guests
overall is very good, the view and the service at the restaurant are truly excellent the food is hitandmiss a little too much molecularinspired cuisine for my taste that said the crab and scallop appetizer was delicious, drinks and gatherings and catch up  live music generally a great night out without being in a night club, a spectacular brunch with a perfect view to the bund the food selection is well chosen and the taste is excellent an interesting twist is that for the main dishes you are allowed to go into the kitchen to select and discuss with the cook
the seating arrangement are nice and with enough space to give you feeling of privacy

to sum it up 
nice food
nice ambiente
nice staff with eyes for the details
and a breath taking view, on my first visit to jade on 36 the service ws flawless a warm greeting was given and i was escorted straight away to a table with a fantastic view of the river and the bund the wait staffs service was also flawless the menu was brought straight away and professionally explained by the knowledgeable wait person the 3 course meal i chose was immaculately presented and served promptly the plates for the hot dishes were heated as they should be the food was not 5 star quality taste was but was very pleasant i was impressed and booked again for the following night

that booking for night 2 was a last minute one i was initially told there were no spare seats but then at the last minute was told by horizon club staff that i could get a seat at the shared tabl which was fine upon arrival the front of the house person who spoke very limited english my fault that i do not speak mandarin not hers did not seem to have me on her seating list after some consultation i was guided to the shared table with apologies given that they could not give me a better seat i was then left to twiddle my figures for a good 5 minutes at least without being provided a menu and without anyone at all approaching me to take drink orders very disappointing it was however a public holiday and they were heavily booked eventually the menu was provided by a helpful wait person who gave great guidance on the food choices that is when the evenings experience went downhill badly the restaurant manager was involved in an animated dispute with a very persistent guest they stood in the middle of the restaurant blocking my view of part of the river and while i could not hear what they were saying this guests performance completely destroyed the restaurant atmosphere the manager called for a chinese speaking manager who came and there were then 3 people blocking my view this unbelievably went on for at least 30 minutes when i complained later to the manager about this performance he did say that teh guest would not go somewhere private to talk nevertheless this performaance should not have been allowed to carry out for any length of time  let alone 30 minutes my appetizer was well presented but the taste was bland my main course was lamb it was presented immaculately on a nicely heated plate was cooked to perfection but was luke warm there was no one to complain to as the manager was involved with the 30 minute theatrical performance with the guest and no wait staff approached me to ask how the meal was or to ask if i wanted more wine etc so i ate it i should have taken it back myself to the wait staff and asked for a new main this was the worst dish i have ever been served at a high quality restaurant after i finished that dish the manager having finished his 30 minute meeting and escorted the other manager out passed by my table and came to clear my plate away i then complained about the theatrical performance and the luke warm lamb he immediately offered to credit the cost of the lamb course so it was free but failed to do so offered me a glass of free wine with dessert which i had and offered me free drinks at the bar which i declined as i had work to do the manager did a great job to placate me

the dessert which followed was again well presented but was not 5 star quality

a very mixed experience which makes it very difficult to rate this restaurant the manager is new and has a lot of work to do to improve the consistency of this restaurant clearly he cannot afford to waste 30 minutes on one rude aggressive guest  , and if you can shell out $120 per person for a limitless coffee champagne lobster and buffet brunch do it beautiful view great service nice buffet and several custom entree options including lobster scallops chicken etc definitely a splurge, my wife and i went there on a weekday so it was very quiet and we could sit near the windows an absolute must especially in the evening with all the lights of the puxi side of the river and boats going up and downstream the river as background
the staff is very helpful and does speak english which is very appreciated as the menu can be a little complex if you are not a native french speaker the chef is french and the menu breathes fusion food from france to asia
we liked our courses a lot although sometimes the dishes had so surprising tastes that it can throw you off if youre used to purer tastes of the ingredients you order
prices are in the range of restaurants of this range  location
i really liked the fact that the chef was walking out of his kitchen to come meet the guests although he was not coming specifically for us he still stopped at our table and chatted a bit with us nice personal touch, during my last visit to shanghai  i was invited by my chinese friends for lunch at this delicious restaurant  it is on the 36th floor of the shangri la hotel  mostly when tourist visit shanghai  to go to the bund and look at the view of pudong  call me old school  i came to shanghai the first time in 1979  i still have pictures from the top of the peace hotel   and i am nostalgic about the old bund  to see the total view of the bund from pudong  is for me  10 times more spectacular  now regarding the food it was delicious and i saw that for lunch the price for 2 or 3 courses is extremely reasonable for this star quality restaurant  my advise  go quickly before they get a michelin and raise their prices , if you want to have a great brunch with good food and lot of champagne this is the place you will also have a stunning view over shanghai, the night i was at the jade on 36 there was live music and the crowd was sparse the cocktail menu was fun but the service was average get a table by the window your guests will be impressed if i were the manager of the place i would instill some confidence in the wait staff with their english language ability it will change their attitude about the job and improve interaction with the guests, jade is one of those places you can take someone to impress them a good first date place for a drink before dinner or a nice catch up with someone esp if theyre picking up the tab i had lunch drinks and dinner here all on different days lunch was a buffet and was fairly ordinary nothing remarkable at all in part because shanghais pollution makes any views disappear in the day jade really comes into its own at night when the city lights are popping drinks in the bar were great lots of options for cozy nooks and the band was just right we then moved to the restaurant and dinner was good food but slow service, shame that such potential is let down by basic errors and average service come up gor the view and a drink but donr expect anything too special still has smoking here so give it a miss if you dont like that had a great band on thursday night

not bad as a skyline bar but not great either

dont go for the flight of cocktails unless you like lots of sweet sickly drinks, id expected high end fine dining but was rather disappointed to find the place rather casual this is not what this restaurant is known for
food was excellent and creative view is unbeatable but service was not onpar friendly but not professional enough for the price we paid
overall it looks like the restaurant is trying to find a second life in a different class didnt work for me , after a first excellent dinner a few months ago we invited a couple of friends last saturday and we had a superb dinner once again yes the view is great but the content of your plates too the cooking is a very well done mix of classical french an international food with a twist of originality all is well balanced and simply delicious there is also in some dishes some slight asian influence present the outcome is what we can expect from a restaurant of this level we will be back again, i spent a great friday evening with my friend at jade36
they have perfect position not too high but high enough at lujiazhui you can enjoy the whole view of the huangpu river and the bund
this is a creative french restaurant with absorbing the taste of chinese food take an example the beef with toast would reminds you everything about your mother or grandmother kitchen it is very special
the dish of fat liver with suger would make you think you are a happy child at that moment
the service also make you very cozy at home
i would definitely come back again, spent a few late evenings up at jade 36 often there is great entertainment and it stays open very late great views looking over to the bund area, i love this resturant since i enter this place  everything was so neat and clean  compare to another resturant that i visited before  here was more suitable for business chatting  couple dating  high level of service will let you feel impressive  thank you for treat us well , i have dine in this resturant last few days with my friends  they have floor to ceiling window  then while you enjoy the meal  you also can enjoy the nice view of shanghai  this is my first time visited this amazing place  i do belive i will come back once i visit shanghai again  i love the location  the embiance  and how the food be presented  everything was so perfect  just want to say thank you to jade 36 team jake for provide truly professional excellent service , excellent restaurant with a spectacular view
very good food excellent wine choice stylish decoration and very friendly staff  for us one of the best restaurants in shanghai  not to be missed , good bar and great cocktails music was not much to talk about the crowd is largely a business crowd, just been to jade on 36 this evening and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner with a todiefor view of the beautiful shanghai bund the music the ambience  we are transported back in time to when life was slower and gentler 
the food is good to excellent and the service is impressive for shanghai
overall its the perfect place for an unforgettable evening in shanghai, i booked a spot here for my girlfriends parents 30th anniversary given the task of impossible to impress my future inlaws who was never a fan of european dishes was tough

however jade on 36 exceeded my expectations with top quality service and attention from the staff from the beginning to the end of our meal

the food was fantastic impressed by the range of creativity in each dish chef jeremy biasol has a fantastic view and respect on food the main important point is it delicious absolutely there is not questions asked each dish was cooked executed perfectly wines also complemented each dish well giving my inlaws a night to remember

we will be visiting again on our next trip back to shanghai, i never write harsh reviews here we go

as a lone diner it is never easy you feel a little uncomfortable to start with being alone amongst the couples and groupswell the staff at jade made me feel like a leper restaurant lesson number one  make your guests feel comfortable and at home

i had to ask for the wobbly table to be steadied water to be bought to me and then i had to almost stand up and get someone to give me a menu as for a glass of wine and gosh i needed it by this stage well there was no one to help me  they all seemed to be over therethis is not a big restaurant at all with plenty of staff but they failed badly to do their job
as for the dinner  it was rather nice but the papillote of fish  it was in tin foildo i want a fish in foil  no  it is not right to serve papillote fish in foil
papillote = parchment
this is supposed to be a high class expensive french restaurantmmmmm

all it ended up being was expensivenothing else sadly, this restaurant was revamped about a year ago to make it a more casual experience than the previous fine dining one food is still very good and prices now are lower view of the river and the bund is absolutely fantastic, joined a few of the hotel staff for a drink and appetizers and tthe food chef staff and view was absolutely so glad we did not eat the egg appetizer cannot remember what it was called is a must try, the food was cooked to perfection as well as the presentation was beautiful  the interior was superb with breathtaking views, came here for the set dinner tonight after seeing the good reviews was extremely disappointed the price was 688 for a set christmas special dinner 988 with wine included a ~2000 rmb cost for two not including taxgratuity service was good and the view was good but the food was in a word bland the lobster salad had no flavor and the soup was lukewarm while the soft boiled egg in the middle of the soup was cold as though they had just pulled an egg out of the fridge and stuck it in the hot soup cooling it the scallops were not very well done they tasted frozen and werent seasoned enough my gf said my scallops were better and im a terrible cook even the dessert was poor the scoop of ice cream was very hard frozen almost it was hard to even dig into it and they mixed it with some weird things including what tasted like popcorn portion sizes for everything were tiny as well

the only saving grace was the main course of turkey which was actually delicious a pity none of the other dishes came even close to matching it oh wait the appetizer was also decent as well i suppose

was the food terrible no it was ediblebut for 2000 rmb id expect a hell of a lot more than edible i wouldve given three stars if this was a 1000 rmb meal but for the price i can only give it 2 great view and great service but the food and the lack of value killed it given the other reviews here im going to guess that they were just overwhelmed with christmas service and completely lost their qc either way  i would not repeat, this restaurant can be found on the 36th floor of the shangri la hotel loved the interior design of the restaurant here you will find some really exquisite dishes amazing views overlooking a very modern landscape, we were allocated a table at the window with an awesome view of the bund

waiting staff were friendly attentive and knowledgeable and accommodative  they even requested for engineering department to lower the aircond temperature when we told them it was a bit warm

the wine list was extensive and offered great choices with some available by the glass

for starters we ordered the foie gras and mackerel tartare the foie gras was delicious but the mackerel tartare was literally tasteless apart from the fishy smell luckily there was sea salt and pepper available at the table

for mains we had australian wagyu steak medium rare which was absolutely delicious and value for money and the lamb shank was just soso really nothing to shout about

i would strongly recommend the wagyu steak for what it is worth you can hardly get this type of wagyu quality even in australia

will i return yes but only for the wagyu steak, just back from another trip to shanghai last friday night my best friends from ningbo and shanghai invited us to dinner and selected jade on 36 as the place to meet i knew the meal would be wonderful but what followed was beyond expectations chef jeremy came to our table to welcome us and when my friends asked what the chef would recommend he countered by asking what we might not like when my friends said they love to eat chef jeremy beamed with delight and asked if he might prepare the evenings meal for us
we spent the next few hours tasting a succession of dishes each was a visual masterpiece and an epicurean delight chef jeremy biasiol our michelin chef is a true artist his canvas is the kitchen and ingredients at his disposal the results are pure masterpieces
jade on 36 has my vote as the finest dining experience in shanghai, the view from a window table over the huangpu river is sensational the wines on offer from many countries is extensive the fit out is modern and interesting the service is impeccable right up to the moment when you have to drag yourself away even the lift button down is taken care of by one of the staff just for you its not exactly a cheap place to eat unsurprisingly for our table of 4 the meal comprising reasonably sized good tasting entrees and mains as well as a couple of vegetable side dishes bottled flat waters a moderately priced bottle of nz white wine and a couple of coffees it set us back around <u+00a5>2500 was it worth it yes certainly given the overall experience you will probably need to budget for it making it an occasional meal or visit rather than a weekly regular venue dishes including lamb shanks potato and lamb pie veal steaks were perhaps not sensational but were still very nice the atmosphere of the place though felt special and was well worth a visit tip book a few days in advance and make sure you arrange a window table, on saturday september 19 2015 my friends organized my shanghai farewell dinner in the pdr at jade restaurant on the 36th floor of the shangrila hotel in pudong shanghai
chef jeremy biasiol is continuing the excellent tradition set by his predecessors chefs franckelie and fabrice jeremy and his crew did an unbelievable incredible excellent job it was brilliant both in terms of creativity as well as execution with a superb wine pairing by dennis
if anybody in shanghai really wants to get surprised by a culinary marvel his friends should do the same organize a dinner together with chef jeremy at jadeon36 and wait for the dessertonthetable , i visited the restaurant a few days ago and it is amazing view and excellent service  i celebrated my birthday with my boyfriend and chef jermey offer me a complimentary dessert and that is quite suprised for us we took really beautiful night and i will defintey come back again by the way  the shrimp cocktail is wonderful, ive been here many times so this is a general review

the view service food and atmosphere are all great

the mostly good and little bad
if they still have the mussels night on
tuesday go for it wonderful taste and very good value i didnt realize i liked mussels so much until i had these

ive been in private groups many times when the chef has wowed us with surprises the attached picture shows a custom dessert table a real culinary experience expensive but great for a special memorably occasion

2015 saw the demise of their best in shanghai brunch it is now quite poor value relative to other brunches i hope they improve it

, the menu selection is quite limited compared to a normal chinese restaurant but again this is not a chinese restaurant it took us a while to decide on a dish the fish dishes and the beef cheek dish were excellent avoid the duck dish it was so hard i could not even cut it and had to send it back to the kitchen the arrival of the dishes was odd our 4 main dishes came about at different times 2 minutes apart i wouldnt expect this at a 5 star restaurant the view is to kill for and the restaurant deco is beautiful book a table at the window you have to specify at the window for which you get only two seating choices 5 pm or 8 pm bottled imported water is super expensive in china it costs almost 15 dollars for 750ml of evian or badoit including services and tax, this hotel is situated in the ideal spot in shanghai but the food was average to say the least they are famous for peking duck which tasted nice but it was cold not hot but we had a great evening nevertheless but it is extremely expensive for the quality of the chinese food, great menu with an amazing selection of bread the service was excellent and the whole experience happened in a very pleasant atmosphere moreover there is a very extensive selection of burgundy domaine de la romanee conti on the wine list, i was only there for happy hour and a little longerbut the service was great food options were good great live music and sweet views of shanghai the place also has a really nice ambiance to it goid time, this is a beautiful experience as the sun sets if the skies are clearer than usual you have that then the magic really begins as shanhai begins to light up the strange tower alongside is particularly impressive it comes on in all is strange glory at seven

i was guided to this place by an affable and knowledgeable dutchman now a friend who has spent a lot of time here in china i think that he knows from where to see shanghais lights come up bar rouge is also good and where we first met 

the drinks were fine we didnt have anything exotic or difficult the snack was a clever and tasty mix of dehydrated chili slices and peanuts that i love the bar is lovely elegant slightly formal and the menu in the restaurant on the other side looks delicious

all around this was a memorable experience especially since accompanied by an experienced traveller waxing knowledgeably about doing business in china which he seems know rather well including culturally after his many visits here and in other parts chinese

i recommend twilight here , greeted by chef jeremy biasiol  staff at the lift heading to a great start foie gras pan seared and poached in sangria wine looks great  taste great the lollipop and the rock candies was a nice surprise roast of the day was veal loved by all pork cordon bleu was a surprise not what i expected but it was great so tender the kids kept asking for more caesar salad scallops slow cooked salmon all dishes were great including the bread  the welcoming cheese puff molten chocolate cake raspberry tiramisu  banana pie yummy the empty plates says it all reasonable price great view great service  great chef  team behind the scene i have already recommended to my friends and will be sure to return and try more, i visited this restaurant before and it was fine dining it has been long time not come to jade because of the work  i have no idea that it changed but it is beyond my expectation honestly the bund view is still there and gorgeous as before and food is much more different from fine dining i enjoy it especially the lobster salad the staff told me it is a new dish i strongly recommend to taste it the service is excellent and i have no idea of her name that she is professional, i visit shanghai frequently and this was on my list to try for quite some time what a delight the views are absolutely stunning the servers were as attentive as any in the world every dish was fabulous, in the past i was very critical of jade on 36 at the shangrila felt it was pretentious and overly expensive to my utter delight and surprise executive chef nicholas blair introduced me to the new jade on 36 the view is idyllic chef jeremy biasiol is now in charge of the restaurant incredible chef jeremy formerly owned a michellin rated restaurant in hong kong but had to close it as the real estate rent kept increasing beyond what he could afford  even for hong kong now chef jeremy has transformed jade on 36 into an affordable delight no longer pretentious and over priced a relaxed warm inviting atmosphere with a delectable array of dishes and reasonably priced for a meal of this quality i love pudong shangrila now it is truly michellin in paradise do not be surprised if chef jeremy stops by your table to converse with you a wonderful man and his food is  well michellin rated","Turkish cuisine",0.999759930009452
6,"nice ambience for business dinner or for an evening with a friend excellent food with a professional service a place ill visit again, inventive exquisite and out of this world cuisine with an amazing service and great ambience shanghais very best for sure, this place is consistently innovative we have been visiting for 6years and this is our treat at the end of a visit food is exquisite the lemon on lemon tart is a sight to beholdwine list extensive staff are attentive this has always been a restaurant a cut above the rest, it is most expensive place to have foods in shanghai without having invitation its not easy to decide to come this area the bund atmosphere is great foods are the level i expected to this type of area and place, nice views and decent menu ive been here several times but on my last visit everyones silverware in our party was dirty when the silverware is not clean this gives me pause i cant complain about anything else staff is attentive enough food tastes good good place to bring visitors, decor is fun and funky  ring bell to be admitted cavernous place that is a cross between versailles and a warehouse amazing pudong view food tasty except the grilled vegetables antipasti that were so salty as to be almost inedible experience was disappointing although these are frenchinfluenced western dishes food was served chinese style appetizers mains etc all showed up at once so what should have been a relaxed luxurious experience felt hurried and confused and half the food was cold by the time we go to eat it glad we tried it but for this price i would not go again, the setting is perfect for a night cap their late night menu available on thursday friday and saturday nights after 11 pm is a deal that you are not likely to enjoy on a regular basis unless you are indeed an owl it does however merit at least one visit if you are willing to stay up late then this is a better reason than many for 300 rmb for a 4course meal plus the buyonegetone free wine selection you may forgive yourself an episodic gluttony the servings are large enough to share the selection is abundant the quality is what you would expect at this establishment i have been back with friends and family the members that are willing to forego some sleep who are looking for an affordable memorable and tasty french meal do not miss it, booked a table for 2 booking was no where to be found although many tables were available we were given a table where we would be the target of anybody passing buy took us about 20 mn to get the menu dishes ordered arrived almost cold
there are many other places in shanghai that serves better food and give a real service
the fame of mr and mrs bund is not deserved at all, the restaurant is at the top of a former bank building on the bund with incredible views of river and exciting buildings of pudong and with terraces looking over the bund this is only part of the attraction

the food is incredible very well presented and the dining room is extremely well decorated in a sophisticated blend of new that blends with the neoclassical architecture

the service is outstanding the level of enthusiasm for the wine and food was evident these people were proud to be working at this restaurant our waitress name was danny sp and she outstanding

yes the place is very expensive but worth treating yourself, very nice classy restaurant but very pricey its very popular and advance booking is required to secure a table with a view the food is delicious but the portions are small frequented by visitors and shanghai expatriates, the restaurant is amazing is very modern is in a great location  is best to reserve in advanced and ask for a table near the window to see the light show in the river  they have set menus but we decided to order a la carte must order the short rib teriyaki good enough for two people  the bread is amazing and they serve a tuna mouse that its amazing  we order the escargot and the foie gras  yum yum must go and later have a drink in the bar upstairs
i would definitely go back, i had some forewarning about how this would be and expensive meal but with uv out of reach this was how was going to get a chance to experience the master mind of paul pairet pp

i booked a table for 1 and was pleasantly surprised to get a window side seat it actually wasnt as busy as i thought it might be for a friday night

the wait staff and management were incredibly respectful and presentation of the venue is great

they took the time to walk me through and explain the menu pp specials and some of the thinking behind the dishes

i decided to go for the signature dishes 2 of which are apparently part of the uv experience

after settling they provided me with a tuna mousse and some baguette slices

post ordering i got some fresh baguette and their own sour dough both super tasty

entre i went for the french brioche with truffle and meuniere foam

main the black cod in the bag with a side order of spinach

dessert lemon  lemon tart

i enjoyed the explanation and fanfare that the dishes were presented with sometimes lone diners get a subexperience but not here i was offered some complementary chardonnay to match with my entre

the black cod in the bag is superb and the lemon and lemon tart is just on a whole other level

the wine menu is presented on an ipad with the ability to filter by region and grape i personally found the by the glass wine menu a little limited and a whole bottle isnt plausible when dining alone well theoretically a bottle of wine is a great idea but not if you want to navigate back to your hotel in one piece i opted for a chinese cabernet sauvignon

personally i would recommend mmb as a place to visit while in shanghai

price wise dishes range from 120600 cny with some slightly less and others slightly more expect about 900cny per personthis is a 5 star experience worth every penny, the bund is the most wellknown tourist destination in shanghai but unlike many such hotspots the food quality has risen to meet the demand no more so than mr and mrs on the bund where imagination and cheekiness is combined with top quality ingredients recommend the set menus for two which have terrific variety look out especially for the giant shrimp steamed in a bottle to retain all the flavours and odours word of warning this is not tapas the dishes are mediumsized and seem to get larger as the courses progress so dont gorge on the bread basket before the first dish arrives, i found this on the michelin guide and the asias top 50 list and was sorely disappointed the flavors are harsh and not subtle the images and presentation are beautiful $3000 for one jumbo shrimp wtf no wonder they recommend it the profit margins are insane the one dish i did like was the porridge and it was too salty i mentioned it to the waiter and he said that most customers say the same thing okay most customers mention it so why dont you change it im surprised they are still in business let alone on the asias top 50 list, nice location and decoration food is delicious although relatively expensive
after 23 they always have some special offers, i went for brunch with friend the restaurant has excellent views of pudong and the service is good we ordered some of their recommendations the truffle toast is fabulous with truffle foam on the top take one bite and the smell of truffle is fulfil in the mouth i think i would not recommend the teriyaki short ribs the taste of teriyaki is too strong that cover the fresh of rib and a bit salty

and at last the lemon tart is a must order i love it for the first sight im a big fan of lemon tart and its the best i ever had they make the whole lemon soak in sugar for 3 days emptied the inside and fill it with some citrus fruit grapefruit orange and pomelo a little lemon sorbet is the surprise sweet and sour you shouldnt miss it if you like lemon tart, went here after a long day of business meetings and had a great experience the cocktails were delicious and the menu was very extensive the service was very helpful and all courses were incredibly tasty on top of the great meal the view is spectacular, executive summary visited in dec16 for brunch

pros  nice ambience perfect location for views of pudong beautiful presentation decent value tasty food

cons  im not a big fan of these expatsy places but this is genuinely a very decent restaurant for brunch at least

top tip  booking is a must do it online a month before you go to secure a table

must try the smoked salmon it was one of the best inhouse smoked salmon ive ever had the truffle toast was also very special

thanks for a positive experience, the brunch we had at mmb was no way the same quality we used to get before ham cheese omlettes egg benedicte was still there so is beef carpaccio smoked salmon etc but the quality was way down comparing to other visits they were not at mmb quality but at a huge eatery quality which caters to huge amount of crowd with poor quality the service was still fine and attentive the chef should give a look at his recent quality, this restaurant is one of the best restaurants i ever tried the food is just amazing and i was offen there when i lived in shanghai if i ever go there again this will be my priority and the dessert with strawberry is amazing if you ever get the chance you should do it nice food nice view from the bund, unforgettable and memorable dinner perfect ambience attentive and proactive service welldesigned menu will want to visit again, we came there once again shanghai so short living that excellent restaurants may close only half year later because customers hype others but this one is not only very good we enjoyed our lunch very much but also still well visited and with a great view onto the bund so we will come here by time again for sure, we went here in our first night in shanghai and it was amazing we had the set menu 4 as it appeared did almost everyone lease in the restaurant the complimentary mouse with warm bread was so delicious you have to eat it within 5 minutes or it melts away
the prawn in a jar was extremely tasty and the long short rib was just perfect but the best bit was the pudding a lemon with the most amazing filling of lemon curd and cream and a delicious short bread grisini we had a bottle of rose and a bottle of still water the total bill was about <u+00a3>290 which is quite a lot but it was our first night and the quality of the food was outstanding if im ever in shanghai again i will go back, a must for a nice business dinner bund expensive but reasonable value for money taking into account the alternatives in the neighborhood
a safe shoot to take your boss
and always a good second round to move up to the roof top for bar rouge, we visited mr and mrs bund a few weeks ago for desserts after having dinner elsewhere in puxi i had heard about the signature dessert the lemon and lemon tart for a long time and really wanted to try it it did not disappoint it is amazing a candied preserved lemon is filled with layers of lemon sorbet and lemon curd served with a shortbreadtype cookie shaped like a chopstick the flavours are wonderful and i highly recommend it my friends enjoyed other desserts that were also delicious the floating island was delicious and the presentation spectacular the dark chocolate mousse was decadent and the pomelo sections with flavoured sugar and pop rocks were unique and surprising in a good way, you can�t find this place unless you know where to go since there are no signs anywhere once getting there you will have a great experience from the modern kitchen i would recommend a setmenue the food is just coming with a perfect timing it is not cheap but if you are to go for something a bit more expensive i highly recommend this place will i be back yes

peter  filip, having heard amazing things about this place it was a must on our trip yes its expensive especially the water yikes but the food is to good to miss the picnic chicken was the stand out dish for me and was worth every penny

if you can try and get a table by the window for the amazing view, this review covers multiple visits to mr  mrs bund in 2016 and early 2017

summary
when in shanghai whether to live or to visit you must come to mr  mrs bund preferably to dine but at a minimum to sit at their bar

the excellent
service is far above average for china  meeting expectations of even the top global travelers host and wait staff are multilingual attentive without being intrusive

the menu is a bit different than most youve seen they have a drink menu on an ipad and then have the 4 basic choices for tasting menus which ive always chosen and you can pair those with wine a nice and extravagant touch

they have fine choices a al carte as well but i have always had the tasting menu here

the food here is part theatre part culinarycutting edge and always delicious think scaled down version of ultraviolet ive tried each of the tasting menus and honestly with each course i havent been disappointed

note the pricing on the tastings are perperson

as noted elsewhere the views are amazing be sure to request a bund view table if you do request the view they offer 2 seatings one at 7pm and one at 900 i always prefer the later one so as not to feel rushed especially when having the tasting menus

they have a great wine and champagne list

the average
nothing about mr  mrs bund is average

pro tips
 make reservations
 request the bund view
 try the tasting menu not to be missed
 leave time for having cocktails outside when possible
 after dinner walk up the bund to the waldorf astoria they have an amazing long
bar with the best jazz in shanghai
 if you have a late seating go the bar lounge upstairs on the roof its awesome and a
bit selective about who they let in dress to impress, yes the food and view are good the local sea bass puts chiles to shame the cost of real estate is no doubt high but when they ask if evian is ok make sure you ask the price seems like gouging same at lost heaven, we didnt have a reservation for lunch and couldnt get a table with a view so we opted for drinks on the terrace it was cold outside but totally worth it the view of the bund is amazing and the jug of pimms cup was superb

we loved it and plan to come back for lunch reservation in toe, very good dishes we had a set dinner with an excellent wine french style some staff speak french oysters foi gras and the steak were excellent, when you go to shanghai one of the first places people say to try is mr  mrs bund we went for sunday brunch and was not disappointed staff were very well trained and service was smooth we each had 3 courses and 1 side dish portions were generous and i wasnt able to finish the pork ribs each dish was decadent its pricey around 1700 rmb incl 2 glasses of wine 1 small carafe wine sparkling water and cappuccino but it was worth it considering the whole ambiance and well executed dishes, we booked in advance and did not realise they did not serve weekend brunch set anymore i did check from their website  the set lunch was still present
anyway we ended up ordering 2 glasses of wine one appetiser 2 mains and 2 desserts to share the food was nice but did not worth the $ honestly with a total sum of nearly hkd1500 we would be able to enjoy a more luxurious lunch in hk

still it is a gd experience having a meal inside a historical spacious building with nice french food, for an incredibly broad menu in a whimsical and beautiful space  this is it amazing views of the pudong skyline both from the restaurant and the terrace off of the restaurant very helpful staff delicious food the breadbasket cannot be skipped  amazing, elegant stylish restaurant with gorgeous view of the shanghai skyline so ask for a window seat if you can there are also a couple of terraces for the perfect photo

the service in the restaurant was excellent and the staff had superb english food was great but not amazing

id recommend if there is a special event but still prefer hakkasan downstairs, the food was amazing usually im not impressed by fine dining food but the majority of the food served here was genuinely delicious the atmosphere is also very fancy mr and mrs bund is located on the bund and its a great locationthere is sightseeing to do around as well as other restaurants + shops the restaurant was able to accommodate our large group of around 20 people, i think foods here are very yummy clever and good portions

we enjoy our fine dining to very good restaurant around i must say this chef deserves for being famous we enjoyed so much service also very well trained

thanks for yummy foods, this place serves good food very busy and they make you concentrate on the food and your partner and not you atmosphere okay but again you are not in the center, i went there for a sunday brunch with a friend the egg benedict is fabulous i was surprised by the prices thought it was more expensive

there is only one negative thing they dont offer cheese platter which is a must have for a french brunch, the decor and atmosphere for decemberchristmas was just perfect not over the top tastefully done staff was courteous and efficient  and food was great will definitely be back again, mr  mrs bund is my favourite restaurant in china the food the common sense approach to wine and the extraordinary quality of service marks it out above its competitors it is not cheap but worth every yuan the views also are remarkable from this historic building, i went twice to mr and mrs bund
first time was for the late dinner and honestly even it is a nice idea i dont recommend it food was not amazing mush potato was too salty we couldnt eat it it is easy and basic food
as it is called you eat very late midnight and they served you very quickly

but i went back at a regular time and we took a menu 4 dishes it wasnt at all the same thing first the service they cut in front you and explained in details the dish the plates deserve michelin stars because the quality is amazing well cooked and deeply thought with delicate finishing touches the plate itself is beautiful to look and you feel that it takes a real savoir faire to do it
inside is beautiful and sophisticated you feel at your ease outside they have a small place where you can have a drink and enjoy the scenic view

for me it is the best french restaurant in shanghai and i spent 1 year there
so if you want to go there do it well and dont go with the late dinner if you cannot afford it have a drink on their terrasse it will be less expensive and you will enjoy the amazing landscape of the bund, i visited the restaurant during the new years long weekend they had a choice of a la carte and set menu i went for the a la carte the service and the food was excellent and definitely worth the price to be honest when you have decided to visit this restaurant i believe many of youus have done research already and knowing the budget

servicespeed
for me french has always been about fine dining that means a lot expensive than your average mcdonalds or pizza hut but at the same time eating without much of a rush i dont like paying for expensive food and get rush to leave the restaurant within 1hr if you want that i am very sure nearby there are bars that can do that for you therefore ive seen some people said their service needs to be improved then they surely dont know much about fine dining

food
they have excellent and wide selection of food to choose from from traditional french to fusion i had major problems when choosing what to eat when your stomach can probably only fit in 3~4 courses also the dessert is excellent

bar
theres a bar which also have a wide selection of alcohol to choose from you can sit there whilst waiting for your table i went there a bit earlier and requested a window seat therefore i had a drink or two at the bar very good

overall the service of the staff is excellent and food too well worth it, the food here ranges from acceptable to incredible you must try the french toast the only real draw back is that not all servers are allowed to take an order on our first visit we waited 40 minutes because we were told only the manager could take orders, three of us did the 2006 dom perignon tasting with fabulous fresh oysters and caviar to die for additional delicacies included boston lobster in citrus jar and melt in your mouth rib teriyaki a dining experience for all the senses and well worth the cost, it is extraordinary and exceptional because

christmas day lunch with an option to choose set meal or alacarte this reason alone gets an extra star

we now understand why they asked the age and gender of our children when we made reservations there were giant teddy bears to take home and all the kids had christmas presents under the tree barbies car tracks trains the good stuff

food is french exquisitely prepared and presented well im a sucker for eggs benedict pate escargot and hot bread i was way too full before the main course rack of lamb yes cod in bag no

this happens to be our most expensive meal in shanghai and without alcohol four times with consideration of the service decor food quality the extras and festive season this will always be a memorable meal for us and the children, i enjoyed a late dinner at mr  mrs bund which is a highly recommended restaurant on the bund the building has an intriguing multibicycle sculpture made from real bicycles starting at the ground floor and rising through the stairwell gap near the elevators i liked the postmodern feel on the floor of mr  mrs bund the door to the restaurant is large and unassuming and then i entered an excellently presented large restaurant area the appearance is great and the service great the restaurant is expensive but makes up for it with the quality and variety of food great selection of wines i took off one point though because i follow a vegan diet and found the menu lacking in providing food for me my dinner turned out to be what i think where just vegetable side dishes and i had expected better for the vegetarian options for any nonvegetarian i would give full points to this western restaurant at the best address in shanghai, we visited on xmas day as guests of freinds that were very goood freinds of management im sure our experience was very special for this reason but the food was plentiful and exceptional quality
the portions are very generous so arrive hungry

the night was faultless except for the expanded waist line, the service from start to finish the attention received and the exquisite food were just too much they even had a waiter accompany us downstairs to make sure the taxi we ordered was the correct one we felt we were treated like royalty and so did the many other diners, from the flawless reservation process to the greeting and dinner this was a perfect time at mr  mrs bund
the person who greeted us remembered that it was my sons birthday and made sure he had a cake specially made for him
the food was a feast the two dishes that really impressed us were the pissaladiere as a starter and the lemon as dessert
the wine list offers a huge selection from all over the world at every price
the view from the terrace is incredible at night
truly a memorable evening thanks","French cuisine",0.976045240971315
60,"very nice restaurant located in the kerry hotel in pudong extensive wine list with great waygu steak options, a very high class steakhouse  despite our steak was slightly overcooked it was still delicious the wine list was ok for china  the place is somewhat remotely located and in my 2 visits the ambiance was a bit down, visited here on a business trip with eight other colleagues the steak was cooked to perfection service was also high standard overall a lovely restaurant in the shanghaila hotel, this restaurant is inside the kerry hotel and as the name suggests they specialise in steaks and meat i had the filet and it was excellent cooked perfectly our waiter was friendly and helpful and pointed out a great bottle of wine for us not the cheapest place youll find but really good food, i would like to give 5 stars but my steak was overdone it was an expensive cut but i didnt have time to get a new one cooked and then eat it so i put up with it fantastic red wine too, been here three times over the past 6 months and the food is always great we tend to order a few starters and share as they are a good size the chorizo in particular the chateaubriand is superb and both the garlic chips and macaroni cheese sides are very good

as other reviewers have mentioned the service can be a little haphazard and it is pricey for what is basically a steak restaurant but great setting and atmosphere, very nice restorant quality of food very good price medium high im eat king smoke salmon and crab salad, absolutely a place to visit and enjoy the best meat in shanghai ever green salad are really suggested good wine list the even produce beer who can be tested, i am from singapore this is one of the most wonderful restaurant i have ever been to i never taste they serves the best food the steakcrab cake are so delicious the restaurant environment is very clean and tidy i am honored to know the manager benjamin zhong i heard he also have the singapore background i feel very kind he is very friendly to us to introduce the knowledge of wine and the culture of shanghaii will go there next time, now this restaurant has excellent food  really really tasty the staff are very friendly warm and kind however the service is terrible  it is so slow we waited so long between each course and to get attention from a waiter they just were not efficient enough and this was quite disappointing and put a negative feel on our night it is disappointing since the food and wine was actually really good, i was lucky enough to win sunday brunch at the meat for 4 in a raffle ive had a few shanghai brunches and this falls at the civilised end good buffet starter heavy on seafood main from menu  a very good if small steak buffet puds which were a bit depleted by the time we got that far free flow beer ipa and pils from the brew house wine and fresh juice all very good if not as opulent as shanghai residents might have come to expect at 350rmb not bad value, shanghai for steaks yes the meat at kerry hotel is simply just that  great steaks its done the us double broil style served with very complementary accompaniments and sides  sauteed mushrooms truffle fries macncheese the starters were excellent  had the chizo spiced sausages lobster cake and salad the desserts were a nice ending note to the fantastic dinner  ice cream served in lollipops service was good but needs to be a little more polished for a restaurant at this level  cutlery and plate change was abrupt and lacks grace, had a really fun night actually ate in the brew pub but ordered from the meat i got the tomahawk it was huge but really good the beer is good here too it was a ton of fun, we invited customers for dinner because of its high rating the venue is actually very nice the dinner was somehow not matching our expectations nice variety of cuts and sizes in the menu unfortunately average meat quality not cooked to perfection rare medium rare and medium were all the same not worth the prices, great place to have dinner i recommend both steak and sea food really good wine
should ask for the desserts amazing, amazing seafood platter incredibly fresh and the steak was cooked exactly the way i wanted with the cherry sauce hmmmmm indeed a nice place to dine, my fillet mignon was cooked exactly like i ordered it every bite was delightful it was a little expensive but worth it they offer to take you back to the kitchen and let you see the oven i did this and really liked seeing the natural cherry wood they were burning to cook with i also ordered a large bottle of sparkling water and had a relatively small glass i was very impressed that they could keep the glass from becoming empty very attentive service, try the meat at kerry hotel and one of the best steak house in shanghai and the best in their menu is ningaloo tomahawk this steak aged for 21 days in dry aging room and portion was awesome and they will cut the steak infront of your table and also a lot of very nice wine to pair with this steak the service was very attentive and the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and always smiling when you talking to them this restaurant was quite far from the city center but you will never regret and you will comeback again to try the other dishes, good menu amazing steak well prepare and cooked congrats to the staff we felt welcome and well take care, read reviews of this place and went there as i thought it was halal meats however the staff are clueless about halal if youre a muslim  suggest to wait until they have a certification or someone can really confirmed reviewing here for the owners of the sheraton to validate with info, i love the decor and the view is really fabulous we went for dinner they served best meat in town nice quality good taste and fresh food you will enjoy the foods and the great attention sevice by joses team, good quality steak but limited menu cooking is no big deal but steaks done perfectly wine list is good and totally enjoyable evening but expensive, enjoyed a nice evening with friends here weekend but not really crowded took us awhile to get there taxi or metro since we live on the puxi side service was good as you would expect at this price level nice to be able to have a look at the meat storage directly and option to see your meal being prepared though we did not do that the steaks were pretty good mortons is still better but also much more pricy overall good balance of cost quality and service just well a bit far away, we were a party of 6 and we ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion in a nice looking place however when some of the ladies asked for warm water we were told not available as waitress was pushing imported mineral water when asked why we were told that this is a hiclass establishment which only serves the best we also preferred dark bread to white and we were told it is not being served which started it irritate us after putting the champagne on hold and talking to the manager they entertained that requests
overall food was ok put for that price you expect more ie that doneness of the meat ordered would be as ordered and we really did not appreciate the waitress to argue with us what the difference between medium and medium rare is the restaurant was unorganised and the service well below what you expect from a shangrila hotel overall a disappointment, been in this restaurant last week nice environment the service friendly and high level the food very interesting and nice little bit expensive but fine
i will be back for sure in the next trip, easter sundays brunch was naturally a busy time for the kerry hotel pudong the meat restaurant on the second floor was a popular choice fully booked out it is a small well fittedout restaurant a pleasant surprise in a 5 star international hotel they offered a partal a carte part buffet dining package for easter 2015

the wide choice of entree appetisers could easily take the place of the main course salads complemented the lobster bisque and a wide selection of cold meats and seafood baskets of small buns accompanied by several interesting toppings were placed on the table to start the meal

for drinks there was a good variety of freshly made fruit juices such as watermelon celery carrotorange the french red was a reasonable lunch wine the white was only average we didnt have room to sample the homebrew beers although seeing at the brewery vats in use at one end of the restaurant was interesting

there were around 10 mains including some seafood and vegetarian dishes to choose from the imported australian angus beef and lamb were terrific each steak was perfectly cooked to cover for our individual requirements the children at our table were happy with their smaller size mains such as hamburgers and chips

everyone struggled to finish their mains even though there was a nice choice of deserts to follow for once the coffee in a hotel restaurant was actually as good as my freshly ground illy coffees in the mornings remarkable

the hospitality from the restaurant manager zeke and his team was excellent at all times there were no communication problems service was delivered professionally and quickly perhaps a small downside was their sales promotion of extra dishes and beverages such as easter eggs and wines par for the course in most 5 star hotel restaurants though

overall the meat is one of the best restaurants in pudong great food its expensive but should be considered for those special occasions for small groups families and couples, the location isnt that good where is a bit far from the city center but i have to say its one of the best steakhouses in shanghai
excellent or dinner cocktail the meat th wine list and the service were outstanding as well as the vibes in the restaurant
we will come back for another business dinner, all kind of meat excellent offer and choices
we enjoyed a splendid meat and a nice italian wine
presentation and service was very good, i had read about the meat often showed wrongly as the meet in various searches and wanted to try it out for the experience i had decided to go for the signature ningaloo tomahawk as well as the madeatyour table cesar salad

arriving it took a couple of minutes to get the attention of a waiter but my booked table was exactly as i had requested and we got a nice window place booth  the waiter was very pleasant and smiling providing right away menus and drink cards as well as a snack
i hesitated a little to order the ningaloo tomahawk as it had gone from the rmb 900 i had seen to almost rmb 1300  but i had earmarked some money for this so i went ahead and with my dinnerdate ordered the main course the cesar salad side dishes as well as a very nice 2010 chianti which i must say was very reasonably priced and some mineral water
i was a bit disappointed that no side dishes was included with the ningaloo tomahawk but had to be added at rmb 50 a choice

while waiting for the cesar salad we received some very nice bread along with different butters and dippings that made for a nice start the cesar salad is made a the table for a bit of show  nice enough but not really worth the price tag of rmb 100
the bread and salad is a good way to kill time until the ningaloo tomahawk arrives  it takes a bit of time so everyone was good and hungry when the waiter rolled in the meat and carved it up at the table
i have to say it was fantastic meat  cooked to specification tender full of flavour and perfect serving temperature if you love your meat each mouthful was a pleasure the great taste here could almost warrant a rating of four but only almost  i would say it overall was average in experience and overpriced but the meat was fantastic
the side dishes was a bit small but i will admit to the servings of mashed potatoes was heavenly  clearly the chef knows to use plenty of butter to make this dish

service was ok during the entire meal  glasses were refilled whenever a waiter came by but between courses there was not a waiter to be seen but i will have to say that the staff was very friendly and smiling when they were present
the spectacle of the cesar salad being made at the table as well as the ningaloo tomahawk being cut out was not an overwhelming or spectacular experience  i have had meat cut at the table many times in many parts of the world

with a pricetag of rmb 2300 for 2 persons which included a cesars salad a ningaloo tomahawk 2 bottles of mineral water a bottle of chianti and 3 side dishes i was left feeling a bit underwhelmed at the end the service is nowhere near the level where the addition of a 15 service fee is warranted i have experienced much better elsewhere for less money and although this is clearly a highprice restaurant i was not at any point convinced that it should be that expensive by the decor the service or anything else

perhaps my expectations were too high  i would say that the meat certainly delivered on the taste experience of the ningaloo tomahawk but i did not feel i got full value for my money at that price tag, i regularly go to the meat during my stay at the kerry in pudong it is probably the best steak restaurant in shanghai the decoration is nice the staff was again very attentive and friendly the restaurant is very popular therefore a reservation is highly rcommended
i went for a lobster soup as a starter and a medium rare rib eye steak the steak was perfectly prepared
if you want a brilliant classical piece if beef dont miss the meat at the kerry pudong hotel, returned here during my return stay at kerry the restaurant is busy as usual the warm bread is good as always skipped the starter and went straight for the australian sirlion there are many more expensive cuts in the menu but the sirlion suffices in fact it is very good they also now show an entire trolley of condiments to go with your meat unfortunately the side of peas i ordered was only soso

throughout the meal 5 different staff asked about the food which i think is good service

overall great place for steak and the service is excellent, i stayed in the kerry hotel in the beginning of september and ate at the meat twice the first night we all had a super meal i had a beautiful fillet of beefthe staff were good and the resteraunt in nicely decoratedthe second night two of us had serlion steaks and we couldnt eat them as they were so fattyi spoke to the manager and he said he would not charge for the stakesi paid and left for the airport when i checked the bill later to find only one stake was credited, pros
 decor and atmosphere great modern decoration with a great atmosphere beautiful people great spot for a business dinner or a group friends
 servicestaff super efficient and fully attention to the customers everything went perfect on this regards staff very friendly and helpfull good english speakers
 food quality great meat well cooked
 is not cheap but this is not a ordinary steakhouse it<u+00b4>s a top end restaurant so the price is accordant to what you get

cons
nothing in particular on negative side

do i will return
for sure yes, i ordered my ribeye medium rarei thought i was chewing beef jerky i sent it backand then i seen a small chef meandering out in the dining roomhe looked angryi think he was the chief chef otherwise service was very good, i ate twice at this restaurant at the kerry hotel  once for dinner where i had a very good steak and once for buffet sunday lunch where i ate rack of lamb on both occasions the meat was very tender and good quality it is not cheap however and i did feel it was overpriced especially as for the dinner there were no side dishes included in the price and i had to order these extra, the restaurant offers excellent meat cooked to the perfection

i had the tbone once and the filet mignon another time they were both awesome

the staff is nice though signals you a bit directly 15min before closure at 1030 pm

note that the restaurant is only open for dinner not for lunch, our family is on our 4th year here as expats in shanghai weve had our share of excellent restaurants and the bad and tonight was the first time weve eaten at the meat for the price the service was extremely lackluster and the meal was totally underwhelming

we ordered the lobster bisque for an appetizer a small bowl for 78 rmb the taste of lobster was there but the soup was thin runny and diluted i had to search for the 2 tiny pieces of lobster i found in the bowl

the sides to share averaged at 50 rmbside we ordered seasonal vegetables and received a small ramekin of mixed vegetables the vegetables were in a heavily salted butter sauce and not enough for 2 to share

my husband ordered the ribeye and i ordered the sirloin both cooked to medium as we asked while our cuts of beef were good neither were seasoned with salt or pepper each plate had a green tumbler of brown sauce for dipping my sauce was appropriately peppery but tepid in temperature the three little grilled tomatoes on the plate had more flavor than the steak and sauce combined

at just under 1000 rmb it was the most expensive disappointing dinner weve had in shanghai in a long time the only thing we enjoyed was the pot of rose tea and my glass of malbec save your time and money and go elsewhere

i highly recommend either mortons the steakhouse in ifc mall or my personal favorite char bar  grill on the top of hotel indigo located on the bund both serve fantastic beef excellent meals from appetizer to dessert have attentive service and a view to make the night special, had a family sunday brunch at the meat
we have done this several times before and always enjoyed
the started table is plenty to start the day particularly enjoyed the cold cuts and smoked salmon

the main courses were good as always the 50rmb extra for the bigger steak was worth it i tried the breakfast and really enjoyed the meal the salmon was overcooked last time if was undercooked

the ice cream dessert was different to our previous visits the pistachio ice cream element seems to have been replaced by a pot of cream we asked about the ice cream but with no success

did not leave enough room for the cheeses maybe next time

not as good as our previous visits but the ipa beer made up for it, went with friends for brunch the starter appetizer buffet was small selection but good quality items which we enjoyed especially the raclette cheese iberico ham smoked salmon amongst others freshly squeezed juices two types of ice tea craft beer dessert buffet offered a variety of choices then a la carte orders of soup n main course we all ordered the wagyu sirloin which we were all disappointed up but the ningaloo on the trolley made up for the shortfall the ice cream had too much cream on top of the ice cream which turned off kids and adults alike also interesting for families with kids is the 2 hours free play at the adventure zone all in all a pretty nice day for everyone, went with my wife and had a delightful dining experience weve been in the past and it is always a pleasure, there are two places we go for a great steak in shanghai the meat is always consistent with food and their service the atmosphere is nice and it is a in a very convenient location at kerry parkside, we were a group of 6 we shared salads and then ordered some steaks 6 difference different cooking and different sauce at the end there were some mistakes and 2 of us get the wrong steak cooking plus once the food arrived on the table the waiter served 4 of us and rushed to another table to serve the bread without finishing serving us so we had to ask him to finish the service in a strong way plus it took them several minutes to bring the salt and pepper despite asking several times overall the food was very tasty the salads and the side dishes were also delicious but for such price we expected better attention on the service the restaurant was super busy so they need to adapt or refuse customers or delay the booking by 15 minutes between each tableagain so busy that the restaurant was super noisy difficult to carry on conversation between 6 people their wine selection is interesting but on the high price
i recommend anyway this restaurant for the savor and tenderness of the meat even if i would have prefer a more cosy atmosphere in my side, stayed at the hotel and wanted to try this steakhouse since there isnt one in the mall next door

we got a window seat but it wasnt a big deal since we were on the 2nd floor its better than the tables in the middle of the room though

contrary to the strange review by a previous reviewer this place is packed on a wednesday night

we started with the blue cheese salad and it was delicious i saw the next table having their caesar salad prepared tableside with the giant parmesean bowl and it looked good too

we ordered their standard sirloin though there are 100 more and more expensive options we just wanted some protein and didnt care for the rmb900 premium steaks ours turned out to be delicious i can only imagine how the more expensive ones taste

we ordered a chianti and bordeax and both were good the room has a voucher for a free glass of wine so that came in handy

service was good overall and probably trained to the shangrila stamdard

overall expensive but worth the trip if you are craving a good steak, pretty pricey though but the steaks sauces and side dishes are really good make sure you book one of the booth at the windows they can seat up to six and have enough privacy, my partner and i visited this restaurant as part of the shanghai restaurant week deal and we both agreed that it was the worst of all the 4 places that we visited that week

whereas other restaurants understood that restaurant week is about gaining new customers perhaps showcasing some of the courses that make you popular trying out new dishes etc it seemed like the meet didnt want to be left out of pocket and so designed a 3 course set menu for 250rmb which would actually cost this price normally in any other restaurant there was no wow factor

for starters the choices were both a salad really you think you can win people over with a salad i was gobsmacked this really highlighted that they had missed the mark of what people expect at another restaurant for example we were given an amuse bouche small pasta dish small pizza ricotta and strawberry with toasted bread all for starters

the main course was slightly better  the choice between ribs or lamb my partners ribs were full of gristle and the quality was just so poor if the waitress had spoken more english then we would have mentioned something to her about this the lamb was ok but there wasnt much of it

the dessert of chocolate fondant was very good but it wasnt exactly memorable again other restaurants during this week were pulling out all the stops with creating unique and extravagant dishes but this was a simple chocolate dessert which you can get in any other restaurant

the atmosphere was awful despite all other restaurants being absolutely packed during restaurant week when we visited the meet there was a total of 4 tables being used it was therefore dull and quiet and the waitresses lined up facing our table so we felt like our every move was being watched i understand that they thought they were being helpful and could rush over whenever we needed something but it was horrible as we felt like they were watching for our reactions watching us talk watching how we ate something it wasnt exactly relaxing

we wont be visiting the meet again nor will we recommend it to our friends in shanghai if you visit the other restaurants at this hotel you will soon realise that the quality of food and the service is well below par when compared to other shangrila hotels, only eat here if you are staying at the kerry the dining room is cosy and the wine selection is excellent, if you like good food great service and a fantastic atmosphere  you have found it, nice ambiance wide variety of food asian to western with their own food stands average taste of food though many options but not tasty, we had a formal dinner here with our customers who did not want to eat chinese food and we were not disappointed the steaks were perfectly cooked and enormous the choice of wines was excellent in fact the restaurant was so good that i will probably stay at the kerry hotel next time i am in shanghai as it is good food and also very convenient for the sniec venue next door, we were attracted to this restaurant by a description that it was fun and hip what we discovered was that it was like any restaurant we had ever seen in bethesda maryland  if thats what you like you will enjoy the meet otherwise there is way too much to see and enjoy in downtown shanghai that to take the trip out to pudong the kerry hotel seemed lovely huge and very vibrant probably very comfortable","sport bar",0.554333036344127
61,"i walked around and just like that atmosphere so i come back for lunch i order beef which one so soft and really delicious just sauce maybe for me too strong they have really big offer of desserts you can see all of them and choose whats really not easy i have to definitely come back soon for try another dessert service was helpful and help me choose the best for me one what i forget is bread what they bake there its simply but amazing, we have not been there for business dinner in the past 6 months due to a bad experience
the recent visit was not much better partly their lack of training and organisation  partly not their short coming

no language problem when ordering however the staff was not carefully checking when asking for allergic contents so one of our guest left sick great we try to finish the main clirse the filet steak was not as ordered cooked one slice was burned up to 5mm  once complained they told me its well done great the food overall was good no doubt but on such price levels care and attention to details is of the essence

the second part unpleasant was a large group of american business men noisy and unconsiderate to anyone else in the restaurant many people complained when leaving not their fault but a clash of cultures, went to the villa for dinner with my wife
loved the food  we were really full in the end which changes from gastro restaurant where you are usually still hungry in the end the portion were really fair
the beef cheeks were delicious  best ever 
and my wife adored the scallops in there lobster sauce
service was really good smiling staff and overall good feeling
the only 2 negative point for me was 
first  the fact that we were in between 2 other tables really next to us and that there wasnt any privacywe were able to listen each table conversation which was not really comfortable for my point of view
so i recommend that you ask for a private table when you book if you are looking for that
second  the price of the desserts  80 rmb for the size of the dessert the value for money was not as good as the rest of the meal, we reserved a table at bistrot 321 le bec and got a table in front of the aquarium which was freezing cold we asked for another table which took almost 25 minutes they offered drinks for free to compensate we had to wait at the bar but when we received the bill they charged for the drinks when we complained they said that nobody offered the drinks due to the changing of tables they mixed our coats when i give my number of my coat they told me very unfriendly its over there when i told them that i was disappointed they said thanks you see you next time that will not be the case, the place is amazing it is a colonial house extremely well decorated with many different ambiences the quantities are large be careful with ordering the quality of foie pate and cheese is extremely high main courses were really excellent we order steak tartare and several lamb shanks and the satisfaction was general everything extremely good staff is helpful and kind and there is a very nice bar in the upper floor a magnificent esperienceand if you think it is outrageously expensive it is not you can take away your foie also, good french restaurant there are some specialities which really deserve tonne tasted the maki being probably the one i be enjoyed the most main course was great and deserts are gorgeous wine list is also quite generous, this is a great restaurant food and service is very good the price was ok we were pleased excelent staffs, i cant imagine the french cuisine in shanghai caused i have no experience before  i was recommended by my friend  a foreigner living in shanghai he told to try the best french cuisine restaurant in shanghai the looking of the restaurant was extremely attractive  as well as inside also the same the sommielere was a foreigner as well the starter  french bread  was amazing  oysters were fresh  main course we selected the beef were outstanding both looking and tasting , i have spent over a year in shanghai and this restaurant was for sure the best french restaurant i have done with mr and mrs bund so far
it is expensive but totally worth it dishes were just perfect in terms of quality quantity and design they propose a wide menu with typical french food and wine
go there for sure you wont be disappointed
i recommend to go during summertime because they have nice outdoor space, 7 of us for dinner as we had friends flying in it was quite late by shanghai standards anyway we seated at our table about 830pm

the waitstaff all very friendly and efficient we had plenty to drink and the food was excellent

of the more outstanding was the kg bone in wagyu prim rib i think that what it was and the 500gm sirloin both cooked to perfection, i can say that for me it is a number one place when i am carving for real french food great ambience food service favorite dishes are pate en croute escargot truffled brie steak tartare pork rillette and etc the best place to experience appetizers and cocktails when it comes to main courses better be careful with what you get some of dishes are not what you expect like crispy pork feet
still my favorite place for food and spending time in a garden highly recommended
service is good but sometime can be a little pretentious oh well nobody is perfect, i took my wife here to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary the restaurant is housed in a classic and historic villa house so the atmosphere can be quite romantic and intimate as the restaurant is spread throughout its many rooms we started with escargots and foie gras we then had fish and beef entrees with sides of potatoes and string beans all dishes were flavorful and exquisitely preparedpresented the sommelier paired each course with wines which were perfectly matched the patrons were both expat and chinese which made for a nice atmosphere it was our first time dining here and we will make return visits for sure, we had a very nice business dinner in le bec various choices of more and lesse tyical french dishes high quality food and very attentive and friendly service the atmosphere in this old villa is great prices are on the upper scale but for shanghai really ok, the chili cranberry sauce we had with their special cheese was excellent we even continued having the main meat course with the sauce as well great beautiful place and ambience, we had a lovely dinner with my wife for our wedding anniversary very nice place with a very good service and the beef tartareawesome, we had a lovely dinner with another couple we were sitting in the green house in the back the restaurant is a big villa with different types of rooms you have the bistrot in the front upstairs is more formal dining and they have in the back a green house and a garden we loved the location
the food was good not over sophisticated which i like great wine selection and good service this is definitely a place to go in shanghai for a nice evening, we arrive a little early and ask for open our own bottle of wine we bring  smoky area bar inside de   outside to hot  so no where to wait properly for be comfortable  when table be ready they put us in bistro side  smaller table than the other room  bad communication for the follow of the wine we have in aperitif and the bottle of water disappear  the french manager his very helpful but cant deal with everything  maybe more train for the staff will help him a lot  food was good for the starters to share  main course and side dish so so and very expensive  the second bottle of wine we take was ok  i m not sure i will back again  popularity his one think but also you need to show it  paying this price i prefer to wait to go in michelin star restaurant around the world and you know why you pay  of course no view , this restaurant is on a charming treelined street it was just down the street from my hotel and that is great you want to spend as little time outside in shanghai as possible because the air quality is abysmal

i really really liked this place i had the cold tomato soup sort of a gazpacho it was nice but nothing too special however the wagayu beef filet with mushroom sauce was amazing i still dream about it i would go back again and again just for that dish

they are quite famous for their mashed potatoes and they are certainly very buttery and creamy

my colleague got the lamb shank  he did it was okay but nothing special he also got the endive salad which was enormous definitely fit for two peoplei tasted it and it was great

highly recommended, the chef have a michelin on his shoulder food was great comfort food garden nice steaks are good the home made pate are great same goes to the desserts will be back for more, sitting in the garden in spring is a great experience i love clams in soup fried frog legs beef tartar amazing steaks one of the most interesting wine lists in shanghai, great food and service the location is nice downtown old shanghai  steak was very good and also chice of wine was nice  not cheap but worth the money i must say  we really enjoyed it and we will certainly come back, if you want to eat real french food in shanghai go here  food are great  service a nice  ambiance simple but comfortable  must go , i came here for dinner with my partner and his colleague for the first time and found the whole experience from the service to food to atmosphere really lovely
i returned a couple of months later for my birthday dinner with a friend it was a last minute decision and we showed up close to 10pm again the food service and atmosphere was so lovely we both had a great night eating and drinking too much
since then i have returned twice and find the food consistently good it has become one of my favorite restaurants in shanghai and definitely recommend it, kitchen opens at 6 pm was nice steak good service
great atmospheer not very cheap but worth the price would recomand it for fancy dinner, my wife and i decided to try out this place that serves french cuisine it was a recommendation from a friend who has been there and the feedback was good enough to entice us to give it a try

service great all the way from reception to taking orders and serving

food we had the frog legs escargots asparagus boneless pig trotter and a wagyu they were all great frog legs were deep fried and a decent surprise on how it was served crusty on the outside and juicy in the inside escargots were great when it was stuffed in a small little bread piece another pleasant sure use indeed the wagyu was ok and juicy but we asked for medium when it arrived we are if the opinion that it was mediumwell done instead a bit of disappointment there asparagus was fresh with the right sauce topping

location on a busy street do not drive and take a cab it is easier

price tag not cheap but it is worth a try if you have some extra dollars on a decent meal in shanghai

smoking  it was raining on the night when we were there hence there were smokers standing in the back door puffing away that caused a polluted scent at nearby tables not sure why the waiters did not advise the smokers to move away despite the fact that it is supposed to be a nonsmoking environment

overall recommended for a try if you do not know what to have, second visit and second time disappointing 3 bland eggs for 240 rmb supposedly with truffles but no trace of the taste inquired with the staff who said it is truffle juice not truffles who ever heard of truffle juice this dish is dishonest rest was good but way too expensive for the quality staff was bice except fir chinese waitress bot surprisingly exhibiting no smile at all, reading some reviews we were worried but luckily the staff were very friendly food was very good especially chocolate mousse and foie gras starter

bill for 4 was 2500 incl wine, its a lovely villa with old shanghai architecture thats about it theres many sections in the villa and the decor varies greatly its clear how they section their customers  the less glamour end in the kitchen sits all locals including upstairs the more elegant side of the villa after which ive requested to change seats are full of foreigners and thats where they direct them when they first come in they dont give you the option to where to sit only did i venture out to look around did i demand to sit in the other zone enough said  you can make your own judgement at rmb 500+ per head for lunch i have certain expectations the plates are chipped and the food is underwhelming the scallops was the menu of the day and its not at all impressive i had the lamb it came in a drumstick which is fine but it doesnt taste like lamb and its god awful dry the manager was nice enough to inquire about the food as per protocol i told her its disappointing and she asked to remove my plate eaten two bites only to show the kitchen staff afterwards she didnt follow up to either admit the food was bad or could have at least insisted that its simply their normal standard she took away the food and that was it and then charged me the full price afterwards without saying a word i might have been more forgiving in any other restaurants but not at this price range i find it unprofessional unforgiving and appalling

it is very upsetting especially i took my mum here for mothers day lunch this is a restaurant that is superficial and pretentious  looks good on the outset but when it comes down to service and quality of food  they have a long way to go from the price they asked for

dont bother theres plenty of other good decent restaurants in shanghai i might be more forgiving with the lamb if they had acted more professionally in terms of service either apologise or admit it or offer free coffee anything at all but dont take the food away and hide behind the counter and charge me full price man up its simple courtesy, food is ok ingredients are fresh though it is not a gastro restaurant and therefore is overpriced count over 100� per person with wine the waitress told us we needed some sides but there were already some with our main dish so we ended up with a doggy bag and no more room for dessert codfish had 3 big bones inside we told the waitress to give feedback to the chef and answer was that being a fish ot is normal to find bones shame lots of french find it a fancy place but eventhough we are french we find it is not worth the money, came across this bistrot one saturday afternoon and gave it a try really was a great surprise

great indoor and outdoor seating nice table setting service is of very high standard good english levels and a very professional hands on french manager running the floor

food is fantastic especially the beef sauces breads made to perfection

not cheap but offers good value for money

will be back look forward to trying the other dishes and wines from the impressive wine list, in addition to the beautiful exterior lovely garden seating and charming indoor seating the food here was fantastic and the prices were very reasonable i highly recommend the piscine de rose for a drink rose flavored syrup and ice cubes as well as the wagyu filet de boeuf and profiteroles des escargots, have eaten at this amazing restaurant at least 15 times and that is saying something in shanghai where a new joint opens every other week a little on the pricey side but worth every cent insane wine selection food always cooked to perfection, wow what a great restaurant food is superbly french and our waitress was wonderful put a smile on our faces we had not booked and had a little wait until a table came free in the lounge upstairs restaurant was full and certainly hints at its local popularity would undoubtedly come back on our next visit to shanghai, lets start with a tip book a table for late dinner so youre not in rush and time limited to enjoy great food and wine before the dinner dont miss to have a drink at hidden garden which is nice surprize wile beeing first time here all well organized for perfection, its totally unacceptable that a restaurant which want to be high end with good service oblige its customer to take booking at 1800 and use a time to finish their meal so that it can go for a second round of booking at 2000  i will never go again , its feels really like france the rib eye was good the profiteroles with escargot delicious the service was very nice and the explain every item of the menu clearly the wine menu have a good selection but only french wines, everything was perfect food drinks service we went there for the second time two dining rooms two atmospheresboth nice and cosy suggestion for improvement  small appetizer with aperitif, we have now used this restaurant three times and on two of these occasions we have been let down by our reservation not being honoured in that we were offered an entirely different table from what we had specifically asked for and had been confirmed only a degree of dogged persistence on our behalf has ensured we were given an acceptable table this restaurant seems to have grown a reputation for this type of behaviour i think the table staff are great the place is beautiful the food is good but the managementownership sucks im afraid with the result that your evening can be a bit of a lottery last time and i mean that as we were leaving we were falsely accused of stealing some boxed ceramic knives from reception this resulted in an extremely unpleasant and aggressive confrontation with the owner whose career in the diplomatic corps obviously failed to take off even after it was established that his accusation was baseless there was no apology au revoir le bec, have stayed at the crowne plaza many times but never ventured in this direction for a restaurant so thank you trip advisor for pointing me in right direction
excellent little restaurant good atmosphere friendly efficient trilingual staff impressive wine list and superb food the spaghetti with caviar and clams was just perfect serving starters in jam jars was a bit quirky and one wondered how fresh they were but they tasted great, the food is definitely good we were there for lunch but the tables are really small giving it a cramped feeling it is quite expensive too, nicolas lebec is an impressive chef every time i went to this restaurant i took the same dish for start le pate en croute and never the quality has changed sometimes a little too crowded but what a great atmosphear the wine list is extensive with all prices the service is great they have many french staffs, an annoying start to the evening when the were not happy about sitting us where we had requested on booking and had agreed to but that was nothing to how badly the evening ended on leaving the restaurant we picked up some matches from reception desk and looked at some knives the had on sale as we left the restaurant the chef came rushing after us shouting we had stolen his knives we were shocked at the accusation and were embarrassed when the wanted to check our handbags none of then large enough to have hidden an knife the chefowner was rude but obviously eventually realised his mistake however there was no apology
so in between these two situations the food was good although foie gras pate so cold i could barely get my knife into it service was excellent and the wine waitress was very good however the evening was marred by the allegations and rudness of the owner and will certainly never return, first time visit with friends pity we had to wait in the cold hallway till our table was ready also a surprise that the place is packed with tables leaving 10 centimeters between each table good when you want to listen in to the table next to you overall the food was good and a good wine selection some starters are served in jars and would be nice if they open it makes it look less prefab overall size of the portions is large so i suggest to order 3 if you are with 4 and share we didnt so no room for dessert and we believe we missed out because they looked great the place is not cheap compared to quality so a bit pretentious, ive eaten at both villa le bec and bistrot 321 in the past and have been impressed with the food but after a recent visit i would caution against assuming that your booking will be honored

in my case i arrived with my guests in accordance with my booking only to be shown upstairs to the bar there was no room there  it was full of others waiting for their tables some were complaining that they had been waiting for 40 minutes it was clear that the staff were unwilling to encourage diners from the earlier sitting to leave and that they could give us no indication of how long we would have to wait for our table

after waiting 25 minutes we gave up my guests were getting hungry and i was beginning to find the situation embarrassing

at no stage were we offered an apology for the poor service and failure to meet our booking i would encourage the restaurant to train staff to avoid such situations and to offer some kind of recompense should they occur a free drink at the bar whilst we waited would have gone some way to ease the embarrassment, if you are looking for a french restaurant to indulge yourself with very tasty traditional dishes this is the place to go very efficient and professional services warm atmosphere making you feel in france and excellent dishes all very tasty we ordered lobster bisque rillettes tuna tartar osso bucco blanquette style and all dishes were great desserts are homemade and the most difficult part is to choose which one to order prices are relatively high but aligned with the overall offer you cant expect this quality without high prices so good value for money we paid around 600 rmb per person for 3 courses a la carte and a glass of wine well definitely be back, one of the best restaurant in shanghai the food is amazing cooked by nicolas le bec himself service is professional and friendly, amazing place and cuisine the chef is really nice and want to give his best all the food was great dont forget to keep some space for the desserts which are just perfect a lovely piece of france in shanghai, the cuisine and service is high standard and impeccable it is ridiculously expensive and does feel a little pretentious but that speaks more of shanghai itself than the restaurant overall a good choice for a special occasion or just a satisfying dining experience, we came to this place for our family christmas lunch with high expectations as many in the french expat community in shanghai had spoken in extremely positive terms i can confidently say that reality was clearly above expectations and reminded me of my childhood years in france i am half french myself

superb french bistrot food on par with the best in france period no please bear in mind were in shanghai not in france excuses perfection many difficulttofind even in france these days grandmother recipes cooked to perfection and tasting delicious

the best bistrot a table ive tasted in asia ive been 10 years in this part of the world and easily on par with the top paris and lyons bistrots

excellent pate en croute with a real oldstyle croute not the bland flaky easytoconcoct pastry substitute you find in so many places oozing with natural gelatine the way it should be

great rillettes with tiny bits of carrots the way grandma would cook it back in the village immensely good beef cheek joue de boeuf with thickly sliced carrots just once again as grandma would prepare it for the kids it transported me 40 years back

and the tour de force continues incredibly good and creative beef tartar superb bisque de homard excellent fondant au chocolat even if i found the savory section of the menu being better in execution than the sweet finales

2 small points of attention fries were good without being great and pate en croute and truffled brie cheese serving temperature was a bit cold they would taste even better if they were at room temperature

good wine list a real wine list at that not just your wine distributors catalog as it happens at so many places in shanghai

my only remark to the local and asian clientele would be that whats served is the real thing not softenedup versions adapted to the local taste maybe some customers might find some of the classical concoctions a bit too rich for the asian taste

hearty congratulations to nicolas le bec officiating in the kitchen on christmas day and magali leading the team in the beautiful conservatory dining room one of the best christmas meals ever, fabulous high end french bistrot food in a rather cramped seating environment the entrecote steak with bone marrow for two cooked to perfection saw a pate en croute on my neighbors table that i will definitely try on my next visit not for folks on a tight budget","steakhouse",0.659317316648446
62,"the pizzas are the real deal make a reservation if youre lucky you will get a free prosecco and lemon cello, this is a lovely restaurantit has the real trattoria feelvery nice ambiencethe staff is greatthey are very friendly and efficientthe menu has a good variety of appetizers pasta and rice dishesgood desserts toothe pizzas are goodone of the best i have had in china, it was so funny to find an italian restaurant in the core of shanghai able to cook a better pizza than in most of restaurant in italy
i love this restaurant because you can breathe the italian smell being seat in one of their tables in addition you can find a good selection of italian wines and beers
good place to spend an amazing dinner testing italian food, service atmosphere value food all keep me coming back well done this is a real italian vibe and offers well priced options at lunch and dinner, the location is easier than other bella napoli and room more modern but less characteristic
the menu offers all the choice of italian pastarice good both pasta carbonara and rice with seafood pizzas and main course
i suggest to order immediately the focaccia and the bruschetta to start quickly waiting the courses, its like to be in italy we had good food environment and service very good good value for money for sure i will go back again, bella napoli is a classic in shanghai it has been opened for many years the food is good the service is efficient and the atmosphere is really nice lunch sets are very good value, always a good sign when you see a large group of italians waiting outside of an italian restaurant in a city outside of italy the pizza was as good as any weve had in italythin crust with proper cheese prepared in proper napoli wood burning oven you can tell they care waitress  a lovely english speaking italianmexican young lady couldnt have been nicer we just loved bella napoli and the exhuberant chef because it felt like being with a big family we were here for new years eve meal arriving around 830 had a reservation and left well before midnight there was a musician playing songs and people burst into song for stand by me after a request from table 12 for the chef to belt out o solo mio great draft beer and nice wine selection husband had pasta and he said it was good pizza was great, the ambient is perfect to provide italian taste chequered tablecloth pictures from naples
pizza is good but a little bit to thick good also the various kinds of pasta, place is busy food is overrated last visit was very confusing food quality went down pizza 2 of them just average with very soggy crust cold cut platter has nothing special including locally made charcuterie not authentic italian servers are so confused to bring wrong food to your table so you have to recall your own order a year back it was much better, like many foreigners resident in china our business and frequent night time calls with our peers all over he world i have no time for my personal things
it is normal for me to use saturday for the family routine
since i had a slot of two hours between two appointments i decided to reward myself with a real italian pizza
the simple margarita was amazingly good
service fast and friendly as usual
chef raffaele tours around the tables to welcome the clients and collect special orders
in spite of all the prices are skyrocketing in shanghai bella napoli kept the menu quire stable and now it became more affordable than ever without compromising the quality
chef and owner guido esposito was doing a great job 11 years ago and he is still doing the same
five stars well deserved, after overdosing on dumplings in the early part of our trip to shanghai my wife and i considered all options for dinner one night and came across bella napoli just off west nanjing rd what a fantastic experience we had to wait about ten minutes for a table and for our trouble they gave us each a free glass of champagne the menu was extensive and reasonable and the service attentive and welcoming we split a pizza a bowl of pasta two beers and two sodas and the bill came to 274rmb great for families with kids large groups or relaxing dinners for two highly recommended, went here for dinner on our last night in shanghai and i must say that i am really glad we did

we tried one other well known italian restaurant during our time in shanghai but bella napoli is certainly the better of the two the pizzas are made using a real wood fired oven that is positioned in the heart of the restaurant and the pizzas are authentic to the traditional neapolitan style

as someone who has been to naples and had the chance try the original pizza i have to say bella napoli is not far from that lofty standard

we shared the diavola pizza for our entree and later i got the guidos choice pizza which was excellent also had the melanzani egg plant entree and my girlfriend had the marinara pasta

the atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable and the restaurant itself was favourably priced compared with others we have visited in shanghai

would certainty visit again and recommend, been their a few times and always satisfied with the food and overall experience great and simple italian dishes only the wine list could be improved, a true cantina italiana in shanghai great decor and ambience very good service and a amazing pizza excellent choice to eat good italian food in shanghai
pizza excelente massa fina e saborosa atendimento de primeira, cozy restaurant with friendly stuff and tasty authentic italian cuisine
the place is not an high end snob restaurant, excellent pizza in city center service is good and efficient choice of italian wine quite large at several prices that is handy i regularlly go since 2 years i live in shanghai and constant good level, our idea of finding a great pizza led us also to the neighborhood around this small restaurant which was interesting close to the metro stop pizza and salad were notable if not perfect, really cozy restaurant with friendly stuff and really tasty food good lunch set even if sometimes the portions are really small reasonably prices, the place is nice and clean they also have air filter inside and the advertisement doesnt lie its pizza
good selection of wines good ingredients and nice staff what else a restaurant needs maybe also good prices as this one has, the food in this place is really good the staff is very friendly the place is owned by an italian and you can really taste that happy i found this pace so close to where i was working, the place is a true italian restaurant run by itailan guy i loved their pizza and i used to go there when i lived in shanghai all the dishes are really excellent and you will feel like to be in italy absolutely recommended, we stumbled across this oasis amongst the local eateries and although it goes against my rule of eating local my business partner wanted a change pizza was amazing as were deserts i would say the pasta sauces werent as special but our overall experience was fabulous, love the pizza here love the vitello tonnato especially with their warm focaccia good central location, what a find came 2 nights great welcome food and service cosy and charming atmosphere clean and genuine italian food and menu, this popular restaurant disappointed on a recent visit there we were seated quickly and our drinks came quickly it went downhill from there after 45 minutes i asked if we were getting any bread as we had seen all the other tables receive theirs then my lasagne arrived an hour after ordering and the pasta was half cooked when i informed them of this i was offered a shot to make up not a happy experience and it seemed they did not care, the air quality is excellent with their purifier if you need a break from the pollution the pizzas are fantastic we sampled 5 different ones with 8 guests really excellent tiramasu and other deserts as well, this place is a real treat the service is great fun  you get loads of advice and friendly banter portions are big and it covers all the italian classics that can be tough to find in this part of the world for reasonable prices some decent wine too, great pizza made in a dire wood oven good service and plenty of very good italian dishes good for lunch and dinner if you like italian food worth a try, i go to bella napoli regularly for lunch food is good and service nice you are greeted with complimentary bread which is nice however observed waiters and head waiter as well to collect the leftovers from customers who left without finishing and secretly putting these breads back into the bread baskets which are offered to new customers arriving this is disgusting not coming back unless this review shows some response and change of attitude, went for the first time last weekend after trying many places in shanghai over the past 2+ years really great pizza excellent salad good atmosphere exactly what you want, peace of the place quite comfortably and pleasantly friendly and welcoming staff lovely warm cuisine thanks a lot for wonderful memories, went there w some friend from us we had seafood linguine and napoli pizza surprised by the quality and the real italian taste of both dishes, sometimes when traveling in china one gets sick and tired of chinese food bella napoli makes you forget you are in china great food fast service the place is great, ate here for a short business meeting and it was nice the location is convenient in the middle of jing an street parking is close by i enjoyed the food and the quality is good i want to try a few more dishes but so far it was decent the real trick to me is trying the mozzarella cheap places have very rubbery mozzarella for their caprese, lunch special two course for $65 rmb bargain great authentic italian foodlove it service fast and real italians running the place, pretty difficult to find in the former french concession area  a tiny tiny road with a sign on a bigger road just follow the sign then youll find a nice courtyard and garden with typical wood table with checked tablecloth its really amazing to dine outside and the staff is friendly and helpful we had a superb pizza but we saw other clients having very good meat and different pasta really appealing a place to go if you want to have a break from chinese food ah nature was around us and we saw a ferret looking at us and going around the garden , have been a regular visitor to this outlet and to its former location over the past 5 years and it delivers very consistent quality and value for money the small italian cocktail list is sensible and well executed the choice and value of the wines excellent and i eould have to say i rarely get beyond the antipasti they are so good their vitello tonnato is to my taste superb and as good as any ive had worldwide ditto the bresaola and carpaccio the range of salads and the melanzane other guests of mine have vouched for the quality of pastas pizzas and mains can honestly say ive never been disappointed at either the nanhui or the changle outlet  and both are very family friendly  bravissimo , this semiquaint italian joint is in a quiet alley in the jinang district i quite enjoyed the courtyard ambiance of the outside dining area i nice place to chill on a nice relatively cool shanghai summer evening the hostess was kind and welcoming and offered us several choices of tables place has a rather strong expat feel but it doesnt get loud or boisterous like other expat venues in shanghai the menu is extensive and covers all your basic italian that you might see in average tourist restaurants in rome or milano decent wine selection

the hostess was fabulous i was a little tuned off by the server when we party of two ordered a salad an a pizza she then asked okay and for you when looking at my girlfriend i mean the salad is huge and the pizza is a full sized pizza yes obviously we are sharing to me from a professional server it was a stupid question no worries

no refills on the house water a bit annoying as i waved them down a few times maybe they just didnt notice me or i wasnt trying hard enough no big deal

food arrived quickly the bella napoli house salad came first as requested and not at the same time as the pizza which was greatly appreciated

bella napoli salad lots of lettuce a little short on the cheese and ham a bit short on the oilvinaigrette dressing had to ask for more for 80 rmb i simply expected a bit more bang for the yuan it was a good salad but it is my opinion they are going a little light on the best parts of the salad

pizza i dont recall the name of the pizza we ordered but it was the one with mozzarella mushrooms and the spicy sausage incredible bread base very well done base was thin and the outside crust just perfect these guys have that down toppings were pretty good i thought they went a little scarce on the cheese but that is just me i like a bit more cheese on my pizza there was something that i didnt sit with me well about the tomato sauce perhaps it wasnt zesty enough it just tasted a little weak and not as sweet as it should have well priced for shanghai

i would come back here again for the ambiance try the pasta antipasta or order another pizza overall a good experience im just knocking it down to three stars for a few things mentioned above, located in a old bungalow this restaurant serves great pizza and the price is also reasonable  also had great dessert and drinks list, we arrived here at 510pm and the kitchen wasnt going to open until 530 only problem was the staff was sleeping on restaurant furniture and seemed to be annoyed that we interrupted their sleep i am new to the area and was really hoping for this to be a viable italian restaurant option for me but i would be nervous to bring any guests here again, walked in with friends to be surprised to see staff and management sleeping on the restaurant asked if they were open and was told they open at 530pm we were made to feel unwelcome because we woke them up the time entered was 510pm and no effort was made made by staff nor management to have us drink wine before the kitchen opened staff and management then laid back down on the restaurant furniture and slept, very cozy decoration in both shanghai locations guido the owner is here for many years and knows how to please foreigners and locals alike
excellent service
a great place for a nice meal with a friend, after several weeks in shanghai youve been wanting to eat something healthy and not fried italian food you can find the italian chef in the restaurant and this is really a sigh of relief  finally a pizza worthy of note and pasta cooked as it should be i really recommend it they also have beer moretti , ive been there more than one time i enjoined pizza and pasta dishes personnel is friendly roberto the assistant manager is great good choice of wine and dessert too its a must, we tried the caprese pizza and green salad ask for the chilly olive oil and sprinkle on the pizza friendly warm place with good ambience, went there a few times loved the atmosphere and the italian feelingdecent food and a quite tasty pizza, i am in shanghai often on business and stay in the french concession area bella napoli is always on my dining agenda the food is always good the service good and the ambiance is very relaxing if in the area its a must try, arrived here with hope wanted good italian food and it did not deliver they way i had hoped the bread was slightly under baked the salad rather boring the soup was very creamy the calamari a tad undercooked the sea bass  fine flavours drowned in the oil the sorbet was rock hard while the chocolate mousse was really good

the wine list was ok but short in fact to short so there was no excitement in flavours

good introduction to italian food for asians but not for europeans, it was a really nice itallian restaurant its pizzas were delicious it was the best pizza that i ate in shanghai","Cantonese cuisine",0.999853560990796
64,"this restaurant is in very nice residential area good choice if you like japanese cuisine and teppanyaki all foods are perfect easiest way to get to the restaurant by metro  line 1 hengshan road station, incredible quality of the food happy and cozy atmosphere excellent service loved the fireshow at the end of dinner for the banana brandy not to be missed, the kagen is a very nice and very good restaurant
weekends you have defiantly to make reservations on time  at least 2 days in advance
the quality of the food especially meet and fish is very good and the  all you can eat and drink offer is great and i can only recommend the restaurant because it is just delicious and the price is great for what you get, we simply loved this teppanyaki

everything we tried on the menu was of really high quality expertly prepared by a quiet unsmiling diminiutive chef

but what really sets this place apart in our minds is the mindblowing buffe deal  with all you can eat and all you can drink at a price that would just about buy a bottle of wine in most restaurants

sashimi sushi tenderloin giant prawns etc etc  everything made to perfection  washed down with sake wine beer or whatever tickles your fancy

this will henceforth be an obligatory stop on our shanghai itinerary, amazing experience in a real teppanyaki restaurant i was terrified to go to japanese restaurant because i dont eat fish but the quality and variety of choices is so interesting that i could try a lot of different foods the formula all you can eat is for me the best choice for having a full idea of their proposal, a great time in shanghai good and fine meal the dish and teppaniaki and the appetizer are good the all you can eat include drink for a reasonable price other menu and dish seen to be very good, take  all you can eat  option  it is worth its price  delicious beef  shelfish  cook is not too impressive but knows his job  unlimited beer and wine included in price  reservation recommended  it was very crowded but we managed to join table with two couples  good service, we actually were going to pin chuan down the street for dinner but after waiting a half hour to be served we left and come here without a reservation after initially telling us they were sold out they found four seats for us and we ended up having a very nice dinner

for about $40us pp we were served so many coursesand so much food and drink it was amazing to be honest the food was a bit under seasoned and there was no teppanyaki show like we see here in the us except for the grilled banana finale but we had a very nice time

the one other observation i had here was there were no locals it was all english speaking people from all over the world we would come back, had the buffee and choose around 8 dishes from vegetables to fish and meat and everything was absolutely delicious favourites from the amazing evening was the scallops filet mignon and salmon the quality of the meat and fish was very high and is one of the best teppanyaki restaurants i have ever eaten at drinks also included in the price not very clear in the menu tip 8 dishes is a bit to much as they are not very small which is a good thing, i was there for a business dinner second time actually with a chef cooking the food in front of me presentation was nothing special but the quality of the food was really good and every thing was very fresh i had a great time, teppanyaki restaurant where you can enjoy japanese food all you can eat and drink for 328 rmb great quality, i had been told that this was the best teppanyaki in the city it is quite expensive considering the numerous options you have in shanghai to go any restaurant of this kind so i expected the food quality and service to be just higher than the average what i found was that the food has some restrictions like you can only have a very few number of pieces of sashimi there are no oysters and just their lowestquality meat is available basically if you want something good and actually different from the other teppanyaki restaurants in shanghai you would be charge extra money including the difference of price that already exist

on the other hand the service what not really nice at all i went there with some friends and put as in a shared table with a really tiny space for eating whatever complain we had they didnt really show any interest or concern about it
we even complain because we order one pancake for each one for dessert and the manager got angry because he only wanted to give as one to share between all of us

suming up i will never come back here again considering the multiple options cheaper and more expensive that i have in an city such as shanghai, the food here is incredible the best tepenyaki i have had in shanghai have tried 4 or 5 all you can eatdrink deal is around 300rmb

one thing that let it down slightly was that we shared our tablechef with another group who came in and ordered loads which meant we had to wait ages for our next order and when we did the chef gave our dishes to them im sure we missed out on 2 or 3 dishes that we ordered as they were given to the wrong group if the chef could get the orders right and also engage a little with the customers he is serving it would improve the dining experience a lot for me, best value teppenyaki in town  the quality of the ingredients and price matches perfectly we literally could not move after the dinner and we were quite tipsy  thanks to unlimited food and drink menu slighly over 50 usd  definitely good value for money, great experience high expectations meet with great service and amazing food would recommend this place and hope to return in the future, very good food the staff didnt speak much english which made it kind of hard to order exactly what we ordered ie a couple of red wine glasses never arrived we payed approx 750 yuan for all you can eat, at 420 rmb i think it still to be quite a good value for allyoucan eat veggie fish seafood and meat tappanyaki plus sake and beers it even includes sushi from its sister restaurant haiku next door what is best is that the quality of the food product is far superior to most other places and the dining experience is higherend the wait staff and the chefs are very engaging a great night out with a group of friends or family for sure i have been a few times and the quality of experience is constant last weekend i dined there with 15 friends all at one ushaped table with two chefs, this is my go to teppanyaki in shanghai their allyoucaneatin2hours offers above average quality meat fish and veggie dishes plus a good choice of sushi rolls from their sister restaurant haiku next door its not the greatest and most innovative teppanyaki in the world but its solid and the best value for money i came across in shanghai so far as they have an early and a late slot for dinner and as they can get very busy booking is recommended i will definitely go back, we had a table of 8 and being teppanyaki always better with a group
opted for the all you can eat and expected a catch oh sorry sir not that or sorry sir that is a different menu however this never happened there is a separate deal and this is not covered but its a very small part of the menu the first 3 or 4 pages and you are guided to right section by the staff from the outset
for 328rmb roughly $65 aud  $50 usd it was all you can eat off the menu seafood fish and shellfish sashimi sushi beef filet mignon short rib fatty short rib tongue lamb chops chicken fois gras eel tofu vegetables noodles rice
plus free flow beer wine and sake
hands down the best value meal i have eaten in shanghai and one of the most delicious havent eaten at other teppanyaki places in town and now i dont need to
ingredients were fresh well prepared and turned over fast we were never waiting with an empty plate
same goes for the drinks often free flow is a misnomer and you have to chase down staff to fill your glass not here service was impeccable and glasses of wine and beer and bottles of sake were never empty and we never had to ask for a refill
only added cost was the flaming ice cream for dessert which is a spectacle and i recommend it if you can fit any more food in
the staff are very friendly and their english is good our chef was very well trained and all the meat was cooked perfectly to our liking despite 8 people ordering differently
the setting is relaxed and decor nice it was a little bright but all the better to see the food
cant recommend enough a great night and cannot think of a reason not to do it again and again and again, far above the well known chains like tairo where everything is something made with lots of butter and garlic not in kagen fresh and high quality ingredients turned into incredibly tasty dishes my favorites the fois gras wrapped in beef and the miso beef in addition the great attentive but never obtrusive service made this dinner a pleasure ill definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to friends, have been living here 2000 until 2004 and tepanyaki was a weekly regular back then it was 140 rmb or something like 20 usd or 15 euro now price is up to 329 rmb and the exchange gave the rest but its still great just places have changed back then it was dayu tepanyaki now the place to be is kagen and its for sure worth a try so u find out its for you or not quality is still great quantity is more than u should eat in any single day service is proficient and to my surprise the wine was drinkable without any system rejection its just one in many many food experiences but for sure one to try out when in shanghai apart from sichuan food, i went to this restaurant with a group of friends and we loved it

the food was delicious
whether it is meat or vegetables or seafood every ingredients was great quality the cooking was also perfect and the end result really tasty

we were lucky to have a great cook very smiley and nice plus very efficient and good cook

and in the end price was very reasonable considering the qualityquantity of the food we got this was a great value for money

definitely a great place to go with a group of friends to enjoy that teppanyaki experience, family visit with 2 young kids was an amazing experience we have always known the quality of food and cooking is very strong but the service this time around with an attentive wait staff who anticipated our needs was a first in shanghai we will go back again and again for the both the service food quality and thus value thank you for also providing reasonable pricing for children based on height

haiku continues to produce consistency in its brands for those who love teppanyaki and can consume and enjoy lots of quality food dont miss this place, we decided to go for the whole program all you can eat and drink soft drinks and beer sushi sashimi prawns fish scallops vegetables mushrooms and filet mignon
everything was really delicious and fresh the cook was absolutely professional and the service attentively and polite
whole meal for 328 rmb per person is really a good price
reservation is recommended have fun and enjoy a wonderful teppanyaki dinner, went there with my colleagues food was wonderful my only issue was that everything was so good i ate to much and food just kept coming and i couldnt eat it all and i really wanted to as it looked so good, staff  well they try to speak english so sometimes they dont understand the request but they can understand the overall  that is good
food  be prepared theyve charge about usd 55 for a all you can eat you can ask for shrimps they are huge beef ribs lamb vegetables and also is included the beverages soda juice and beer and desert
i go there every time i visit shanghai i would recommend a reservation
instagram carollifestyle
twitter caroldyamasaki, very good teppanyaki slightly expensive than the other similar restaurants in town of same type but meat fishveggies and drinks quality of kagen is far better than the other places and it is perfeftly located with other restaurants and bars like sasha zapatas etc all cooks are highly skilled and so waiters well recommend, even after they raised their price id still recommended going there for the all you can eat deal which in unforgettable any kind of fish or meat is available and its all absolutely fresh and tasty, you like teppenyaki japanese style best quality food and drinks on top of that you like modern restaurants with a nice interior this is the place if you are looking for a place where the locals gogo somewhere else only expats or wealthy chinese will pay for this excellent restaurant, went with family and friends and enjoyed a superb dinner the chef put on a show cooking the best ingredients of seafood beef and vegetables right in front of us first we enjoyed great sushi and shrimps and then this perfect meal free beer and sake definitely adds value to the dinner a perfect place to spend time with friends and chat while enjoying the food staff very professional and friendly, here it comes off a high ranking with plenty good reviews so that i and my wife decided to give a try�probably we were not the lucky one
we sat at the corner of the big table and were told 15 minutes later theres a big party had already booked the entire place we would have to finish the dinner within 1 hour called for the manager to see whether a free table for two can be reseated then was rejected since the whole restaurant was packed hey please tell me whoever would accept to eat only an hour in a japanese restaurant
secondly to the food and drink sashimi came out still unfrozen the beef was chewy and no taste beer tastes almost like a glass of water and some dishes we ordered never comes to the table
we left with a lots of disappointment, teppanyaki is always a good experience but when you have the best ingredients then it makes a big difference i love the giant shrimps and the fillet mignon, waiters are very kind and efficient compliments to the manager who has done a good training food was just okay we order different meat and seafood the meats were overcooked not juicy and tender seafood wasnt fresh at all had few beers even got sick in head the day after not sure its a good value, this is a top quality dining experience very fresh meats fish and vegetables which were cooked to perfection very good waiting staff and a terrific experience, kagen is the choice if i want to bring visitors for a all you can eat teppanyaki buffet price is rmb 328 per person the price is little on the high side but choose from appetizers sushi rolls seafood meats vegetables and drinks food is prepared by the chef right in front of you and my favorite is the jumbo prawns scallops oysters mussels the food is incredibly fresh and go for 2nd or 3rd helpings the only thing is that the restaurant will always restrict your dining time to 2 hours max, i love japanese food especially when it comes to teppanyaki and after hearing a buffet teppanyaki from a friend i definitely have been missing a lot so much sushi meat and seafood to choose from i had soooo much for dinner and i remember not being able to sleep afterwards service was slow but chefs were friendly however such an amazing place to have private occasions if you come with 10 people for a special celebration definitely worth the try for big appetite people, this restaurant is in think one of my favorite
you have a large choice from the seafood to excellence pieces of meat you can chose the way you want everything cooked and it is unlimited
looking at the chief cooking the food you have just closed is a great show
the price is maybe a bit expensive 200+rmb but it worth it, 328 rmb and two hours to eat as much as you prefer wine beer and sake all included maybe a bit overpriced one may think but when the dishes start coming you forget about the price

freshly deepfried calamari and other treats for appetizers all crispy sizzling and made to order
sashimi is fresh and tender super tasty wasabi is freshly made  not from a tube

scallops mussels and oyster all look and taste great and fresh also the salmon
for meat we had lamb chops foie gras rolled in beef slice and fillet mignon lamb chops had wonderful taste of lamb foie gras was surprisingly mild fillet mignon tender and fresh looking we ordered it as mediumrare the chef made it medium

the teppanyaki sauces next to your plate were all good and accompanied the seafood and the meat nicely

the beer is japanese kirin lager wines were something fairly regular from france sake was also some regular brew but still wonderfully satisfying

usually teppanyaki chefs put on a small show entertaining the guests with fire throwing around knives and so on in this place none of this was experienced all in all very high quality ingredients and quick service i would not say overpriced two hours was just enough  i left with a feeling that maybe extra 30 minutes would make this deal excellent, just had dinner at kagen teppanyaki in shanghai all you cant eat for 50usd was amazing value for money and the food and service were actually very good good quality of food and a very experienced chef with good service made it a great experience strongly recommend , visited the place with a group of friends after a long week of working the food was delicious service good and as the all in package was somewhat 3xx rmb it was a great experience can recommend it, the food in kagen is quiet good and not expensive service can be improved but the overall experience is very positive the all you can eat buffet for 288 rmb including drinks is a good choice, this restaurant is close to hengshan lu and always crowded reservation in advance is absolutely necessary all you can eat buffet for 288rmbperson is higher than in some other restaurants but it is worthy during every visit in shanghai we will go there at least once for people who like flamed banana you have to pay separate but at least for every newie it is a kind of must, shanghai has variety of everythingand quantity difficult is to find quality from all the all you can eat spots kagen stands out you pay slightly more but worth every penny starting from your arrival experience great quality of food present chefs highly recommended, at 288 the all you can eatdrink is a bit more than the other all you can eat teppanyaki restaurants in town
this small price is worth it though the food a better quality than the others and it is a bit more private
there are two dinner times at 630 and at 830 keep this in mind when you want a table not that you are rushed in eating like other reviewers wrote that didnt come at the right time, having lived in shanghai for over 4 yrs i can totally recommend this teppanyaki buffet to anyone visiting shanghai of course they do have alacarte menu but not worth it by far the nicest all you can eat buffet in sh well located in the french concession area the scallops the ox tongue and the bacon beef roll with foie is very tasty but on top of this their sushi rolls are fantastic nice portions and big variety everytime i come back to shanghai i keep returning here thumbs up, i think the food might be of an higher quality but it was very very very very good i can say that 
go there its a good adress im sure , having tried many teppanyaki places of different quality it more or less comes down to free flow beer sake and lots of meat i always return to kagen
the price might be around 100 rmb more than the usual 180 rmb places where to tourists and students flock but the quality of the food and atmosphere at kagen is simply better you even get to choose sushi from haiku of course you can also go to for other expensive teppanyaki places costing 700 and up but why if what you look for is a good night out with good quality food at the right price
just remember kagen work with shifts for dinner time so reservations can usually only be made for 1830 or 2030, i really recomend this place

choose buffet and eat alot incl perfect sushi rolls beer and sake

pris about 280

meat is very good fish aswell, whenever im in shanghai at least one dinner at kagen is a must it is the best teppanyaki restaurant ive been too and it is truly a pure pleasure every time
if you dont know it teppanyaki is from japan and you sit next to the steaktable with the chef and the preparations infront of you
it is a very pleasant way of having dinner and you see how the meal is cooked and the chefs are artists
the meat and vegetables are of the best quality and a must is to get the sparagus rolls so good they are addictive
i strongly suggest you order the buffe menu then you can eat  drink how much you want for 288rmb thats including local beer and sake risewine
the staff is not that good at english so it has a tendency to become a bit confusing but thats a part of the charm i would say, i definitely recommend this place the food is really nice and of quality  one of the best quality i have had in shanghai we ordered 3 set menus for 4 and it was plenty
ambiance is nice and service was not bad at all maybe slighty overpriced
i will definitely be back with visitors","Jazz bar",0.999635342419901
65,"weve been here twice since we live in shanghai and twice we brought friends and family you can eat authentic sichuan food here in a familiar international setting the staff is friendly the menu is clear with pictures and the food is awesome salty and spicy as sichuan food should be we ordered more than we could finish and paid about 100usd for 4 persons including drinks, we had a huge group  was so impressed how they were able to accommodate us on such short notice food was amazing staff was attentive highly recommend, the food was just ok actually very salty for my taste they put too much msg but thats just almost every restaurant in shanghai however their basil drop is too die for highly recommend basil drop to everyone its a must try, went here for a late lunch on a monday food is pretty good but on the heavier side potstickers were good and able to order an imported beer from seattle washington very clean and nice ambiance with red lanterns, my above title pretty much explains my experience at this very popular restaurant we ordered a chicken a beef and a cold dish  all were the worst version of these typical sichuan dish that i had ever we left without finishing none of them either the kitchen was having a bad day either, a very popular place in shanghai particularly amongst expats this is delicious sichuanese cuisine at reasonable prices the menu is extensive and conveniently features a chilli system which operates as a simple guide to customers who are concerned about the spiciness of each individual dish the cocktails are also excellent especially the basil drop and my personal favourite the sichuan iced tea service is friendly which is rare for shanghai and food is served promptly and in good time

with a rival sichuan restaurant spicy joint just around the corner i think its important to make a comparison for me in terms of food quality and choice they are identical however the atmosphere service and drinks quality is superior at sichuan citizen although it is more expensive and seems more catered towards expats than spicy joint if all you want is good sichuan cuisine then go to spicy joint and save some money if you want good cuisine coupled with nice cocktails and a more comfortable environment then choose here, the decor here was beautiful and we were given our own booth which ensured some privacy and quiet in what is quite a large restaurant the food was great we had bass fish duck and vegetable dishes all were extremely tasty although we found the duck to be a dish with just bones and surrounded by very spicy chilli this was the only disappointment amongst excellent dishes and drinks and in saying this it wasnt bad and other people may have enjoyed it although we found it too spicy and little value for the meat we got if you are sensitive to spice just look out for where they indicate it on the menu their english menu by the way is excellent
we would definitely recommend sichuan citizen for authentic very reasonably priced sichuan food looking forward to returning here, food staff decor is all good strongly recommend a visit and the basil cocktails are a total must, so many favorite spicy dishes at this restaurant and always overstuffing myself at this restaurant the highly recommended dishes are the chilled jellyfish in vinegar la zi ji shui zhu yu ma po to fu and jian shu ya wash these all down with a beer and you are in for a highly satisfying sichuan meal, dont know how it compares to other szechuan restaurants in shanghai but the food was spicy like it should be but not overly so service was efficient and price was good really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend it to spicy food lovers, this place is really excellent if youre looking for sichuan my buddies and i went here to compare the americanized dishes we know to their native chinese equivalents and we were thoroughly impressed got the king pao and the house special cold noodles both were significantly better than weve had anywhere in the us also the atmosphere is excellent and they take visa cards whenever i come back to china id absolutely go here again, they have a picture menu with english so anyone who knows some english can order food with out fear there are items in your food that are not listed on the menu i am a vegetarian and the spicy tofu did have a little bit of pork in it the water spinach was very good, just opposite donghu hotel where i usually stay when in sh fast and friendly service real hot sichuan food unfortunately often very oily, this restaurant has quite a long menu with excellent food and even better prices the cocktail of the house is very original tasty and well prepared the restaurant is surrounded by ver y nicebars to go for a drink afterwards and even to dance and stay out till early morning cant miss it, this basil drop at sichuan citizen is actually one of the best drinks i have ever tried really good one and a toptop service from the staff recomend it for everyone , stopped by here for a late lunch whilst stopping in the french concession district  have to say the food was simply amazing the restaurant is comfortable and the service leaves nothing to be desired 

my only regret was i didnt get the chance to go twice, casual and relaxed but with a very busy vibe  this is a great shanghai sichuan experience food is fresh spicy if you want and delicious it is a casual but trendy place  a lot of eoropeans there on the night of our visit as always with shanghai  wine list very basic and relatively expensive  but the tsing tao is cold and goes well with the food oh and we saw a lot of basil drop cocktails around the place, great service and great food and reasonable price you definitely have to try their cocktail basil drop it is awesome i advise you to book before showing up at the restaurant it is always packed, i have heard about sichuan citizen for years and never went dropped by last weekend and overall i found the service far worse than average in shanghai and the food was a bit bland for a restaurant with sichuan in the name judging by the crowd sitting around it this must be an easy place for visitors to find order and feel like they went local imho that pretty much what you dont want in a restaurant especially with so many other options available in this city, had a very pleasant dinner finished off with basil drop cocktails excellent rotating tables to allow you to share the great range of tasty dishes reasonable prices for the french quarter and nice area to wander around check it out but bear in mind that last food orders are at 930pm, went there three times but wont go there again nothing amazing there concerning food good for tourists,  they keep the windows and doors opened therefore we can hear the streets noise and smell cigarettes smoke which is very uncovenient in winter it will be closed

= dishes are normal not great not bad

+ the menu is actually pretty large in terms of choices
+ drinks have a reasonable price
+ nice crew some of them can speak english a bit, the restaurant was very nice with an enchanting ambiance we were glad to be seated without reservations early in the evening then see the place fill rapidly behind us the food ordered was a variety of vegetable fish and meat dishes that were all good but none outstanding my wifes basil drop drink was delightful as i opted for my obligatory tsingtao beer, center shanghai where you would normally get a lot of expensive fancy places  this place is lovely surprise some may say is chinese for foreigners but who cares the food is great the place is fullnoisy and alive go with larger group so you can order many dishes to taste from, got the basil drop which was good we all ordered a dozen different dishes to share the cauliflower was good but beware going there without a translator i ordered a cold spicy chicken dish that had quite a lot of bones in it that we had to eat around would go again only if we have someone to help us decipher what we are ordering, i had a squid and pepper dish that earned 2 chili peppers on the menu it was a pretty spicy dish but nothing too crazy place is pretty well set up to accommodate nonchinese speakers with english menus and attentive servers, been there with friends living in shanghai food are very tasty and service is good the restaurant is a little bit noisy but the ambiance was cool i will certainly go again when coming back to shanghai, well we wanted to have a go at sichuan cuisine so we went to this recognized institution in shanghais former french concession
first thing you notice this restaurant is mainly filled with foreigners thats not necessarily surprising as local shanghai food is not so spicy and sichuan is one of the hottest and spiciest on earth in my opinion
after ordering different dishes one thing you quickly notice is that no matter if there is no chilly on the menu next to the dish supposedly meaning it is not hot pretty much everything you eat is hot only the level differs from dishes to dishes if you cannot eat hot at all i would not recommend this place nor sichuan food for that matter
we liked almost everything except a pork and rice ball that felt out of place compared to the other dishes and did not taste great mainly because ginger was half the composition
service and atmosphere are good there are rooms you can isolate if you are coming in groups probably need to reserve though and as the restaurant is in donghu lu you will have plenty of options for bars after to extinguish the heat
one note on sichuan food is it spicy and hot yes but it is more a numbing heat ma la in chinese than a brutal heat if you ever tasted raw sichuan pepper youll remember the heat but then the numbing effect of it, i often go to this restaurant when im visiting shanghai it has a wide variety of sichuan foods so you can have things that are harder to find in the typical western sichuan restaurant but also enough basics to appeal to someone new to the cuisine or who doesnt like their food that spicy the service has always been good it is very reasonably priced especially for the french concession and it is easy to find on donghu road right off huaihai road, i have been going to this restaurant for years and would recommend it to anyone who is new to shanghai
if you like spicy food this is a good place to start

their basil drop martini is a must absolutely delicious their home style chicken first chicken dish in the menu is also a must along with the long thin mushrooms and braised eggplant

i have noticed over the past year their standards in food quality are not as high as they use to be but thats just coming from someone who has lived here for a while i hope they take note of this comment overall though its a must for shanghai you wont be disappointed, great service and great food not sure about it being expats only as some other reviews have suggested i found the busy restaurant to be full of locals with a couple of large tables of westerners menu is pretty extensive and the food is delicious and some of it was very spicy although if you order the chicken with chilli what can you expect
had a prawn dish good a chicken dish great but surprisingly lacking in chicken a beef dish delicious and some greens functional thought it was nice of the wait staff to ask if we wanted the vegetables to be spicy or not glad i chose not as it was a nice cooling element to to the meal
decor and ambience are nice although i had a bit of a problem with the lighting i like to see what i am eating and while i am a fan of low light dining the lighting is very very warm i can see from the pictures other reviewers have added that this has the effect of making all the food look the same but thats a small complaint from an otherwise great meal
there are a couple of private dining rooms upstairs which might be better for a large group and if you book ahead for a table maybe ask to sit near the window we didnt and while our table was nice it seemed a lot more relaxing and intimate at the window tables
wait staff all have good english and were very friendly and attentive
now the basil drop
yes its delicious yes its a must
but not because its delicious i found it extremely effective in cooling off the palate after a few dishes of very spicy food
they must have either huge vat of it somewhere or a team dedicated to making it because it was delivered in about 11 secs after ordering it
get one you wont be disappointed, we were looking for a sichuan restaurant and found this one on tripadviser with good reviews the restaurant takes reservation and has kindly reserved a table in the back quite area for us the food is not very authentic but the taste is good we liked the dandan noodles and spicy oil dumpling the frog and cocktail were also good the restaurants became quite busy at night, nice sichuan food served in easytoshare dishes start with any kind of veggies and finish with the knuckle deep fried pork steaks and beef bao book beforehand and dont miss the basel drop or ginger splash cocktail at the end, very good dishes spice rate goes from 1 to 3 with 1 already very spicy cool situation wonderful basil cocktail very nice, we had a fantastic dinner here starting with the best basil drink ever seems to be only western people going here, first time for me in shanghai and just over the day as im staying in changzhou we were recommended this restaurant by a friend very friendly welcoming good table overseing the street  windows open comfy chairs and low enough to keep your head close to the soup or noodle bowl we had chicken kung pao with cashews and a lot of chillies caramellised beef with pepper sauce spice won ton soup and rice good dishes for sure could have had more the menu is extensive and has everything for any taste well cooked and well served a cold pitcher of beer shows they know what western people prefers the chinese seem to prefer warm beer all in all a very pleasant experience, a sichuan restaurant but not too spicy we tried several different dishes that were all delicious

was really surprised by the basil cocktail after reading so many rave reviews for the drink on ta my wife tried it and we both thoughtmeh tasted like basil to be sure but no other complimentary flavors just like pureed basil with a hint of alcohol certainly not a must, i have been here 3 times in my 2 trips to shanghai food is served family style with a lazy susan on the table there is a nice variety of foods and the service is also very good i wish there were places like this in michigan
this place is known for basil martinis it sounds funny and is very green but has a refreshing flavor consider it a must to try there are many vegetable dishes but they also have ribs, a lovely restaurant that opens entirely to the street the help was so so but who cares its the food that counts my caiparhina had some sugar grains in it that might not pass in brooklyn but still pretty good the food was excellent though
had dry fried beef with scallions cauliflower with bacon house noodles blistered string beans all excellent highly recommend, good authentic food my favorite is the cabbage rather bizarrely everything i have tried is good i have been 3 or 4 times
they do a signature cocktail made with basil everyone loves it but it is not my thing really but do give it a try, great dinner on our last night in shanghai  very authentic sichuan food and one of the best we have had very reasonable price as well location was very central on donghu road the basil drop cocktail is a must try, great authentic food super service reasonable prices
try the margarita or basil cocktail and come in a group then you can try more our favorite the cauliflower with bacon, very nice food be aware that it can be quite spicy even if marked with only one out of 3 chilis in the menu you must try their signature basil drop cocktail, authentic szechwan food great service and the place is buzzing like hell surprisingly even though full of expats the food was fairly authentic to my mind though i am not an expert in the cuisine or region the spice levels are off the charts and hell has no fury worse than a 3chilli dish on this menu the basil drop cocktail is a musthave and is best left to rest for a while with a generous portion of ice or stick to an icecold beer  you will need it one serious piece of advice reserve in advance else you could find yourself at a corner table with another corner cutout to fit one more person  a little too cozy was the common opinion across the table 
dined in april table of 5 friends, had a wonderful meal in this excellent restaurant it almost seems to have been designed with expats in mind as the clientele were basically 100 foreign
but its certainly no worse for that and has a great atmosphere
as stated by others the basil drop cocktail with or without alcohol is a must and was a true revelation
the food matched the cocktail and we were presented with a huge range of different dishes half vegetarian half not all of which were beautifully cooked and some of which were seriously spicy but never hot
a great evening completed by a bill that did not make us wilt very reasonable
an absolute must if you are in shanghai and somewhere i will return to if i am able to, the restaurant sees to be very popular among expats but the vibe is nevertheless great typical chinese food in a nice decor a smoking room red velvet on walls and their delicious trademark basil cocktail and truly not too expensive we had a total of 6 dishes 4 drinks between us two and paid like 40euros in total, great intro to sichuan food for westerners visiting shanghai for the first time the options are inexpensive but very tasty and it made it easy to order several dishes to tryshare i really enjoyed my basil drop cocktail  so unique and delicious, ive actually been looking forward to come back to shanghai partly to try this drink again its something special
the food is very nice spicy the cuisine is quite adapted to foreigners if i understand it right worth s visit, sichuan citizen is a great place to get introduced to chinese cuisine not too scary and very tasty coming from an expat in shanghai this place is one of the best in town prices are good food is excellent atmosphere is great same group as other great and popular restaurantbar in shanghai

make sure to order the signature drink basil drop

you want to make a reservation and you want to ask for a downstairs table best to be enjoyed with at least 4 people or more as you want to order many dishes to share, ive got to be honest i use tripadviser regularly this is ashamedly my first review as i normally cant be bothered to pass judgement this however was different it was that bad i just couldnt refrain myself and let me tell you its not been easy as every time i begin to think of the food that was served to me my stomach begins to do backflips and i start to dryheave this was nothing short of a embarrassment and makes a mockery of chinese food in general the foodif you can call it that was beyond greasy and the meat nonexistent a million miles from fresh the food was out in minutes and appeared to be re heated left overs from the weekendthey get their sichuan spice by drizzling chilli oil over absolutely everything it generally makes my local chinese takeaway in the uk look like a michelin starred establishment im completely bemused by previous reviews and can only assume its under new management or theyve woken up recently one morning and decided to give up on life something they clearly want to bestow upon others as they have managed to put me and my girlfriend off food for good not only is this our worst dining experience in shanghai its my worst dining experience ever handsdown im a non believer but ill be praying to the food gods tonight to stop me getting food poisoning unfortunately i dont fancy my chances as i cant leave zero stars my only compliment would be that they must be the only cooks who can make food taste better on the way out than it does on the way in and for that i applaud you please avoid like the plague","dumpling restaurant",0.346991024352378
66,"absolutely perfect taste just like any restaurants in india  must try their food  tastes great, i came here in december on my own after eating three weeks of chinese food the food here was lovely very tasty and the staff were also really nice and very efficient i would highly recommend this indian to anyone looking for some tasty indian cuisine, vedas  good food in an interesting location make reservations take the elevator not the stairs down the side alley

my family decided to look for some indian cuisine and we chose vedas in puxiold french concession we found the building easy enough but followed one sign that led us and two locals down a side alley and up the stairs we missed the elevator since you have to go into what looks like a office building entrance

we were greeted by the owner and friendly staff and seated near the window and a good view of the kitchen viewing area great for watching the chefs at work

we ordered
 samosa for appetizers
 nilgiri chickencurry
 jeera aloo

the jeera aloo was great but i was expecting more flavor from the curry at first my fault as i had through thai when ordering both were still great as were the samosas and was the naan bread with butter and garlic

worth going back again, we had been to shanghai for the new year and we visited here seeing the reviews in trip advisorythe food was really good worth goingand we met a supplier who was very friendly and helpful who is from himachal pradesh guess his name is naveen he served us the best food and gave us all the information for home delivery too so we never missed the indian food in shanghai, good foodauthentic indian
no complaintsroticurry all top notch
service also attentive
definitely among best in shanghai, surprisingly amazing delivery of our orders and a great atmosphere we had a great birthday party there, we enjoyed a lot vedas indian restaurant for the tasty food and the nice indian furniture the food was very good the dishes were generous and we paid a fare bill
the staff is very kind and they can speak a perfect english
we are terribly satisfied with vedas and we warmly suggest everyone to go to, we went there for diwali dinner as there is very limited places in shanghai where you can find indian food we ordered the tandoori chicken and it was cooked perfectly the naans were well done but the vegetables and meat dishes need more work the masala that was created was still pretty raw i could taste the raw uncooked onions but besides that it was a hearty meal as we were all craving some form of north indian food, literally travelled all around shanghai looking for a tasty inexpensive indian place to eat for my 6 person family

we were fortunate to stumble upon here shortly after having a long tourist sightseeing day

kids were starving and we were given a free snack appetizer to eat by the waiter when he noticed how hungry the kids were

elegant decor great not just for families but even couples and business meetings

i hope to return here and will without a doubt recommend the restaurant to friends relatives and anyone i know going to shanghai

i, this place is truly amazing went there twice in a span of 4 days during my recent visit to shanghai for business was accompanied by my colleagues from india germany china  vietnam and each one of them cherished the food the owner himself was continuously involved right from the time we entered to taking down our order  serving us did not expect such high quaintly of indian food in a place like shanghai a special treat for all meat eaters and dal lovers the variety available is just perfect my regrets could not review this place earlier due to travel but sir please keep up the good work and serve everyone your delicious food this place is a must visit for all my future trips to shanghai  cheers, i live in hangzhou but when i go to shanghai i always go to this place which is my favorite indian restaurant in china good management we are always very well welcomed food is always excellent many indian restaurant offers nimboo pani so you should added to the menu will come back soon , excellent indian restaurant in shanghai staff are very friendly and the food is very authentic for a good price highly recommend, the food was delicious the service was great the owner was really nice we had samosas as a starter i found them oily but that could just be me the allo gobi and daal tadka was delish would def go back, very authentic indian food every time i visit vedas very close to jingan temple rotis perfectly baked and veg subjis we tried were rightly blended to give authentic indian taste recommend vedas for authentic taste lively team in vedas make your time at restaurant pleasant in my view currently its one of the top rated indian restaurant in shanghai my wife particularly very much like lemon rice here, being a vegetarian i feel same taste as i feel in my favorite restaurant in india

daal tadka is most delicious

i tried other restaurant also butcouldnt find such taste, visited vedas this evening for dinner mainly because it was the closest indian restaurant to my hotel i was impressed with the quality of the food and venue the service was even pretty good ill definitely be going back for the tandoori mixed grill again well worth a visit, what a delight situated on the 3rd floor and recommended by our hotel the puli food was to die for and a wonderful change from chinese food having been to india i have had the pleasure of indian food made local and this was not far off excellent starter onion bharji and cauliflower we had the prawn curry and lamb murghli and have to say stunning large portions so my advice is share a starter and by the way the chutney was marvelous breads too well done and not those heavy type naans you get in the uk nice atmos and setting and the delight of the night was the manager letting us have his prepaid taxi to get us back to he hotel it was a public holiday and raining heavily very generous we were so grateful and very kind of him brilliant service and nice wine selection reasonably priced value here was very good and would highly recommend you wont be disappointed go try, all the immediate suspects preformed perfectly lentil soup keema nan chicken tika masala paneer tika tandoori chicken and of course great mango lassie and gulab jamoon sweet cheese balls on the sweeter side the ambiance and decor are lovely even a beet romantic with indian quite songs playing in the background do not look for this restaurant on the street front it is located on the 3rd floor of the building, tandoor items are awesome therethe service is good enoughwe use to go there for our office partythe price is little high than other indian restaurant, the restaurant interior is very nice the service by the head waitress was also very good ordered the mixed tandoori platter which was so delicious the tadka dahl was also great with the accompanying naan and rotis veery delicious would recommend, after dining at the tandoor the previous day our local chinese contact brought us to vedas we ordered a chicken tikka  dal a veg gravy and some beers  the dal was pretty tasty worth a visit, the service was quite good and people talk nicely but the food quality is not great they added freshly chopped tomatoes in pain puri chaat paneer was dry and one of our dish did not arrive till the last moment not recommended for indians in shanghai, the place is clean the food was delicious the service was very attentive warm and welcoming i had mainly vegetarian starters dont remember the names and a palak paneer the portions are big and well presented i left very satisfied and looking forward to my next visit, the owner anoop is a starpre meal cocktails are rockingbombay velvets are not to be missedthe food hits the spot every timechicken kesari to get the taste buds going chicken madras accompanied with the vegetable samosas basmati rice and a garlic naan bread leaves you fully satisfied and happy nursing a cold white wine whilst savouring the taste of indiasimply the best indian around town and furtherget in amongst it, a bit disappointed with the visit vegetarian samosa was not as good as the one we had in rangoli at tan zi fang the naan bread was not soft and fresh that it should be rogan josh lamb was fine and the best dish was tandori chicken which was juicy and tender saw awards in 08 by thats but apparently not lately, this restaurant was 10 mins walking from swissotel hotel where i stayed we ate hear almost twice the food was very authentic and indian i ate at almost three this was the best hence no hesitation in recommeding the same, first of all i want to tell interior of this restaurant is very beautiful  elegant
if talk about staff than they were very good in indian restaurant all chinese staff but they are really good  have knowledge of indian food
restaurant is very neat  clean not stinking with typical indian spices  not dirty like other indian restaurants in out of india
i almost visited 1314 countries  i do visit indian restaurants there in them this one is good in cleanness hope they maintain it
if i talk about food than i ordered tandoori chicken half it was okay i found some portion raw also ordered butter chicken it was also okay because too much tomato pury  it need to cook for little bit more time because in that also chicken was little bit raw i think they dont remove fat from chickennot sure for that
so food was okay but interior clean ness staff was superb, i have been to vedas twice during business visits to shanghai and the food is good and the service nice the music does get a bit loud later in the evening staff is courteous and more than happy to get a cab for you or even write directions in mandarin, by far the most authentic indian food in shanghai with nice ambience  friendly staff  management  been there quite a few times in the last many years  the food consistency is also impeccable  am sure with this kind of service  quality food indian food lovers in shanghai are in safe hands  , conveniently located near the hilton hotel an easy walk the restaurant has beautiful decor from hardwood floors to antique chinese doors and lamps a full bar that makes enticing lemon drop martinis took the edge off from my business day
food is absolutely delicious cooked by authentic indian chefs our group had about 8 dishes and it would be hard to say which was best all the traditional indian favorites on the menu the staff were kind prompt and friendly and the ownermanager came by our table to share a drink and a chat my only complaint is that i ate far too much
highly recommended please do give them a try, simply the best north indian restaurant in shanghai food quality is excellent service is excellent ambience is superb, the food was authentic indian though served by chinese they were well trained for indian dishes they even went out of their way for special requests good ambience and good service the naans were especially crisp and tasty, this was my second visit to vedas the atmosphere was charming the food was delicious and filling we left the restaurant very satisfied i will make sure i visit again the next time i am in shanghai, i order kadai paneer and butter naan the kadai paneer was too blend means only tomato gravy with raw tomato and capsicum with raw paneer with only taste of tomato gravy butter nan was so thick and it got dry in one minute and it was even not chewable
i do not recommend this restaurant at all for any reason
i also saw in their menu they even charge for the pickle and onion this is something we cannot expect for indian cuisine restaurant, this place was pricey and the quality was pretty poor its what id imagine actual indian street food might taste like with a lack of flavor the experience was made all the more worse by the place being understaffed waitresses where running around serving others and it took a while to get served and a large group of loud americans being seated in the center of the restaurant making it very hard to even have hear a person directly opposite me im sorry but this place is no way a top shanghai restaurant, we popped into vedas for dinner and were pleasantly surprised by their friendly staff and good selection of authentic indian food while the food was delicious i did find the place a little over priced paying up to 30 rmb for naan and around 36 rmb for mini appetizers would definitely recommend to anyone not on a budget, this restaurant has it all amazing service authentic beautiful food and awesome atmosphere
as an expat we are fed up of eating mediocre indian food in kebabs on the grille with reconstituted meat but vedas is of the standard you find at home
you must try goan prawn curry and the poppadom bites to start are delicious
go there, having tried a couple of indian restaurants in shanghai and having heard a lot about vedas i ventured there for lunch on the weekend

the restaurant was easy to find and it is on the 3rd floor of a building

the decor is average and the restaurant is large so you are not bumping tables with the folks next to you

the menu is fairly small and covers all the typical dishes youd want to try out

i ordered a papdi chaat as the starter and it was average i personally found the sauces to be a bit watery and the puris to be perhaps verging on staleness the chickpeas and potatoes were cold

i then went in for the chicken tikka masala along with jeera rice

the jeera rice portion was generous and would be good for two people it had not been cooked well in the sense that the boiled flavor overpowered the other flavors a good jeera rice usually had a more fried flavor in my view

the chicken tikka masalas gravy was decent but strangely i could actually see the dashes of red chili powder that had been added to the dish

i am very particular about the meat i eat and the tikkas in the dish were primarily dark meat and a bit stringy

the service was prompt and efficient and the staff spoke decent english

overall the food was better than the other places ive tried and i hope there is better out there, this was my first stop to an indian restaurant in shanghai but this was nice and positive surprice best is the food its good and made of good fresh ingredients i highly recommend this restaurant, good quality food including familiar favourites chef made it extra spicy as requested good selection of wines and beers too nice setting, best indian food in town with great staff and friendly owner took our order over phone itself quantity is good, we stayed in shanghai for about a week and on weekend we went to this place as it was just a few minutes away from metro station the food was good much better than what you are served overseas in indian restuarants i have tried indian restaurants in many countries and this one is certainly among the table toppers serve you authentic indian cuisines go for it if you are in shanghai, we were early for dinner and pretty much the only customers we were warmly welcomed and treated like family we ordered many courses customary for our chinese friends and each dish was better than the one before it we ate till we could hardly move having eaten indian food all over the us and in europe i would definitely put veda at the top of the list simply wonderful we visit shanghai once or twice a year and will definitely make veda a part of our visit to chna, i have visited this restaurant a few times in the past 2 years and unfortunately recently it seems to have gone downhill during my last visit to shanghai in august 2015 i visited for dinner and it was just ok  i put it down to an offnight however during my stay in shanghai this week i visited again for lunch and was not impressed the servers and the chefs are all chinese which might be the issue not sure if this restaurant has changed hands but its not the authentic indian restaurant that it was i will not be back, the lighting is low and calm the waitresses and dressed nicely you might overhear other patrons mentioning to each other how delicious the food is its a good place for a date id recommend the dal and the eggplant with such a unique vegetarian tradition i prefer go meatless at indian restaurants one complaint is that the food is never spicy enough, located in a food court like building on changshulu jululu near xibo restaurant the decoration is nice open kitchen seems pretty clean we like their food very much esp veg samos and curries the owner is indian and always there and greet his customers guess this is the success of being one of the longest running indian restaurant in town, good indian food in china for indians along with good ambience the timings are challenge for indian as we dont feel like hungry because of different time zone, my hotel manager suggested me bukhara indian restaurant he said this very indian restaurant here and many of their guest been there even i also have read good review about this restaurant so at first day i visited it but when i reach their i surprise to know that bukhara is closed and at same place there is new indian restaurant called vedas food is ok but in china u can not expect perfect indian food ambiance is very nice restaurant is spacious location is good and easy to find as it is in main cross road ya food is little bit expensive, vedas is a good choice when looking for indian food in shanghai service was prompt the food was flavourful and its moderately priced, i visited this place for lunch to satisfy my cravings for indian cuisine

ambience  excellent soft indian music was playing when i got there the restaurant was spicandspan you can see the chefs and the kitchen through a glass panel looks clean to me too

service  the staff understands english service was prompt i didnt have to wait long for my food

food  the free appetizer came with chutney and a green dip sorry i dont know what it is called i love it then came the paneer tikka which i also love i had the lamb rogan josh which was also very good with the right amount of spiciness youll know the ingredients are fresh the garlic naan lacks in flavor though i was expecting a more garlicky flavor the kulfi was delicious although it tasted more milky than pistachio the mango lassi was awesome

price  more expensive than my other meals in shanghai i paid rmb 266 for my meal

to get there i took metro line 2 got off at jing an temple exit 2 and walk a few meters along huashan rd close to hilton hotel

im wondering why it was just me and a group of caucasian guys that were there for lunch the place is probably more famous for night out as there is a bar close to the entrance i would be coming back to try the other dishes","Japanese cuisine",0.999815354856466
67,"we dined at this restaurant six months ago on our last trip to shanghai and had a wonderful meal the peking duck was as good as any we have had anywhere and the rest of the food and service was excellent
we went back tonight with the same 6 people since we all enjoyed it so much the last time
the duck was still excellent but that is where the comparison ends the service was
horrible not a waiter or manager to be seen for 10 minutes at a time the duck a 2 starters arrived at the table almost as fast as we ordered and the rest of the starters took about 30 minutes
the balance of the meal arrived about a half hour after that some of the portions looked like they were for one person
all in all it was a disaster we spend about 2 12 months a year in shanghai and we will not return, as an avid peking duck fan i was eager to try my first version of the dish in mainland china xindalu did not disappoint as a solo diner and a walkin its possible to order the duck straight away on its own i ordered a half duck which was a huge relief as i thought there might be a dayahead order or a 2person minimum requirement however they do seem to only have a limited number of ducks available for each service the presentation is superb and the taste  wow ive never had such tasty hoisin sauce may never want to have the supersweet factory versions again can i please have the recipe it also comes with a kind of garlicky vinegar which elevates the flavours to another level and of course the duck itself is everything it can be  crispy tender juicy flavoursome and perfectly carved thank you xindalu for making my peking duck dreams come true, excellent duck better than most of the famous peking duck restaurants in beijing better than the famous da dong and quanju de
however other than the duck i found most of the other food over priced some decent tasting items but when you come here focus on the duck, ate here twice peking duck was very good although not the best ive ever had beggars chicken is cooked in clay pot amazing table side presentation remember to order a day in advance my fav dish was the pork belly cooked in a pyramid shape served chinese wines which were also very nice, the peking duck is superb as well some other shanghainese dishes they have a fire wood oven to cook the duck excellent service, its really an amazing place i chose to live in hyatt to be close to this restaurant absolute must have when you are in shanghai everything i tried here didnt disappoint me crispy dark is super but even if you want to try smth new no worries go for it it will be fantasticthough names of the dishes didnt tell me anything at all it was a great celebration of combination of flavors and you can also see the chefs at work which is very inspiring well done, what a fun way to have peking duck they cook in an open kitchen with a wood burning oven where the cook the entire duck it is fascinating to watch them use long poles to put the ducks into and out of the oven then they carve the duck table side the duck was delicious the restaurant was modern and fun the service was great and the experience unique, this is an above average hotel restaurant with one outstanding dish  the peking duck you need to preorder it 24hours in advance and it is expensive but wellworth it the duck is beautifully burnished and served three ways  skin breast and leg you dip the skin in sugar which melts into the duck fat and is unctuous rich and food orgasmic the breast is moist and flavorful as is the leg which you put into pancakes with scallions and hoisin sauce also good was the kung pao shrimp the shrimp was deep fried in a way that i havent experienced before a crackly thick coating that was incredible the rest of the items on the menu are standard and overpriced the restaurant is on the bottom floor of the hyatt and is to the right of the front entrance id suggest trying to get a seat by the kitchen which is much more lively than the rear room which felt a little stuffy, excellent meal at xindalu we preordered the peking duck dont go thinking you can just order it preorder is necessary the presentation and quality was excellent additionally enjoyed the other dishes as well kung pao shrimp was probably the best i have ever tasted service was attentive but must say that the ambience was well below the price level with that said i did like the large open kitchen overall excellent meal, good chinese restaurant focused on hotel guests with usual a bit of everything menu with everything good but nothing outstanding the place is nice modern open kitchen style and perfect option for a quick lunch or a simple evening diner, the restaurant is located at hyatt on the bund they serve very nice chinese food the peking duck is amazing to stratosphere however theres language barrier issue here given the fact that the restaurant is in hyatt it kinda annoyed me but well i have to let it go, expensive but very authentic chinese food loved their peking duck xiaolongbao and fish  crab dish and of course their dessert, table side presentation of the roasted duck as it should be exceptional quality and delicious service was attentive and friendly overall a good value will dine here again, love the quality chic interior setting of this place the food here focuses on local food from shanghai the pekking duck is incedible as is the braised pork this place is located inside the hyatt great views excellent evening, in a land full of awesome food how does one stand out we had a sizzling cod dish that blew my mind and sent my taste buds to one of the happiest places they have ever been if youre worried about price stop reading and go to one of the awesome restaurants over the road but if you want food laced with exhilaration come to xindalu, wide variety of foods good quality very busy during rush hours  reservation recommended staff is could be better in english, a late arrival into pvg followed by painfully slow immigration lines made xindalu a good choice for a late dinner the menu is varied with many takes on chinese classics  many from the shanghai region my favorite was kung pao shrimp  just the perfect blend of peppers nuts and currants  all giving just the right amount of heat the pork pot stickers were some of the best ive ever had would like to go back next time and explore the menu, we really enjoyed our dinner in xindalu in particular they really did a nice job with the peking duck the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff were good, we had high expectations about xindalu but left disappointed we had booked ahead and ordered a half of their famous roast duck but when we arrived on a rainy sunday night the restaurant was almost empty the prices were high but the service and setting not what we expected from a luxury 5 star restaurant

i have to say the duck was pretty good it was carved to perfection at our table although given the high price the amount of duck meat we actually received was rather stingy the skin was delicious but am really not convinced about dipping it into white refined sugar am sure they could come up with a nicer accompaniment

the other dishes we ordered shrimp fried rise and the local shanghai noodles were ok but nothing special and we came away feeling disappointed overall and with quite a hefty bill there are better restaurants elsewhere in shanghai, as this restaurant is claimed to be the best place for peking duck in shanghai i have to say it was in my opinion quite average having eaten this dish several times before both in eu us  au i have had better maybe chef had a lousy day chili string beans were good and pan fried dumplings as well however service left us having to nag at service staff with a final bill nearing 1400 yuan yould get better value and a more rememberable meal at yangs eating 6 yuan dumplings

im sorry but xindalu is hyped vue bar was nice though, this is a lovely place to take business colleagues for peking duck the dish was expertly prepared and the service was great i also enjoyed the spicy green beans and a colorful mixed mushroom dishbut everything was delicious so you cant go wrong with whatever you order yum, we came too early and didnt have any reservation so the hostess placed us on waiting list while waiting we had a friendly chat with the hostess told her that we will be leaving for the usa our home the following day and that we were there just for the duck surprisingly an extra table was made to accommodate us it was worth the wait because it was the best night after many flights multiple sight seeing tours and cruise along yangtze river our server was very nice he guided us through the whole business of eating the duck the proper way yes it was pricey but we get what we paid for btw i tried different peking ducks while in china but those were way inferior than xindalus, we stay at the hotel and we come these restaurant to eat peking duck but the staff would sad that is only certain hour but every other table eat peking duck so it is understandable and also i asked what it is and they say to certain people it is unforgetable, i can eat at least one duck for myself alongside the starters and kung pao prawns the tea is a perfect accompaniment to the duck, one of the best beijing ducks in town add nice dumplings dry onion noodle hot and sour soup and you have a tasty filling meal if you enjoy this cuisine you can consider their dining card which gives you 50 discount on a meal for 2, i had the prawns with chilis wok vegetables and pork dumplingspotstickers it was all excellent but a little bit expensive i understand that the dish to order here is the peking duck and you must do it in advance, we had the roast duck and a selection of appetizers we had never had the crispy duck skin seasoned with sugar before what a decadent treat i think the 20 year old chinese yellow rice wine must be an acquired taste when we steeped ginger and palm sugar in the wine we enjoyed it more, we have stayed at the hyatt on the bund several times each visit we must dine in xindalu for their pecking duck it is the best duck we have ever tasted

you must make reservation for duck ahead of time

after carving of duck table side the duck is cut into three portions first the skin which you dip into a small dish of sugar it is delicious they prepare the second portion which is breast meat and then the dark meat they also provide a hoisin type sauce and a spicy garlic butter sauce although we have never been a fan of the spicy garlic sauce the hoisin sauce on the other hand was delicious

added to eat with the duck is sliced thin cucumbers and onions with thin pancakes to wrap in

we also had spring rolls as appetizer for the table the were freshly fried and crispy they came with a side of rice vinegar for dipping i personally liked the vinegar tasted with them however others at the table did not

drinks we fine as we had coke light and waters

when in shanghai enjoy the duck here, there were mixed reviews of this place but they were weighted to the high end and my wife and i thought wed risk a visit we took it as a good sign that they only had seats available at 830 pm this suggested many people wanted to eat there which bode well when we arrived at the restaurant it was only about 20 full and soon we found out why we started with an appetizer of pork in sesame sauce over thick bean sheet noodles tasty but no more than we ordered a green beans with ground pork in bean sauce with chilis b deep fried pork ribs and c deep fried chicken with chilis
a the green beans were a fair rendition of a well known dish they might have been seared a bit more from the vesuvian heat of the wok and the sauce might have been a bit more assertive but still it was good not great b the pork ribs were beneath a pile of something dont know what looked like sesame seeds but it wasnt but heres the point the sauce or sand pile was tasteless it was like eating rather meatless ribs with a hint of porky flavor your average middle school home economics class can dish better than this the fact that this dish cost $2300 was utterly galling and for this you got 6 small ribs this was an audacious ripoff of the first degree a moral crime a felony in the united states at least though no one batted an eye here c the deep fried chicken with chilis amounted to boneless bits of meat some with nubbins of bone still attached just enough to kindle fear in a simple sauce that i think was mainly soy sauce certainly nothing inspiring wonderful revelatory this was your average bachelors stir fry with just a hint of dread
we had a tasty rose at a reasonable price about $4000 the rice was slightly overcooked the service was inattentive had to wave the waitstaff down for service the overall bill was $14000 which means that the food was about $10000
im terribly sorry to say this place is a joke if you go there the jokes on you, without reservation  we asked for a peking duck roast in the cheminea 
food was amazing and service five star
wine selection is correct of course  you pay the price but for a great memory, this is a particularly fine peking duck its certainly the dish of choice here and if you dont order one when you reserve its an hour wait they serve it in 3 courses first with skin to be dipped in sugar second the plain meat with a strong garlic sauce and then the skin edged meat to wrap in the thinnest of pancakes with hoisin sauce and julienned cucumber and onions beautiful to watch the chef carve and absolutely succulent the half duck is plenty for twothree
the kung pao prawns is another delicious specialty as is the bean curd with porcini mushrooms lovely setting foreigner friendly, the xindalu is conveniently located in the hyatt on the bund the food is very nice and the service correct, if you ignore the noises kids make at nearby tables this could be fine dining anywhere in the world their peking duck is to die for cooked in a woodfired stove apple wood to perfection then carved at the table divvied up into 3 platters crispy skin breast meat and dark meat waiter explained each platter is best eaten with respectively sugar garlicky melted butter and hoisin sauce also served with fresh julienned cucumber to go with the spring onion inside the pancake best peking duck ive ever had without a doubt

also had wonderful spring rolls where the rolls were made of tofu these were tasty tiny creations a wonderful surprise, the restaurant is not specactular but a good choice as the quality of the food is good if you stay in the hotel and dont want to walk outside you can go there, went to this place with high expectations came back disappointed
service friendly but v unfocused rather confused they start serving condiments of peking duck to us without having that order from us
it takes far too long time to get served even straightforward orders

they charge european high bracket prices but don�t deliver corresponding quality
shrimps  45
cod � 35
chicken � 35
spicy australian beef was indeed hot since it was forewarned none of their fault however if u r not into exaggeratedly hot food � wouldn�t recommend it thus no grading

in short u can get far better food for less money in shanghai, while staying at hyatt decided to have a dinner alone one night

did not feel welcome or attended too i wasnt attended by someone who could converse in english which was rather surprising since even the hyatt staff at breakfast area spoke english to a good degree

so mistakenly ordered some shrimps they turned out with the shell which i do not eat but got billed for it

then was advised to order another dish with king prawns they were ok nothing exotic

so with some prawns and a glass of wine paid about 477yuan and left hungry 
but still got charged, i hate to be that guy who gives a one star review on a reason that is somewhat order dependent because the food was 36 star quality on par with a pf changs but i feel i have ample reason to give this restaurant one star

1 i ordered a dish that was described as having abalone chestnuts and chicken wings listed in this order for almost 300 yuan including their service charge

the problem was that for the 15 chicken wings i received i received only 2 abalone and my lord those chicken wings were a chore to eat it was about 7090 bone ffs

does anybody outside asia enjoy eating foods that are over 70 bone i feel that item should be taken off the english menu

so i felt for a lack of a better word that i was robbed while i expected to get a bunch of abalone i got a bunch of chicken wings that were impossible to eat negotiating around all those little bones was very frustrating


2 the service was lazy and disrespectful
there were only 23 tables that had customers and there were 23 workers doing nothing after they served my food it was like i didnt exist

it is not my job to ask you to refill my water shanghai is a first world city with first world prices 400 yuan for a 2 course meal with no drinks where one expects first world service  your job is so simple and with so few tasks any person over a 60 iq could do it so obviously its laziness and disrespect i understand you rather talk to your coworker for the entire time while you pretend im invisible but imagine for within those 45 minutes you neglected me you spent 30 seconds and acknowledged my existence you could have exponentially increased your level of service

in conclusion i am very angry for what i experienced and have regrets for trusting the hyatt to house a legitimate restaurant

one could easily get a better meal and much better service without getting mislead for 3x less in many places around the world

there is nothing exotic or special about this restaurant its just an overpriced pf changs that treats you with disrespect

oh and btw i am still hungry looks like i need to find another restaurant tonight, this is the best pecking duck ive eaten to date i tried the pecking duck at the hyatt in hong kong a few years back and it was mind blowing so i had high expectations coming to xindalu i was certainly not disappointed

while we waited for the duck to roast in their special wooden oven we had some some sweet and spicy pork to share as well as a steamed whole fish they were both fresh tasty and incredibly well prepared then when the duck was ready they brought it table side where they cut it up and served it directly it was so crispy on the outside yet moist in the inside masterful finally we had sesame ice cream for dessert which was also very delicious

overall great restaurant with an enticing menu and fresh preparations of classic chinese food

if you want to try this delightful dish let the restaurant know youll be having the pecking duck when youre making the reservation, in the hyatt good location very good food spicy shrimp vg duck rolls also vg spicy chick tasty service was slow and unorganized so be a little patient ordering wine takes time as it comes from the 32 floor they tell u that, if you like peking duck beijing duck this restaurant is one of my favorites with its gallery kitchen which makes me feel good about food preparation i also the shredded mushroom salad and the wok friend beef with chilis the service is outstanding but it can be difficult to get in same night so call ahead, very nice restaurant at the hyatt bund it offers a nice open kitchen concept which provides a bit of dinning entertainment order ahead for beggars chicken and pekin duck service was very good with dishes coming out quickly waiter suggested waiting to order to see if we really wanted another dish which worked well and saved some money as we did not over order, best peking duck by far very carefully prepared and carved table side by one of the chefs love the shanghainese noodles also weve eaten here many times never disappointed, we met colleagues here for lunch while in shanghai this week in short the food and service were amazing here our host had called ahead to order the peking duck and we also had a selection of other dishes with it everything was fresh and very well prepared the peking duck was spectacular beautiful restaurant and hotel near the bund, i spent almost one week in the hotel hyatt on the bund therefore i had the opportunity to have my dinner in this nice restaurant
at first the personnel is kind and available if they dont speak english they apologize with a smile and they call some colleague
the kitchen is visible to the customers and you can enjoy the cookers preparing your meal
food is really good i loved their potsticker pork dumpling
excellent, the menu at the restaurant is heavily shanghai cuisine which i love and loved however peking duck is their specialty and i highly recommend it the restaurant is on the first floor so theres no view over the bund i really liked its lowkey atmosphere and open kitchen youll have free wifi though you do need to provide your cell phone number chinese or international in order to get a validation code before you sign on  a pretty painless process, had heard a lot about the hyatt on the bunds iconic xindalu beijing duck restaurant and decided to try it for a celebration dinner the food overall was excellent with a duck almost as good as that served in the beijing grand hyatts made in china which is tops for me in the duck stakes the lobster we ordered and simpler vegetable offerings were all very good too but the service was a big disappointment a 30 minute delay to get two draft beers which were supposed to be on promotion was followed by haphazard and indifferent service throughout the meal noone knew what was going on everyone had to speak to someone else it took forever to get dome dishes and the sequencing was bizarre and it was not even as though the restaurant was desperately busy clearly time for some attention on team training and supervision, this is still my favorite place for peking duck every time i visit shanghai you have to book in advance if you want to get the duck so that it is prepared for you when you arrive the chef will come to the table and go trough the works of separating skin and meat  service is attentive and they serve at late hours considering china, we had dinner at the xindalu chinese restaurant while staying at the hyatt and it was excellent the dinner was last minute and i was sad that you had to order the bejing duck in advance but instead had the crispy duck along with some dim sum and loved it my colleagues had some pork and fried rice dishes and enjoyed their dinners as well great drink selection too  we had a great time, we wanted to have an easy lunch at the hotel since we were plagued with jet lag since we loved the pork pyramid in the hyatt in hangzhou so much we ordered it here just for the good memories luckily it was available without preordering so we were happy to find it here nice presentation and taste
the beef noodle soup was very fatty but great taste and the lotus appetizer we ordered a little underwhelming regarding the spices as mentioned by other reviewers the prices are very high the staff was not very attentive and that is unusual for the hyatt standard
so it was just ok for our purpose this time but we if we had more energy i would have gone elsewhere, done in the traditional way the beijing duck is done here in traditional hoven  and is one of the best in town 
the rest of the dishes are excellent  especially all dishes around pork  like this amazing pyramid of sliced pork","Healthy",0.857042842260255
68,"this is there a bit more upscale for this hotel and it is reflected in the menu options and the food prices i had the lobster and shrimp soup and shared a hamburger it was a good meal in a fine atmosphere, stayed two nights on business and was allocated a room on the 53rd floor called elite floor the room was a standard corporate size but what made it much better was
1 very clean
2 vey well appointed lots of electrical sockets good lighting documentation and stationery in leather folders etc
3 well above standard minibar and teacoffee facilities

but better than all that
4 the room gave access to the executive suite on the 59th floor outstanding complimentary breakfast complimentary afternoon tea complimentary evening cocktails and hors doeuvres the latter very understated  one could eat a very good multicourse dinner here
5 attentive welcoming and efficient reception staff
6 smiling staff at each turn

i understand the hotel is to have a renovation in my view there is little need  it is and has everything that a midprice downtown hotel requires to satisfy a welltravelled client

well done, i dined here twice during the week i stayed at the hotel

the first visit was in a large group and the second was just three of us

the staff are professional and friendly and the food is good quality with generous portions you can expect all the standard western grill items here steaks chops and a very decent burger on offer

sides are delicious i tried the creamed spinach and it was delicious, compare to the other top notch steakhousei do like mortons the ribeye was very chewy and lack of flavor here the mash potato was even the worst ive ever tried i was wondering someone should have asked us how the meal went unfortunately it seems no one cares service was not well trained up we left with a few broken hearts, nine days at the j w marriott on business heavy rain when we arrived and our room window on the 46th floor was leaking  no fuss at all the fantastic maria on the concierge desk moved us the next morning to a vastly upgraded room and took good care of my wife whilst i travelled away three days including a birthday cake for her really faultless service executive floor staff very good housekeeping could not have done more will definitely stay when i return in october, this was my second time going to the ws california grill
wanted to surprise my family with some good western food in shanghai and was the best option

the restaurant is at jw marriot in people<u+00b4>s squeare and the views are just amazing you can see the shole shanghai from there it is a good pace if you want to impress someone

the food was really good we had a great t bone it was just perfectly cooked and melting on our mouths it is the best t bne pace i know in shanghai they are quite specialized on that
we also ordered some foie as entree and was amazing the presentation of the dish was perfect and every detail was a plus on the dish
my dad loves wines and the wine selection they had was really good he loved that
attached some pictures sorry for the quality was taken from my phone

the service was perfect all the time all waiters had an eye on us and everyone at the room

of course it is not a cheap option but totally worth to bring anyone there it really is a place to impress people

i am really happy to have brought my faminly there because they loved it
it was my second time and will not be the last one for sure

highly recommendeed, this jw marriott is top high class top l beautiful view of shanghai
the service is professional and food is very nice
the lounge room service is ok lack of kind heart
the staff are professional again not with kind heart towards chinese facial peoplesome of staff even speak shanghainess diallog , great food and great service 3 friends had dinner here recommend half lobster half meatsteak it is also a great opportunity to enjoying twin light view of peoples square and peoples park from 40th floor where the restaurant is when you are dinning in early evening, if youre craving some american cuisine then this place will hit the spot

highly rated steak good burgers and chips menu is somewhat limited to these sorts of items but if thats what youre after what difference does it make

its on the pricey side when compared to getting that same meal from a restaurant in less sophisticated surrounds as that of the jw marriott good for those staying at the hotel, after a long day of sightseeing we went back to the jw where we were staying and wanted to grab dinner we didnt have reservations and were dressed in shorts and tshirts but that wasnt a problem they sat us promptly

the service and the meal were outstanding it was a great way to end the day and being able to have an excellent meal in out hotel was great i would recommend it, excellent service good food and lots of western options i enjoyed it although its pricey decent wine selection, i had an excellent meal here for a weekend lunch the whitefish i had was perfectly cooked very tasty and accompanied by a delicious tomato sauce but the environment is really strange the entrance to the restaurant looks like what is left of a restaurant that used to be there is stuff there that should be stored not up to the standard of a restaurant i would expect in a jw marriott, the 40 floor view was great  the staff was very warm and super professionalthe make the very nice prepared cake and flower for my friend birthdayoyster super freshtomahawk is hugei think 1kg is enough sharing for 3, wine list needs some workno imagination or great wines and higher prices then needed for what they put into the wine list steak was good sent it back as it came out super rare when i ordered it med rare but they fixed it and it was really good views are nice on the window tables service was good and overall it was ok but not anything special or memorable for the money spent, the view from the 40th floor is supposed to be good but unfortunately it was a cloudy and overcast day

service was friendly yet professional and the staff stopped by a couple of times to chat and to check on the meal

i had the qingdao beef as my main course and i followed the waiters recommendation to have the meat cooked medium as he said medium well would make the meat too hard i had two generous pieces which were well presented  both were tasty though one piece had a bit of fatgristle

you help yourself to the salad bar which also featured plates of smoked salmon turkey pastrami and mixed vegetables you can also slice your selected breads which were fresh but i would have preferred them to be a little more crusty there is also a choice of herb butter recommended and ordinary butter

for dessert they had a choice of over 5 items including an apple tart with a strange greenish top which i found a tad sweet i enjoyed the berry pie as well as japanese cheese slice

i ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc i think it was torres 2014 for 55 rmb  it was rather tart and much too young and perhaps should not have been in the drinks menu, dinner at the jws california grill exceeded expectations chef joan has a beautifully orchestrated menu and combined with his vibrant and welcoming personality made for a perfect culinary experience

the quality of ingredients were impeccable and the presentations per dish were executed with great passion especially the main course

to complete the entire experience the wait staff was friendly attentive and professional, excellent food in very pleasant surrounding with incredible views attentive staff everything you would expect at a jw marriott, it is a very nice place to meet up with friends no kids though as kids running around would really bother others and business partners and of course family
the service is wonderful no matter you have a waiter or waitress more waiters than waitresses
the environment is great
the food is wonderful we love the salad bar with grilled asparagas eggplants and scallop salads all dishes are good but i love the lamb chops and the lobsters most beef steak is quite fine as wel, we had a great lunch which is a combination of a buffet with a selection of main course i had the sea bream with was very good and otters shad meat also very good there is a selection of meats and salads to start with but you can also select soup and there was also a section of two i had the chicken broth with asparagusexcellent
great views also good service and good value, i had a weekend with friends to dinner they just get a new menu they manager to help me introduce some new dishes good taste service is also great, the price for the steaks are very reasonable the rib eye prime rib to be the best in shanghai served with peppercorn sauce the manager has a good sense of hospitality and knows very well what the customer needs its near people square so i would say the traffic is the most convenient
good wine list with value for money californian wines, we had a super nice dinner here last night 350 rmb for a 500g qualified steak from australia im sure nothing could make better deal than this in shanghai all starters are yummy and reasonaly priced too service was a little slow and not as professional as mortons but they all smiling on you and attentive im sure we will be back often, i just had dinner last night here the steak was just to die for and service with charm and helpful the restaurant set up is so beautiful and traffic was convenient like the dessert very much price range here is reasonable
will come back, i have stayed in this hotel last year they messed up my room type then upgraded me i understand this occasion happens in hotels all the time however this time i was totally shocked by the service in the lounge bar upstairs
we walked in to the bar to have a drink after dinner the waiter didn�t smile at all when he took the order which is understandable maybe he just had a tough day then it came to the drinks wine  wine glass plus beer  glass all in his hands it reminds me of a cheap barclub how come there�s no tray i�m not a professional waiter however i think the way he poured out the wine is quite strange again there�s no smile or �enjoy your drink� sort of thing

there are 4 to 5 waiterswaitress in the bar maybe it�s the reason why they are not busy and making phone callsleaning on the bar see the pics as below maybe i have high expectations but i don�t think this is 5 star hotel standard not even talk about this is a premium brand for marriott
it seems that there�s no smoking areanone smoking area in this bar guests could smoke everywhere in the bar which is quite disturbing
i don�t recommend this bar if you already had experience in other international 5 star hotels, i have to say its kind of funny go all the way to shanghai only to eat at a california cuisine restaurant especially since i live in los angeles

there was nothing terribly unique or notable about the meal but it did taste great it was actually what you would expect at nice restaurant in california and very familiar so kudos for the chef on nailing california cuisine i had the salmon with roasted potatoes and asparagus both are sides you have to order separately which makes it an expensive dinner wine selections were good and the waiters recommended choice was of course a california red wine  which was very good it was a beringer cabernet  very smooth

the service at the california grill was topnotch the staff was very polite and consistently prompt with their service

considering its on the 40th floor there really wasnt a dramatic view unless you had a table for two  those were located right next to the windows what surprised me was how little use the architects who designed the hotelrestaurant made little access of the view  windows were small and few

go for the great service good food and convenience of a nice restaurant if you are staying in the hotel i wouldnt go out of my way if i was staying somewhere else and nor should you go if you are hoping for an amazing view, this seems to be a small space carved out on the hotels 40th floor the restaurants food is much better than its atmosphere it is separated by a very large elevator lobby from the evening jws lounge which is really a bar i had chilean seabass which was prepared very well its preceded by a serve yourself salad bar and desserts at the end the price is not bad but i would advise you to eat at a fine restaurant in shanghai instead, excellent ny strip steak with a fine argentinian malbec great food service and view of downtown shanghai exec chef rene definitely knows how to run a restaurant no problem with smoke from the adjacent bar  it is in a completely separate section of the building recommended, did not like the fact that the loungebar part of the restaurant is a smokerscigar bar restaurant food and service was good but cant make up for the smoking next to the restaurant, nice place good crowd and food was fair  service was fast and the staff was nice i liked the location, had a fantastic sunday brunch at this restaurant fantastic selection of seafood and australian beef usual free flow wine and beer supplemented by margaritas staff were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble there are a huge number of brunches on offer in shanghai this is one of the best, this restaurant is inside the jw marriot hotel
i ordered a small steak that was good enough but not juicy at all together with the steak i ordered a baked potato it was not very good and the socalled butter was instead some kind of poor cream i did not like it
at the end of the dinner they served 3 biscuits able to break your teeth my recommendation is not to try them
more than 500 rmb for that, i went here for decent steak i got very friendly welcome from the waitresses they explained the menu and differences of the meat carefully i selected 250 grams tenderloin with oven potato steak cost 488 renminbi side dish added almost 50 rmb steak was ordered as medium rare but to me it was medium slightly over done in any case meat quality was very high

food prices are not low this applies to wine as well restaurant was rather rather empty when i ate there its a decent hotel restaurant with great views i could eat here again, i had been here a few years ago since then i always considered this restaurant the one where i had the best steack in my life so i decided to come back a try another memorable experience with a steak
probably somenthing has changed since then meat quality doesnt look like the same anymore prices increased very close to be unacceptable meat is good although not unfotgettable and similar to other good steackhouses

service is good and vew astonishing but the restaurant has become another very expensive not worth to come for an excellent meat at a good price, a nice mix of western and chinese food i went for lunch and there was a very nice menu mixed with an appetizer and dessert buffet, ate dinner here with tired kids because we needed an easy meal would recommend going elsewhere if you have any energy but this is a good choice for tired travelers, the steaks at the jw california grill are really good juicy and tender imported pieces of heaven i would highly recommend the steaks the service and decoration are also really good the only problem is that its expensive and hotels add 15 on top of the price its pricier than other nonhotel restaurants in the city but we were staying at jw marriott so we also save on cab money , it is a nice place to have dinner after long day of work it was expensive with limited choices but overall it is a great convenience if you are tired and can not go out, the restaurant is located on the 40th floor of the jw marriott hotel and has a very good selection of western food i opted for a steak since i had been in china for 3 weeks and wanted some western food the prices are a bit more expensive than if you were to eat at a restaurant outside of the hotel but the quality of the food was worth the price i did not drink any wine but i checked out the wine list and they seemed to have a very good selection, we had dinner twice in this beautiful restaurantbar the food is amazing and they have a great selection of wines
of course it is not cheap but what would you expect in such a beautiful place with such a good food
will be back during our next trip in shanghai, a restaurant that gives attention to your needs is the one which is the best according to me the service given by the staff here was exemplary in addition to the delicious food cooked by the chef, my husband and i were brainstorming for a place to take our 2 valuable business guests from holland for lunch and decided to give the california grill a try after reading some great reviews here our guests are picky with the quality of food and services or restaurants so hubby and i were very pleased that our guests were impressed by the excellent food and the very thoughtful and professional service rendered to us

i ordered the veal topped with buttered breadcrumbs and it was done to perfection our guests ordered the lamb which looked just as tantalizing ill try that next time for sure the starters buffet was beautifully presented with a nice selection of seafood bites and cold cuts i would say there is no question about the quality of the food in this restaurant the portion of my main course was a little too much for me however on my next visit i will definitely pace myself at the starter course

i must say however the interior decor of the restaurant isnt as contemporary as the other newer hotel restaurants in shanghai but well the view from that 40th floor right at the city centre of shanghai more than made up for it

what we also appreciate was the professionalism of the service staff they were attentive but at the same time gave us space when they saw that we were deeply engaged in our discussions

we will most definitely return when we get the chance and recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a great afternoon of excellent food and good service with a breathtaking view of this city, my husband wanted to take me to a nice valentines day dinner in shanghai western food has always been a disappointment in shanghai so i was on the fence especially the fact we went from california to shanghai to eat at the california grill is just kind of funny but my husband convince me to go for the view which did turn out to be gorgeous the food was ok too dont expect anything spectacular here but what they did have they did a decent job no disastrous over cooked scallop like we had at the portsman ritz carlton we had oysters beef tartar salmon prawn and grill asparagus the oyster was good beef tartar has a bit too much caper and asparagus was a bit too salty but they did cook the asparagus again for me and it was good the second time around my husband said his salmon was excellent but you knowi can make the same salmon my prawn dish didnt have the most fresh prawn so it was just ok the manager at the restaurant was very nice and took the critiques very well so hopefully they can improve on the food some more we told him about our bad experience at the ritz carlton and he said he will make sure to send the feedbacks since they are the same company he also told me hotel business is tough in shanghai so they really appreciate all the feedback so i would give 5 star for the service and 3 star for the food seriously dont expect very good food just ok food but a great view and nice staff, attracted by the thought of roast turkey but opted for veal chop instead outstanding service ok nice choice of desserts, the california grill restaurant is located on the 40th floor of the jw marriott hotel and has a great view of the city the food was fresh and tasty and the service was ok but the atmosphere was a little bit wierd because the restaurant was empty it was only us and another family prices are a expensive but hey youre eating in the marriotts luxury brand, i has the buffet  the food was very good and a very large variety  service was good also  but this was not cheap 

if value is not an issue this is a very good place to eat  and the view is outstanding , we went upto the grill at about 6 pm and choose a good table had a full view of shanghai skyline dinner was excellent the sun went down and the lights came up was beautiful to see the sunset and city at nite, mainly used by hotel guests understandably but nonetheless great food and service a little on the pricey side and i understand they have raised prices since i was there but a great restaurant for a hotel","Mexican cuisine",0.740951541194234
69,"food is good actually very solid quality
nothing you would write home about
whats special in this place is the stunning view and this view outshines the fooddrinksservice my happiness bottom line of my visit was overall very good i would recommend this restaurant for people who care for an overall experience rather than visitors who seeking a kick about the dinner itself, perfect location i come back after two years and e everything was perfect as well
service perfect
starter and pizza awesome also fried calamari  staff always very friendly and efficient, i had a fanastic lunch here great views of the river and food was terrific they have a set lunch for 128rmb that included your choice of appetizer pizza or pasta sorbet and fruit and coffee or tea perfect, with an operation on the podong side of shanghai step one is finding places to eat ive been going to the kitchen for years real good continental style but the view of downtown shanghai and the bund is spectacular nice western wine selection too, what most impressed me about this place was their observation and initiative

first when they came to clear our table they asked if everything was okay with my meal when they noticed that i had only eaten half of my spaghetti i didnt finish because i was full and got the rest togo but im assuming they probably wouldve done something about it if i had said that i didnt like it not all waiters would notice andor ask and it is nice when they do

then when my friend ordered an iced tea because she didnt like the cocktail that she ordered the waiter proactively offered to comp her ice tea and dessert at the end of the meal even though she made no complaints and wasnt expecting any sort of comp after sending her drink back this is the kind of service that builds loyalty among customers

i will not only be a repeat visitor but i will also recommend it to both locals and visitors to shanghai quality italian food in a laid back atmosphere that has amazing views of huangpu river with floortoceiling windows and amazingly attentive service, service is mediaocre prices rather high but the location makes up for it extensive menu good wine selection terrace right by the river, after having chinese food for a week i really wanted to have a italian diner
we sat outside and view on the river was amazing
the food was perfect i had a salad as a starter which was really nice
as a main course i had a pizza which was delicious

as a desert i had a tiramisu

the wine was also excellent

will definitely come back here on my next visit to shanghai, this restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it did not disappoint after a steady diet of chinese food we were looking for a good italian alternative the food and atmosphere was spectacular with an outdoor patio overlooking the waterfront the entrance was a little difficult to locate and our cab driver actually dropped us off at the wrong location but once there it was worth the confusion the restaurant is actually within reasonable walking distance of the shanghi eye and tv tower which makes it a great place for dinner after some downtown sightseeing, great location great food good servicei simply love the pizza there eversince i visited first time 9 years ago, i usually eat there twice a year i went a few times last spring though i am in love with this place the surrounding and of course the amazing view on the river and the bund just across the huangpu either you sit inside or outside you can enjoy it the place is a bit pricey but the wine is good the food is always good and generous size
if you are looking for a great place on the pudong side please try it thats what i usually tell my friends, ocopus as a starter and grilled seafish as the main course thats what i took i had it accompanied by glasses of white wine sitting outside we enjoyed the great view on the river and bunt skyline i loved the food and the service was exelllent too thanks again salvatore crew for the wondeful evening, im italian and for me is the best pizza in shanghai its a little bit expensive restaurant but the food is really tasty hight level quality good service and amazing location the perfect place for a romantic dinner, beautiful setting with great buzz about it staff very friendly freshly cooked pizza and pasta yhummmmy good price too ate outside best booking as gets busy, the food is overall very good i tried the meat sampler appetizer and it had a excellent selection of cold cut meats the wagyu steak was superb and was absolutely moist and tender each bite better than the previous, my title says it allpicturesque setting on the water overlooking the bund

lovely openkitchen concept and great atmosphere

pizzas delicious and pasta also i ordered a side salad  not on the menu  and it was no problem

wine lovely and cold and good selection

pudding  chocolate molten cake thing  delicious

overall worth a visit try and visit on a dry day and sit outside on terrace, foods were more than good atmosphere was very relaxing since they are located right at the riverside service were very professional with good english proficiency
i had a business dinner and we all were so happy and enjoyed the evening a lot
they have good list of wines and serve quite properly with good glasses
i guess during good seasons in shanghai i will definitely go back there soon, located behind the pearl tower the location is perfect ad easy accessible by metro great italian food i had the homemade ravioli with eggplant starters were very good the big surprise came with desserts we ordered a selection of desserts it came beautifully presented and nine samples of their desserts a perfect finish for a great dinner with friends, looking for somewhere to have dinner with clients and wanting to eat european food i recalled having visited this place several years ago i can honestly say that the standards have been upheld whilst the location on the river remains as amazing and impressive as ever, very good italian food as an italian i can say its one of the few restaurants outside italy where food really respect the italian style i love their pasta with lobster above all theyve a lovely space to have dinner al fresco with a good view, the kitchens modern decor jazzy music and splendid views of the bund enhance the experience at this top notch restaurant

the friendly staff are attentive and professional the food however remains the reason i try to visit the kitchen whenever i am in shanghai although a bit on the pricey side the food and portions are well worth the money

i may vary my entree  tried a pizza for the first time today excellent but my goto appetizer is the pumpkin soup also you cant go wrong with any of the desserts i however am a huge fan of the chocolate tortina deliziosa, the kitchen offered us a wonderful pizza margharite along with pasta dishes that were delicious the ambiance and views from this restaurant in pudong was wonderful
they helped with a taxi for us to get home as well we will go again, fabulous view across to the bund good attentive service delicious food quite expensive though  around rmb300 for a main meal, first when a restaurant calls you because you inadvertently let your business cards on the floor you know they mean client attention it was a great service with attention to details and to the tables
the food of salvatore cuomo was remarkable the quality of the ingredients the accommodation of the dishes and the sauces combined to create savory dishes that we enjoyed
the view to the bund from the river was spectacular
i will return, i chose this place for its outdoor seating with a great view over the huangpu river and the bund the cesar salad i had as a starter was quite ok and came in a large portion after a good pizza i was pleased with a decent meal in a great location, i dont know where to start guess ill start with getting sick the food made both my wife and i very ill well into the night our dining couple had pizzas which they said were good but i cannot vouch for the effects

service

service was poor at best wait staff congregating and chatted most of the time every time we had to initiate service and were not proactively asked my chicken dish came out last when others at the table were more than half finished the change from our bill took 15min and only came out when i asked where it was the place was not crowded and its not a big place

environment

this is the only area where this venue excels it has nice outdoor seating and nice views of the huangpu river

food

the chicken was billed as spicy but beyond having 2 red chili peppers draped over the chicken it was extremely bland and was also extremely oily on top of that my wifes risotto came in a portion that was a joke our dining partners pizzas looked good and they told us they tasted good as well

all this wrapped up in a very pricey bill expected to pay top dollar for a venue like this but was not even close to delivering on food and service i will never be coming here again, had a lovely lunch here off the set lunch menu  4 or 5 choices per course really nice food fair prices but not cheap  all round a good spot to go to, food is always consistently good but the view of the bund and around is breathtaking very good place to entertain outoftown clients hard to park around here, delicious dinner and amazing venue selected italian products and ingredients
i had a dinner with 4 italian colleagues and we all agreed about the food quality
of course the setting and the service will be charged this was the most expensive italian restaurant in my 4 weeks visit in shanghai, simply to say this is the best pizza in shanghai  view is also great although restaurant is a little tight if you have a lot of people for your business dinner, cozy location by the river overlooking the bund
great pizzas from woodfired oven inside the restaurant
nice for both couples and business dinner or lunch, the kitchen is where hub brings colleagues and clients to if they decide to eat italian occasionally we dine there with friends too when the weather permits dining out by the river is a lovely experience and the food is usually good i usually take the wagyu beef and hub the lobster with efficient service and a good selection of wines in the week they have a lunch menu that include pizzas and pastas and you can see the cooks working in the kitchen as you eat, this place has everything you want  great food right in the water in pudong overlooking the bund definitely start with a pizza and then it is all good from there, the restaurant is very nice and you can see how they cook the view is good to the river but for me it is not the best in shanghai for summer they have very nice terrace
service is very good and attentive always careful for your needs
food is good but i have eaten in italian restaurants better for half the price
i asked for beef carpaccio as starter and pasta with pumpkin and meat in the carpaccio they put lot of arugula to fill the dish not needed in a good carpaccio and the beef was good but i have tested better for the pasta it was too thick and even when it was good i think the price was too high fr what the dish had for that price you can buy lot of pumpkin and minced meat i also tasted fried squid from one colleague and they were nothing special in my home town you can eat better ones in any tapas bar for 3� average price for starters is around 140 rmb and for pasta more or less the same, ambience location interior are very pleasant service excellent and very attentive with a larger group for dinner a preselected 5 course meal was served with perfect timing  every dish was delicious hot fresh and very well presented choices of wines complementing the dinner were also excellent with very good variety i would definitely return as a couple to entartain friends or a business group, located near the pearl tower its hidden in the park overlooking the river the glass building makes for great views of the bund this was a business lunch so we went with the set menu there are three choices  one includes the additional pizzapasta dish and the other a desert the salad starter was good as was the grilled cod main course these are not huge portions by any means so in a group it may be worth getting the extra course and sharing the pizza the price was reasonable and it was fine for a light lunch the views must be terrific at night for a romantic dinner, had a great meal here a few years ago and was anxious to return and see if it was still great since i was alone i sat at the bar enjoyed a couple of beers the young entertainers playing guitar and singing and the pizza chef slinging pies in and out of the oven the beer battered shrimp calamari  zucchini were hot crispy and full of flavour the molten chocolate tart and vanilla ice cream were wonderful the kitchen certainly lived up to my memories  including the challenge of finding it in the shadow of the pearl tower, after visiting the kitchen salvatore im disappointed that it took us so long to find this restaurant the local listings smartshanghai timeout cityweekend certainly dont give this place the credit it deserves the space is modern and the service impeccable great views throughout the restaurant of the open kitchen and bund starters mains and deserts all came out efficiently and with the correct pacing the salumi on the starter was generous and amazing quality and the pasta dishes were served with an appropriate amount of cheese ie not swimming in it and a rarity in china the white wine actually came out at the correct temperature give this place a try if youre looking for quality italian in shanghai, great italian food restaurant with consistently high quality food have been coming there for years and the reason for the repeat visits is that i have never been disappointed wood fire cooked pizza pasta excellent a winner consistently , it was a nice break from chinese food but i didnt feel this restaurant lived up to all the great reviews well it was good but it wasnt extraordinary

lovely service and welcome from donna and the staff were very competent and spoke excellent english

parma ham with melon and buffala mozerella didnt actually come with the mozerella  we were told this only after we asked where it was  apparently china is out of mozerella until next month bread salad was just a salad with some triangles of bread placed on top  nothing like a real bread salad fried seafood starter was good but quite heavy on the batter

main course of steak was excellent gnocchi with seafood was average with not a lot of seafood pizza was good tirimisu was very competent

overall a good restaurant but i wouldnt say it was spectacular, the outdoor dining deck is certainly a plus especially considering the beautiful view over the bund we also liked the open kitchen inside the restaurant
service is warm good and attentive
quality of the dishes is good but i would say average if compared to other italian restaurants in shanghai prices are much higher than average but i guess you pay for the location and atmosphere, we came with a friend and was treated by a warm and chatty atmosphere a beautiful restaurant bustling with people we sat down and ordered the food while looking out the window directly facing the shanghai tv tower looming over us its lights flashing in the night i ordered beef carpaccio with truffle sauce as an appetiser and it was great the beef was thick but tender and melted the way a thin slice would it was not the best carpaccio i ever had yet the quality of the beef was by far the best main course was cod cod cooked neapolitan style and when it came up my father said it was difficult to cook cod that well in this style it tasted great after that we got a margherita pizza and was probably the best i ever had out of all the pizzas i had i will never forget this amazing experience the professional cooking and unbelievably kind staff made my day the vegetarian food there is also excellent i certainly recommend this for anyone words cannot describe how staggering this place is, the lunch menu is pricefix and a little expensive but the food service and setting are excellent, well  so sad bcz i had a uncooked pasta and when i complain the refry my dish an serve back  i am a professional chef educated and live in north italy and i know when my past is uncooked or not  never had so disappoint from a italian restaurant in shanghai  never going back again, what a pleasure to once again confirm the superb quality of the restaurant the kitchen among the best italian restaurants ive ever tried around the world excellent pasta pizza wonderful unforgettable desserts added to this is the excellent wine list the location and the kindness and professionalism of the staff a special thanks to rosalba a welcome beauty and sympathy
fabio, friends took me here and i really enjoyed the outdoor dining wait staff was friendly and attentive and the food was really good the decor was very modern and warm

we shared a pizza as an app and had beef tenderloin for my main meal both were delicious but honestly i could have eaten that whole pizza by myself as a main dish

bonus was the great view of the city sitting on the river watching the boats go by got an unexpected surprise of a full fireworks show not 100 yards offshore on a barge

if i had to make one complaint and it has nothing to do with the establishment it would be that our taxi driver had no idea where he was going and stopped twice to look at a mapa little scary when neither of us speak each others languages it all worked out in the end  

will definitely be back, i was first introduced to the kitchen by a business associate who italian national living in china for the last eight years his claim is that this is the most authentic italian restaurants in shanghai
i have been there many times and have found almost everything on their menu delicious from the prosciutto to the pizza to the pasta to the fish the restaurant has a western feel and the view overlooking the river is great however as other reviewers have stated it is a little pricey, welcomed by the italian owner to set the tone of this place she suggested we start with pizzas woodfired oven to share among everyone  good pizza but not the best the other food we ate in this restaurant was excellent each different fish in the mixed grill was cooked to perfection the risotto was just right all dishes had their own unique flavours and were well presented deserts were perfect and beautifully presented prices western food western prices

tableware sparkling a busy restaurant reservation recommended with the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant restaurant walls are glass to provide an uninterrupted view of the surroundings  spectacular seating also available on an outside terrace near the water

service and staff friendly and efficient, note i went during the wine week so we had a three course meal for about cny220 each incl 6 small glasses of wine this of course makes me very positive of the value for money
the deal was appetizer pasta 2choices main sirloin or cod dessert and 6 different glasses of wine
we were seated outdoors with a very good view service during the dinner was okay decently trained but no warmth and need to learn to be a bit smoother and smiling
appetizer was fine salmon etc not remarkable but okay taste very simple dish also
pasta with seafood was pretty good again solid but not remarkable
i had the sirloin very nice meat perfectly cooked and good quality meat i liked it a lot but a bit too simple a dish just a piece of meat and not much else i tasted the cod as well and it was okay
dessert was ok the creme brulee was too runny
overall the food was a 35 or so
wines 3 good 3 not that good 1 white wine was tasteless, i have been to many italian restaurants in shanghai so my comparison is to those in the area and the kitchen is just average the view is exceptional right on the river the outdoor dining deck is a plus the atmosphere with an open kitchen is good as well the price is high and the food is average for my money there are other italian restaurants both large and small in shanghai that deliver with better food at the same or lower prices my pasta was dry with very little lobster which was a disappointment the tuna appetizer was again average with large leaves of mint that were not really edible i tried the dessert of caramel ice cream which was just a small ball with stale biscotti cookies the service was good unless there is a client request or invitation i will probably stick with the other restaurants on my goto list

table tip avoid anything close to the door on a weekend when there is live entertainment you will never be able to hear the conversation at your table, when you need good simple well cooked real italian in shanghai this is your place great for business dinners should be even better for romantic but this ive never tried its expensive and a little too expensive for the quality but your also paying view i guess if spending opm feast away otherwise you might want to order carefully","Turkish cuisine",0.999755959630898
7,"every year when my wife and i visit shanghai we must have a meal if yangs dumplings they are golden brown crispy and soup filled that savor in your mouth weve tried many places but always return to yangs simply the best, i went to yangs dumplings following tripadvisors advice i was expecting a little shop on the street like on the picture but they relocated inside a food court its now much more modern you can expect to see a lot of people there during meal times
i tried their original dumplings pork and they are delicious and very juicy be careful not to get burned  i also tried their beef curry soup that is very good and not too spicy, my husband and i went there on a monday evening our meal consisted of 3 orders of dumplings and 2 orders of soup for less than $10 everything came piping hot and was delicious we were part of the dinner rush so the place was packed with families and people arriving with friends we were able to share a table with a young couple it was cold outside so everyone was wearing a coat no one bothered to take their coats off everyone was here for a hot delicious meal and thats it so i ate alongside them wearing my coat inside a restaurant for the first time slurping away at the deliciously hot broth and it was all good, i think this place is a chain we found this branch in a shopping precinct the foods good if you like dumplings but thats where it ends, this is a place when i am a little girl my dad would take me
i miss the old taste now that they are a chain store not so interesting
still a good deal and would recommend friends visiting shanghai to try, their dumplings is a must try in shanghai

they have shrimp vegetable and pork dumplings

we had pork dumplings and their specialty the curry vermicelli soup

their dumplings are very juicy be sure to ask for a spoon if you do not know how to eat them the proper way, i have yangs dumplings every time i come to shanghai yummy and very cheap 8 rmb the pork dumplings are my favourite but they do have shrimp and a vegetable one too, it was so delicious that i had to came back here for dinner i love the shrimp dumplings the most spoiler alert be ready to get wetdirty those dumplings are dynamite, visited the yangs on the 2nd floor right at west nanjing station we tried the yangs dumpling the tastiest imo the spinach filled one and the shrimp ones the dumplings just called yangs are by far the tastiest

we thought as there were only 4 per portion that we would not be full but we definitely found them very filling

a word of warning the broth on the inside is extremely hot i burnt my lip when taking a bite of the spinach dumpling and some broth squirted out and my lip was extremely sore for a good 15 minutes

definitely recommend trying out yangs, this place has sheng jin bao with different fillings which are juicy and delicious some of the best weve had in shanghai, im proud to have discovered yangs dumplings while exploring the city on my own
like nothing im ever had before i confess i became addicted after the first taste
their wonton soup is equally delicious as are the noodle dishes i became a regular overnight if you want a taste of local shanghai cuisine a must visit
many locations to choose from, note they have moved to the food court on level 2 i ran around a whole block trying to figure out where

in your mouth they go pop and juices come out better watch out they are hot when freshly made very cheap and yummy would recommend the combination dish, recommend anyone who loves shanghainese pan fried dumplings sheng jian bao there are a lot of yangs frydumpling franchise stores out there but this one is pure original couple of tips for genuine sheng jian bao meat must be fresh and balanced pork minced pork fatlean meatso it forms juices while cooking thin pasty and crispy hard base this really brings back the childhood memories, i cannot get over how delicious this was the pork dumplings were out of this world they are so cheap it is literally $150 for 4 of these delicious little suckers i had to go back a second time just a warning each order comes with 4 the first time i went i didnt know that so i ordered 2 pork 1 seafood and 1 veggie bun thinking i was ordering 4 dumplings much to my surprise i had actually ordered sixteen and that was only $6, took us a bit to find it but was worth the search for sure fried yet so juicy inside hot and sour soup was awesome too, tasty and cheap fried dumplings six dumpling for about $3 easy snack if you want something quick yet yummy while out and about, after having eaten shanghais homegrown panfried pork dumpling the shengjian bao a sort of cousin to famous xiao long bao i have been returning to get my weekly dose of these amazing dumplings  and most times alone

firstly i wish to thank the young boy who coincidentally happens to be working every time i visit he offered to help me order despite our apparent language barrier moreover he remembers i prefer using the non disposable chopsticks and require a soup spoon when i eat my dumplings he comes serving the utensils gleeing without me even asking now

the thick bready skin of the dumplings are sprinkled with sesame seeds and chopped spring onions they are shallowfried in wide black pans the liquid inside these dumplings are always piping hot beware

the dumplings taste impeccable so yummy my usual platter costs 18<u+00a5> for 6 dumplings 2 of each variety pork chive  lobster the pork version is absolutely succulent the lobster slightly spicy and my favorite  the chive calms the palate from the more harsh flavors of the other 2 the 3 together gives a well balanced platter

though ive been told their quality had dropped ever since the original stall expanded into a franchises i still feel they are very good

highly recommended, great dumpling and good service we asked for a hot and sour soup without the noodles just to accompany the dumplings and they gave it for free yay do try all kinds of different dumplings, i go to yangs dumplings on yuyuan lu every time i come to shanghai because it is a short walk from our office i always have the same thing pork dumplings and spicy soup with glass noodles do give them a try if you see a yangs dumplings store the entire meal will cost you about 20 rmb and you will be stuffed try the dumplings with some black vinegar and chili very yummy, my first meal in shanghai was amazing we enjoyed three types of dumplings  named shengjjian  each flavor was delish veggie pork and spicy crayfish the atmosphere was fast paced and busy we were lucky to snag a table we were the only foreigners which was a good sign the prices were very reasonable i couldnt eat all of them 6 my fave meal so far, though the quality has dropped a little as yangs expanded into a chain its fried dumplings are still consistently good across all stores if you want to find a shop near you use the spoonhuntcom app to find more location options all across shanghai

i always go for their signature fried pork dumplings and highly recommend doing the local way with a bit of vinegar, theres not much more to say other than you must try here the specialisation is xiaolongbao steamed broth dumplings and both of the cheapest are fantastic yangs own porkbeef mix and shepherds lambporkspinach dumplings are fantastic at 8 rmb for 4 do not miss these id advise buying a couple of packs and taking them to view pudong skyline at night, first came here as a student 10 years ago when this place was just a street stall and it was one of the best food i have ever had in my life now its become a chain as ubiquitous as mcdonalds standards have slipped dramatically in the process and sadly the same flavors are lost and cannot be found again, the restaurant is nothing fancy its just a place where you can enjoy the best tasting dumplings out here a bit of a difficult task choosing because the menu is in chinese and no one ever speaks english from any of their branches, we have been to yangs several times the food is tasty and prepared quite quickly there can be a line and seating can be limited so best to go at a less popular time i find it great for a late lunch as its not so crowded and still fresh and good, we last ate here in 2011 when it was still a hole in the wall  kind of eatery it is now a much bigger restaurant with more seating area and staff are all in uniforms

we ordered 2 beef with noodles soup and a plate of their fried dumplings the soup broth is now currybased and i missed the delicious rich beef broth of our previous visit the saving grace is the fried dumplings

would i come back on my next visit to shanghai no, great dumplings on the cheap side and in the traditional shanghainese way very well located next to nanjing west subway station, this place is amazingno fancy interior decoration etc but tasty and delicious fried dumplings incredibly cheap too definitely a musttry in shanghai but make sure to come early as they usually close the restaurant when they sell out their daily stock, eat these for quick bite or for lunch a year ago they extended their menu and now offer meat shrimp or vegetable fillings i prefer the meat and shrimp because they hold more soup inside

be careful when eating these delicious treats because the soup inside can burn your mouth the trick is to use a spoon underneath to stop it from falling and hold it in place with your chop sticks pierce a small hole at the top and blow until it cools then suck out the delicious soup once that messy bit is over with devour the rest enjoy, amazing dumplings thank you trip advisor of note the shop front does not match the photo you will need to go inside the eating plaza and upstairs, the dumplings here are delicious and super cheap rmb8 for 4 or you can try two of each flavour original pork crayfish or spinach for rmb16  absolute bargain the ordering process is confusing at best  just observe the regulars for  a minute and then swoop in these moreish dumplings are served piping hot as i learnt the hard way and topped with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds 

i�m not a huge fan of chains but yang�s has clearly earned its place in shanghai and expanded across the city do double check your order  after craving these again the next day we got a mixed shen jian order but were given all veggie dumplings shock horror but didn�t realise until back at the apartment aside from this point it would have received 5 stars from me no question about it, if you are in shanghai you have to try yangs fried dumplings you can get vegetarian shrimp or pork they are extremely cheap filling and especially yummy, fried dumpling or shengjian is one of the best shanghai snack one must try while there this eatery offer three flavours of fried dumplings the original pork lobster and chives for first timers i recommend getting a set of six dumplings with mixed flavours to try every flavour my favourite is the original one as it is the juiciest among all be careful while eating as the soup inside the dumpling will leak when you take the first bite one little tip ask for a chinese spoon to help you eat without getting messy, ofcourse you have to find a yangs and try xiao yang sheng jian yangs fried dumplings they perfected the art of making fried dumplings here not your average chinese dumplings and we have not yet been able to find yangs dumpling at any chinese restaurants even the authentic ones back home in the us

so good and fatty and messy and so good i guess i said good twice the juice that run out of the dumplings when you take a bite make sure they run into your container because youd want to slirp that later

after eating about 1 order of this i think 6 dumplings per order i started feeling kinda gross like i need to graze on grass for the next 3 meals so yes theyre very rich

but its one of those while youre in shanghai yangs dumplings is a must give try place unless youre a vegetarian then in that case, yangs is an institution in shanghai the store at nr1 food store on nanjing xi lu is the home of xiaolongbao and dumplings in shanghai check it out a must do when tasting shanghai food, we regularly drop in to yangs fried dumpling often and was there a couple of days ago
the place was full and is pretty much busy ll day
we bought the big fried dumplings with the juice inside yummy and very juicy absolutely authentic and an iconic shanghainesechinese food
they are a chain so look for them as it could be likely there is one near you, if you asked which food is the typical shanghai cuisine in our breakfast table i will tell you this one the fied dumplings we call it shengjian is famous and delicious its not a dumpling in my sight it is a bun maybe yangs is not the best store of shengjian but it must be the famous one in shanghai and you will love it , i went to one of the chains in a mall paris in spring but im certain that they are serving more or less same menus i tried the original ones and the seasonal shrimp ones and they were good and they are not pricey at all recommended, looking for something hot like wonton noodle but we ended up with a pasta in this place
didnt expect much about the food in the late at night but the taste was so beautiful
very good portion of the pasta for the price level very good service with friendly staff
will be back for sure, went to the one in the mall outside of metro stop did not expect anything great but they are some of the best dumplings ive ever had cheap quick easy delicious, found this gem by chance simple menu with only a handful of choices selection of dumplings and soups i tried the combo so i could taste them all 6 great dumplings all for 16 rmb, best dumplings cheap 4=8<u+00a5>
it is now situated in the food plaza 2d3d floor same road
you order at the entrance it is sufficient to point at the menu what is laying there they dont speak any english
soup is brought to you at the table you need to take the dumplings at the left from the kitchen there is a passthrough, nothing more to say on this place  you just have to go visit and eat its highly likely you need to be there early and queue for a seat its proper traditional tasty street food so just go and enjoy, yangs dumplings are a shanghai legend the taste and quality are wonderful the restaurant itself is tiny and massively overcrowded not a romantic location at all but certainly authentic if you are near the pearl tower a quick walk here is a must, shrimp dumpling is highly recommendedthe service is average and the price is reasonable hygiene is ok, after trying the soup dumpling across the road we tried yangs dumpling the next day we are lucky that we dont need to wait in long queue during lunch time as you enter to the shop you need to order and paid before shop keeper will guide you where to get your dumplings and guide your seat we ordered a plate of fried pork dumplings vegetables fried dumplings a pork bones with glass noodles soup both fried dumplings wasnt excellent because they fried it in a huge pan by the time they sold that pan of dumplings there wasnt many customers the fried dumplings become cold when the dumplings are cold its become very greasy the soup was good match with the dumplings and its yummy, this place seems to simple and humble but after you try their dumplings you will be absolutely blown away they were the best dumplings we had in shanghai and honestly the best dumplings weve ever had once we discovered it we kept going back every day the pork dumplings were definitely my favorite but the shrimp ones were delicious too you get a few in a set and 1 order per person is sufficient for lunch i wish i could give this place 6 stars, staying at the marriott city centre hotel exploring the surrounding with my family and stumble across this restaurant with a small crowd of people waiting for their food went to check it out and found that the people were waiting for their fried dumpling orders we quickly place our orders and within the next 5 mins a huge crowd of people were waiting for their dumpling orders we got our orders within 10 mins and headed back to our hotel i only found out that this restaurant is ranked top 10 in trip advisor today when i was browsing for other good restaurants in shanghai

once back in our room hotel is just a few mins walk from this restaurant we quickly open our packed dumplings to eat them while its still hot i took my first biteand i couldnt wait for the second bite juices from the fried dumpling was oozing out and its just simply delicious we bought the pork dumpling and the vegetable dumpling some of us like the pork version better while some like the vege versionboth are equally delicious

today is my 4th day in shanghai and we have had these dumplings 3 times already its worth hunting down this placeenjoy, we had a few different items at this dumpling shop basically imagine a meatball wrapped with a thin oily layer of dough and deepfried thats the signature product of this place they are positively scrumptious

the wonton soup really was interesting because the wontons are garnished with a healthy dose of cilantro  it is such a refreshing twist to wonton soup wonderful, yes a line up but worth the wait enjoyed the dumplings outside very tasty with a yummy crusty bottom and delicious broth","Taiwanese cuisine",0.929910132613659
70,"you absolutely must see the night lights over the bund from their rooftop bar nothing like it anywhere else otherwise you pay a lot extra for the view, we came for the phenomenal night view and were disappointed to learn it was western but we decided it might be interesting to see what chinese chefs could do we found this very high quality gourmet we experienced highly professional service that you rarely encounter outside new york and paris it was expensive but worth the splurge the sky bar looked great but it was raining, i dined here as part of a large business group the views are stunning particularly at night as one can see the building lights of the pudong side the food is quite good as well we had a set menu which was a little much but the main surf and turf was delectable, had a great diner here with a large group the fine dining menu had a good selection of options and the lamb was juicy and delicious service was attentive and overall atmosphere good views of the city and river were absolutely spectacular, with a view in the bund in both directions this is a spectacular place to have dinner on the 8th floor one floor up is the sky bar  which also has a large outside terras the black cod was excellent and the selection of bread great i lived the cheesecake dessert, we dined on the 27th floor and found the food and view to be spectacular the aged steaks and seafood are truly world class the wine list is pricey but with a view of the shanghai skyline at night who cares reservations are needed since it is a small and popular dining room the outside terrace is a great photo spot as the sun goes down, the bar at the top of the building has a fullon view of the pudong side of the river with its unique skyline i expected the drinks to be outrageously expensive but they werent lots of good draft beer too, took lunch here lovely view of pearl tower food was awesom and best quality well cooked servers are all nice worth of money, enjoyed a tremendous view of the bund from the top floor really nice bar on top floor and restaurant as well excellent steaks and sides if a bit expensive unbelievable wine list with a heavy focus on french varietals additionally a couple of floors below is the wine cellar which is supposed to be the largest in china easy to believe after taking a tour of the private cellars in addition to the general cellar you may also eat in the cellar but personally i preferred the upstairs location if you are looking for a bit of the western world while in china this is a spot to try for sure certainly no more expensive that venturing to pudong for mortons and a lot more character and view to be enjoyed highly recommend, wow what a great historic building we walked around the building and went to the rooftop for a glass of wine you can sit inside or out but if possible go when you can sit outside you have a wonderful view of the bund, and the reason is precious few of the locals seem to have heard of it we asked our concierge for a recommendation for a good rooftop bar and he mentioned the roosevelt but he could only give us the broadest of directions� its on the bund somewhere well we found it come down nanjing street til you hit the waterfront turn left follow the numbers its the dark building and its a glorious little place with an indoor barrestaurant on the top inddor floor and an open air rooftop bar on the next floor up prices are fine cocktails are well made and great value and the view� this evening was the highlight of our trip� forget the terracotta warriors and the great wall� here you can get nicely drunk and look out over the night skyscraper skyline reflected in colour on the yangtsee magical, was here with group of 30+ so cant speak to general service nor menu selection as we had fixed menu but the filet was good and cooked nicely wine selection is huge service for our group was good view from the top floor outside was amazing, the food was of a high standard the service was attentive the wine list is one of the most extensive i have seen

warning the restaurant is expensive but worth it, went there to celebrate a birthday and had a good time location is great with amazing bund view service is really good and the waiters were polite and professional the wine list is amazing
as for the food we went for alacart beef carpaccio and tomato salad were a good start to an excellent steak filet and a very good black code fish
deserts chocolate lava with icecream and cream brulee were just ok compare to the other dishes
bottom line expensive good food good service good view, met with friends great view from the bar terrace great cocktails try the bund breeze some good bar snacks quite expensive but your in prime location
staff friendly, very pleasant night in october at a very nice restaurant on the bund food is very good but pricey wine list is amazing, incredible food service atmosphere unreal i got the minestrone soup for lunch and it was divine if youre going for dinner you need a reservation at least one week before, let alone the excellent views of the harbor the bund and pudong the top of the roosevelt hotel provides indoor air conditioned space and two great outdoor spaces no outdoor shelter from the rain though as a couple we were not expected to both order tea my husband preferred to order off the regular menu for me the tea was tasty although i wish there had been more savory than sweet offerings the jasmine tea was subtle and well perfumed, my favourite restaurant in shanghai offering fantastic steacks of high quality just delicious given the top quality of the goods offered prices are reasonable in addition you enjoy the really breathtaking view on the shanghai skyline service is high professionell skilled and very well english speaking staff takes care of you and all guests i recommend enjoy, as we were traveling during the offseason we were able to get a great table with an amazing view without a reservation the service was great and provided a lot of information about the menu items the food was amazing this is fine dining at its best great food elegant setting an amazing view from the bund overlooking the futuristic skyline one of the best meals of our lives come prepared to spend $, nice location and atmosphere for wine tastings depending on the weather either in the rooftop bar or indoors 200 rmb for a tasting of 56 wines including canapees unfortunately it seems nowadays that the house of roosevelt is promoting their slow movers which means that the quality of the wines is sometimes not very high standard, well a cocktail is going for 99rbm here in the sky bar 20cdn with the exchange

i have to admit that the view is spectacular giving its clients a lovely show of the bund down below but is it any different from another roof top doubt it

free internet a little added bonus nice way to chill after a day of walking and sight seeing is it a must do no idea i guess it depends on budget and your set of mind

lovely weather midseptember making it a very pleasant breezy evening thing to do, they took our order on a sunny weekday afternoon with few other people in place around 130 as we had to wait until 2 to go up the roof terrace half the orders arrived half didnt when i asked for the manager and explained the issue he in what i could only describe as a cowardly fashion picked the youngest most innocent waiter he could and blamed him for it all being wrong for not speaking english the fact of the matter was as i described to the manager wed been served by a senior female member of staff who had actually not told us that the meals on the lunch menu were not available until dinner time  which made no sense and she spoke perfect english so no lunch for half of us in essence its just a local chinese bar selling below par yet expensive western food in a good location but with a western name on the door go there for the view across the river and leave to eat elsewhere is probably your best bet as there are some much better places right around the corner, famous on the bund and rightly so nice ambience and good but very pricey food steaks  drink what really makes it is the view on the bundpudong at and just after sunset when the lights come on well known to chinese as a good proposal place popping the question there shows you have taste and wealth unfortunately the upper roof terrace was closed due to a private party, im leaving in sh for more than 10 years and that than place i bring all my friends  or family i use to go there once a month is fantastic sky bar not to crowed at 8 pm food  drinks staff are not so good but never mind you get the view which is for me the best of sh for a drink before diner, the roosevelt sky bar was very lively with lots of people  great music it was a bit hard to have a conversation as the music was a tad bit loud but you just soak up the atmosphere  enjoy the view of the bund which is very beautiful at night when all the lights are on the drinks are on the expensive side but then you are paying for the view  the staff are very nice worth trying at least once or more, go straight to the top of the roof and sit outside after dinner and have a few drinks and enjoy the lights of pudong area of shanghai pearl tower in all its glory, incredible views of the skyline from the top floor nice rocking music rather old but still fun and a nice mix too loud for conversation but lower floors have more quiet areas if desired, we made reservations to have a table with a view of the river and the financial district
our reservation was delayed over half an hour but the view and the food made up for it
the food and service were very good, from wine cellar to champagnes from chinese to american food with 9 stunning floors and over 62 chefs house of roosevelt offers the best in class and taste above all over the last few visits the staff makes you feel at home and takes exceptional care of guests, one of the most famous restaurants in shanghai well known for its rooftop bar with stunning views the restaurant is great but the food not so foie gras in a plastic cup surf and turf was not very impressive, stunning views especially if the weather cooperates but there are other places on the bund with stunning views and much better value usd$50 for 3 beers is a bit overthetop and unnecessary food is hitandmiss most times and at the prices they charge no excuse for that, went there with a few business colleagues for a business dinner was very impressed with the food choices and service level of the staffs a bit pricy but a good place to impress your business partner or wifegirl friend excellent view of the shanghai city from the terrace too, had dinner with our colleagues 100 plus awesome terrace view of shanghai city and river being a sunday had the opportunity to see huge chinese crowd moving on the banks of the river food is the best one i had in china, after a long day of visit get to their roof top can be windy and enjoy the view  the service has always been super bad but i have to say it is getting better since a year once you have your drink always very good relax and enjoy the sunset over the bund and pudong tower there is no better option if you want to be outside behind this scenery , if youre looking to have a really nice candlelit dinner with someone this is definitely the place to go to youll be able to have an amazing view of the financial district while youre eating food that can easily compete with most other restaurants in this price range

with that said this isnt a cheap place and the portions arent large if youre civilized and know how to enjoy your food you will leave delighted if you feel that it is more important that you get to eat until youre completely full you should be prepared to order in a extra starter or two, incredible view from one of their glass rooms and the openair bar upstairs is a great place to relax before or after dinner food was ok but nothing special 3 out of 4 of us had beef that was cooked properly but underseasoned and served luke warm the duck confit was very good very attentive servers but that doesnt equal good service waited 20 minutes and had to ask 3 times for my daughters drink they brought the wrong sauce for my wifes ribeye and it took 15 minutes to get the right one lots of servers around to refill our glasses but need to work on the basics of serving the right food hot i expect a lot more at this price, with one of the best views of the iconic pudong skyline to excellent service and a wide choice of gourmet offerings the sky restaurant at house of roosevelt is a must visit choice for even the most discerning foodie
simply stunning, the food is so good here but you pay for it remarkable views over the bund a place that you would go for special occasions the night lights over the bund makes a spectacular view massive wine list that impressed us and the only sad part is the bill at the end
great beers on tap also
excellent steak but over the top in price
save it for a special occasion, sky bar restaurant atop the house of roosevelt has one of the most spectacular views in the city excellent place for private event teddys bar and cigar room on lower level, we had lunch at the sky restaurant and it was delicious i had a fish dish that was excellent lunch was served quickly also we had a nice view of the huangpu river and pudong skyline, when im in shanghai i always go there fantastic view good service and food ask for a blood mary and enjoy it at the rooftop, great old building beautiful decor formal style excellent service the views and the surroundings are what you pay for it isnt cheap set menus on the specials list run between about <u+00a3>70 <u+00a3>150 we went cheaper with a la carte soup meat dish and dessert

the food is good if unexceptional it wasnt the best quality ribeye steak ive ever had but at <u+00a3>60 or so it was certainly one of the most expensive it was perfectly cooked as requested however

we noted that wolf blass yellow label is offered at around <u+00a3>55 a bottle  the cheaper end of a long wine list and  of course this wine retails around just <u+00a3>6<u+00a3>7 a bottle at home as i said you are paying for the location and surroundings best put costs out of your mind and just enjoy it, an absolute must visit for travelers and locals alike amazing wine cellar complements some of the best food in china not just shanghai owner tim tse is the consummate host ensuring his staffs attentive world class service and his chefs culinary achievements the food is creative and extraordinarily flavorful and features lots of locally sourced organic ingredients the setting in a historic building on the bund is world class as well and has the best views of the lights on the bund the river and the colorful oriental pearl tower plentiful outdoor areas allow guests to take in the amazing vistas in relaxing style i look forward to returning every time i come to shanghai, gorgeous views from this rooftop bar they have several beautiful unique drinks i had the chocolate raspberry  delicious another in our party had the espresso martini

we also had their hamburger sliders they were fresh and hot but a bit on the bland side for my american tastebuds, a very nice place to spend an evening in shanghai the view from the top is wonderful you can see the river  the tv tower across the river
good place to enjoy your drink on the roof top i visited in november the weather was very pleasant, we have been with friends in the rooftop bar and i have to admit that the view to the bund and the skyline of shanghai is amazing in summer it must be even better to have a cocktail under the open sky i consider the prices for the cocktails as rather moderate, ask for a table with a view
food is interesting combination of asian and western dishes menu is extensive and has something nice for everyone, wow its a good thing i didnt read the reviews before we visited lol

after 2 weeks in shanghai my boyfriend and i spent our last night walking on the bund the streets were empty as it was raining which was a relief not to have to dodge the daily procession of brides and grooms getting their photographs taken or getting smacked in the face by the numerous selfie sticks flying about

we decided to check out the bars in the area and as i did not enjoy bar rouge and its pretentious crowd nor the super pricey vue bar we passed by the roosevelt hotel and noticed that their bar was still open

took the elevators up to the sky bar and what a treat it was no crowd probably because of the bad reviews below and lovely views of the pudong skyline it was very spacious and we got service right away i wished we had known about this place before it wouldve have been our go to place, i ate here on a saturday night with two coworkers the food was very good a ribeye australian steak the wine list was quite daunting with page after page of various wines from everywhere around the world thankfully there was a wine expert who was able to choose a great bottle for us lastly the view was amazing overlooking the bund and seeing the shanghai skyline from our table

i will mention that the restaurant is dressy with most men wearing suits and women wearing dresses","dumpling restaurant",0.827445023086141
71,"a very good place to find italian food in shanghai if you get tired on local food its kind of a little italy with atmospere which you will find in a normal pizza all around the world its a chinese crew with an italian did not ask but asume based on the dialect chef they are doing a good work the pizza was tasty to a good price of 100rnb, we have been there several times we like the ambiance we feel like if we were in italia its a convivial place with a terrace the food is pretty good and the wine affordable the boss is an itilian guy and have 3 restaurants in shanghai biz should be good 
try it you will not be disappointed, i personally think that this restaurant is a bit overrated and it is still working with the fame it had in the past years when i started living in shanghai 6 years ago this was my favourite place the atmosphere is cozy the staff is nice and you feel to be in an italian trattoria this has never changed and it feels good but in the last two years ive been there different times and i have been fairly disappointed last time i got a not very cheap bill and for the quality and the quantity of the food i am not comfortable to pay the cold cuts are definitely not the best in town especially prosciutto crudo or mortadella which is average if you compare it to others place in the city the fried calamari are a bit whitey and oily and i got a seafood pasta which was extremely peppered which the result of covering the seafood overall flavour seafood where fresh though nice dessert but still feeling like there is no research of fine quality or the desire of astonishing and pleasing the customers appetite but this is also probably a choice of the restaurant marketing the one of standing on a average range of price and quality, famous backyard italian for all foreigners and lots of germans  reasonable priced and nice events like pizza baking classes for kids on lunchtime weekends

while food is general ok  like the ravioli most and the soups  the pizzas are too often underbaked and made in a rush  but they take it back without any complain and improve, a restaurant hidden in a narrow street but i had a guide to show me
really good pizzas but this evening success was the pasta just loved it
a good place, the best is to start with focaccia arrives in 3 waiting to order the choice of pasta and pizza is always wide and good and the main courses of fish are tasty
desserts are tipically italians little bit heavy the sicilian or napoletan  preferred the apple cake with ice cream, the restaurant is tucked in the dark alley once you opened the door you will be surprised with its interior size quite big the place was filled with about 70 foreigners and 30 natives it seems coming back from italy about 7 months ago forgive me for comparing the establishment with those restaurants in italy the food served is not bad everything from calamari to egg plant to pastas were fine but not excellent enough to urge you to come back again the best thing we had was pizzas and the wine they are very good if you are craving for good pizzas and drinks and yearning for a de tour from the shanghainese food go for it, great pastas and fresh seafood in a casual setting they have a 2nd floor that is more geared towards larger groups but it always have a very warm and friendly vibe prices are reasonable very reasonable, the restaurant is a bit hidden on a path at changle road so heads up for the sign the restaurant is bigger than expected and on friday evening it was crowded and loud despite of that the pizza was very tasty

seems also like a foreigners favorite place if you want to avoid that you might look for another restaurant, this place was a great find the food is amazing and inexpensive and the pizzas are exactly the same as you would find in the best places in italy the desserts are to die for we had a house special cake dessert which was delicious unlike another reviewer we found the service to be excellent the waiters were attentive and friendly the service was swift we even had the owner drop by to say hello if you are after tasty authentic italian food at a reasonable price in shanghai i dont think you could do better, i had dinner with friends for the first time in this restaurant food was absolutely great and price reasonable i totally recommend it we tried different appetizers first dishes pizza desserts everything was over the expectations the best in shanghai, i visited bela napoli with a friend for drinks and hoped to enjoy a meal afterwards we chose an outside table which proved to be a big mistake no staff came to check whether we wanted more drinks or food after 20 mins of waiting we stood up to go inside to get service the manager made excuses that the night was busy however we observed the waitresses inside having continuous casual conversation i would not recommend this restaurant based on attitudes of staff as well as the manager, i discovered this place during one of my midday rambles taking some air away from meetings it turned out to be a great find
we booked a table for the evening and i took my chinese colleagues with me to hopefully show them what italian food can be like none of us was disappointed from the beer the decor and the atmosphere we arrived early evening and the place quickly filled up with friday night diners from groups like ours visiting italians who seemed to enjoy it too families and small partys
so the usual mix and the food was great i had sea bass for my main and the vegetables and the salads were good and the fresh bread mmm
the guys were surprised by the experienced and they asked me how i know so many places and i told them just to follow their noses its easy, been there with 10 friends food and service were on point its like diving into italy for certain time the price is high but the food is totally worth it i wish i could eat there every day keep up the good work, pretty straightforward italian nothing is fancy but everything is in good shape from food to service i liked the outdoor seating area no wonder why they are on business in shanghai for so long, this is a great restaurant they can get overlooked the style is causal which in this town is a real pleasure the food is always good not great and something you right home about but great value for money and i say with all honestly

my only complaint albeit a minor one is their takeaway food which i personally picked up was poorly executed the lasagna was cold in the center and the spaghetti pesto was far too undercooked and i live 3 minutes away so this was not a matter of getting cold the spaghetti was not aldente this was under cooked would that stop me from going again not at all

i still rate a 4 out of 5, this is the best italian restaurant in shanghai no doubts on that
for a moment it gives you the feeling you are definitely in italy the food taste like in italy they serve very good wine along with the food must have is definitely the risotto and the tuna steak, the venue had a constant stream of diners flowing through the doors but we were given drinks food order taken then ignored no bread basket no follow up on drinks and we had to ask two different servers for our food when it did arrive i was given the wrong dish and then the pasta was not al dente rather it was under cooked and very disappointing not a lunch to remember, this is a place that local and expats equally prefer which is always a good sign we were seated on outside patio and the vibe was nice there was one italian guy and a lady around in the service area the chef seems to be an italian as well wine corkage fee was 150 rmb as i remember which is a steal  though they have pretty good wine deals

we had pizza pasta and fillet  all were prepared nicely  with fresh ingrdients

the service was ok and mostly done by chinese staff good place for a casual lunch or dinner, great food and ambiance good for a date friends and family outings they have limited beer selection but great food and wine the patio is a great added touch at this locations the food is outstanding, historical italian restaurant in shanghai one of the very first excellent wood fire oven pizza pasta fish and many other italian dishes good service and nice environment, really great food rustic gnocchetti and phenomenal pizza make sure to get the bufala mozzarella service decent for shanghai will be back for the food quality alone, good food original italian imported ingredients very good service and right price dont miss it dessert selection is also very good, i have to thank this restaurant and pizzeria because in the long staying in shanghai has helped me to remember a nice piece of our italian taste and not onlythe decoration remember an old italian trattoriathe service is very goodthe prices are fair comparing with the average of shanghai and the quality of foodstrongly recommend, have been to bella napoli numerous times 5+ the past few years and have definitely seen the level of food service and food quality drop measurably but tonight was the last straw in terms of bad food and endless excuses from a staff that doesnt seem to understand that there is a lot of competition that can beat them at italian in shanghai it definitely proved to be the wrong decision to go there for a prevalentines dinner tonight
while not totally surprising the waitress was far from engaging and seemed to be primarily interested in how quickly she could turn the table the meal started off ok with a good round of appetizers bresaola for my wife  daughter and lentil soup for me the main courses arrived shortly thereafter and the gnocchi for my daughter was good my sea bass was tasty but definitely cold by the time it reached the table my wifes ravioli was so under cooked it was inedible we alerted our waitress to the problem and she promptly took the ravioli from the table and back to the kitchen
after 20 minutes both my daughter and i had already finished our meals and my wifes ravioli had still not been returned to the table as our waitress had seemed to have totally lost interest in us not returning to refill water glasses pour more wine ask us if everything was ok let alone bring back my wifes dinner i called over the maitre di to explain our problem he returned after 5 minutes with my wifes dish of fresh ravioli or so we thought what we found was the exact same dish of food that had left our table 20 minutes earlier and certainly was no better than it was what it left the table the first time my wife politely tried to eat what she could but this resulted in her trimming the edged off each piece of uncooked ravioli when i complained to the maitre di again he had the nerve to suggest that we should have elevated the problem to him earlier rather than communicating the problem to our waitress as that was how things worked in china when i informed him that i had lived in china for 3 years and in asia for 10 years and that it should not be my responsibility to ensure his staff was properly trained he then suggested that the problem was probably related to chef not having prepared the pasta thickness according to their new practice when we asked why a fresh dish had not been prepared versus just trying to further heat the pasta that had been previously prepared he said that was their normal practice his excuses got to the point where i respectfully asked him to leave the table before i got overly angry to cause a scene in front of the balance of the restaurant all the while our original waitress never came back to our table to provide any level of serviceapologyetc
while the ravioli was taken off of our bill i would view the experience at bella napoli to have been a total disaster and would not recommend it as a preferred italian restaurant in shanghai prices are generally good but the inconsistent service and food quality have dropped this place off my list of preferred locales in shanghaii can find far better restaurants to spend 1000 rmb at, look for the light up sign to find the alley you turn down for this place  super helpful and makes it easy to find quaint clean and authentic design we called for reservations and we were glad we did  by the time we left the place was packed so its probably a good idea to reserve a table
the food was fantastic we tried a pizza nice crust great toppings and cooked perfectly we also tried a calzone and while it could have used a tad more flavor maybe olives or something it was filled with goodness was cooked perfectly and was very satisfying the sauce inside was not a sweet sauce more of a true tomato sauce the pasta dish was excellent we tried the four cheese pasta with penne and the blend of the cheeses make this exquisite sauce  you can tell its fresh and the chef knows what theyre doing highly recommend that dish will definitely get it again for dessert we tried a cannoli and while it was good it had other flavors that seemed a little unusual im not italian though but we still ate all of it so it was pretty good i think next time id rather try the nutella pizza i heard about
the service was okay we were greeted and seated in a friendly way but when i had a question about the menu the waitress went to check but wasnt thrilled the tortellini is already made with the ham inside so you cant get it without ham  although i really wish they had a cheese only tortellini or ravioli  not a pumpkin fan either so the ravioli was a no go for me too needless to say since i couldnt order that she was less happy when i had a second question it was our first time there in all fairness and having worked in the restaurant industry for years i feel they were both questions she probably should have easily known the answers to when we were ready to order about ten minutes after being seated it felt a tad like we were bothering her and she didnt really want to come over for fear wed have another question but she did and she clarified no tomato sauce on our pasta so we hoped our food would come out correctly and it did honestly the service is the only reason its four and not five stars again to be fair it was a busy friday night but still it was difficult to get someones attention during the meal to get things like more water and the check
the italians that run the place were very hospitable though and made us feel right at home we noticed several actual italians coming in to dine so you can tell they havent lost touch with their roots and their food still brings in the true experts and they are gobbling it up too
there are nice small touches too  from what we heard over 80 of the ingredients are imported and its nice having a lovely balsamic vinegar and quality oil to dip your bread in the bread that they bring out is very tasty cooked in the brick oven which i heard is made of imported bricks from the owners hometown and is delicious although you only get one round of bread when i wanted some more to soak up the pasta cheese sauce i was brought a basic bread
overall its a great place it does get busy and little loud but well worth it prices are reasonable not cheap but well worth it and the food is excellent the food is the main thing we focus on when we dine out so well easily overlook some flaws in service for great food great place for dates or dinner with friends
two side notes  bathrooms were clean so thats always a good sign and i think they have high chairs too, i got to eat here with friends in shanghai and it was so good to find great italian here in the city the restaurant is very authentically italian with wonderful tortellini and lasagna and great service its a cozy place and a little difficult to find but well worth the effort, what a nice restaurant the restaurant is in a small lane in the former french concession it looks very small but there is a second floor with more tables the decoration of the restaurant is simple but nice the food is very good we were with a group of 12 people we all got served about the same time , kitchen no frills no fancy decoration or presentation of the dish no bullshit
just high quality ingredients very well cooked in the traditional delicious way
the restaurant is as well very simple and traditional style with a nice outdoor area
the result is a warm feeling of home and a great satisfaction of the palate
service ok prices overall reasonable
looking forward to come back again soon, i like to try local food when i travel  and i must say that i like chinese food  but for a night i had the chance to came back to italy with bella napoli pizza thats a good pizza, with all the towering sky scrapers in shanghai and pudong it is a wonder that there are still little narrow lanes and small old buildings along the treelined streets of the french concession in shanghai bella napoli is a garden resto in such an idyllic setting no fast food chain or dishing out of canned ingredients bella napoli features freshest food items cooked according to old authentic napoli recipes their grilled vegetables egg plant pepper corns tomatoes and pine cones are a real treat as are the bruschetas pizzas are hand crafted by luca spaghettis are always al dente crispy tender pasta desserts are all home made and often served with gelato

several young chinese boys and girls do the serving and all speak english sometimes a little italian a little french oh they also speak chinese very euroambianced though yuan priced and reasonably so

want to get away from it all forget the stress and headaches beat the city noise

have a meal at bella napoli
bon apetito, probably i am not a typical italian that misses the home food too much otherwise i couldnt have had surviving in china for almost eleven years but yes sometimes i need pizza and i want the real one
bella napoli does make the real pizza from napoli
when possible i go there once a week with my wife for a treat a simple italian treat pizza a glass of wine and an espresso coffee
when the quality is good you just need to enjoy no need for more, we used to go there often with my wife but since a few times my feeling is that the global quality of food and service is decreasing they have a very nice terrase in a lane which is worth it food is average for an italian restaurant, every time i go to this location or the newer one the standards are the same fantastic ingredients

check out this season imported fungi with pappardelle and on pizza always have their classic carpaccio of veal with tuna sauce

its a shanghai standard, this restaurant has no fantastic decor and renovation but have good italian food out of italy but yet not so expensive about rmb140200person
this restaurant is situated inside a small alley, i visited with my friends quite often during 2012 to 2013 when i worked in shanghai very friendly service and absolutely yum italian food made me not hesitate even for a second whenever my colleagues visited in shanghai and asked for dining recommendations but i was really disappointed when i came back to visit my friends in shanghai a couple of weeks agobeautiful italian food as usual but extremely bad service this time the waiter was complaining that we didnt order entrees given the fact that three of us arrived in the restaurant around 830 right after we have wine cheese platter and seafood basket in a wine lounge and we ordered three pastas three desserts and a bottle of wine that was just rude to say that in front of us even though he said that in chinese unfortunately i can fully understand mandarin due to my chinese background, bella napoli serves excellent pizza just like napoli style pizza should be thin crusted pizza baked in a decent oven a little disappointing was the cappers salad with fake mozzarella the service is perfect and the laves coffee fabulous, the sausage gnocchi was awesome finding good sausage in shanghai can be challenging and this was excellent i was weary of this place due to having been to the other location the service here however was quite friendly though we did order a pizza and that message didnt quite make it to the kitchen luckily everything we ordered was good tomatoes for the caprese could have been better cheese was good though more basil enjoy a nice dinner here not five star but nice nonetheless, we have been living in shanghai for 5 years bella napoli for us has been our favorite italian restaurant a very nice place with impeccable service where children have their place and their activities making pizzas the owners of the place are two amazing people guido and laimei we miss you if youre italian you will feel like at home, bella napoli is one of our favorite italian restaurants in shanghai and hits the sweet spot of quality food with fresh ingredients without being overly expensive the tomato sauce used on the pizza is clearly homemade which makes all the difference in the world also the restaurant setting down a small alleyway within an old house makes for a unique experience during the summer there is an outdoor treeshaded patio in the winter this space is covered and heated some notes

1 this is a familyfriendly restaurant and also good for groups but be sure to book ahead as it is popular

2 there is an openkitchen area with bricklined fireplace to make pizzas on saturdays kids are invited during lunch to make their own pizza for free with paying adult do call ahead to reserve and check that the promotion is still offered

3 bella napoli also offers a great lunch set the most basic is 68 rmb including a starter pasta and drink other more expensive combinations are available

4 its a little hard to find but well worth it from the corner of changle road and middle wulumuqi road walk east along the north side of changle road walk about 60 meters and there will be an alley on the left with a small black sign marking bella napoli walk north another 60 meters or so and bella napoli will be on your right, this is our favorite pizza restaurant neoapolitan style in shanghai they have two locations both nice staff are nice and fast but the place get busy so a reservation is recommended the best dessert is the pizza nutella we splitted among the family because would have been to much for one after having already eaten a pizza but i guess depends on the family in any case it was fantastic saturday at lunch if you have kids they can make their own pizza our kids love it, our favorite italian restaurant in town great atmosphere delicious food cool staff in winters their garden will be closed by glass window so you still have outdoor seats but wont feel cold we had our wedding dinner with our friends, we live in shanghai and time to time we like a pizza this is one of the places to go
the pizza is good quite thick as it should be in naples and in fact the owner is from naples the location is very nice in the former french concession and the ambiance is likable especially because of the garden which you wont enjoy unless you are a smoker or you want to smoke for free thanks to the many chinese smokers around you and to the very limited air circulation  speaking about food we like the pizza del console dedicated to the former italian general consul but we tried other dishes as well not bad although very simple wine list is limited and not all labels are available negative notes the young lady is the only pleasant person in the restaurant the rest of the personnel is not very nice and not very efficient by the way although they have a garden they dont like dogs, lost in a discrete lane house this quiet and very good restaurant is a nice place to enjoy a good dinner outside napoli style pizzas are excellent , woudl always come again  my fav italian in shanghai after doc so far the service is attentive the atmosphere great a small cosy place with good italian spitit and good service, after two weeks in china we couldnt face another noodle or dumpling and so i searched for pizza in shanghai french concession we went to bella napoli and the italian food was amazing from a pizza margherita thin crust to a cheese plate with amazing gorgonzola to pasta with sausage everything was delicious and the service was excellent the owner came by to speak with us who was belgianchinese married to an italian and she was very friendly lots of expats there when you want an alternative to chinese food  which is good but after a while gets old this is the place in shanghai, bella napoli is my favourite western restaurant in shanghai italian food is scarce where i live in china so i love going here when in shanghai i definitely prefer the changle rd location as the alleyway entrance and little courtyard are so charming if it is your first time visiting you should be careful to look out for the black bella napoli sign at the entrance to the alleyway normally when i come here my friend and i split a pizza and pasta dish as both are so good we like either the margherita pizza or the cheese pizza with the tomato gnocchi  it is delicious there seems to be mix of diners more chinese early in the evening followed by foreigners who flood in later in the evening i would definitely recommend booking no matter what time you go but later in the evening i think you are more likely to be offered a complimentary glass of limoncello, there are few reasons you should visit bella napoli one is the location and design and a second one is the food
this restaurant is located in the middle of french concession in an old shanghai house in a hidden lane which gives it a special charm great outdoor area becomes indoor in winter and a nice open area under the trees in summer

i had a chance to try many dishes as ive been there several times main dishes steak and fish are very delicious pizza and pasta are fantastic and dont forget to try a dessert =

i think the price is quite reasonable for a good quality food most expensive steak is rmb 190 fish is rmb 95 pastapizza  around rmb 90, ive been going since 2008 at old location
and never disapointed the food quality has been pretty constant for years there is always an italian manager maybe owner to supervise operations the food is perfect
 i am italian and the service works well it is priced right in the middle not expensive the ambience is warm italian country style
yes i keep going there for my pizza nights all friends i brrought there were pretty happy never a bad comment
good selection of wines, loved the outdoor seating space feels like ive been transported out of shanghai back into europe usually filled with loads of expats living in shanghai this restaurant has made a name for itself in the local expat community value for money for the quality of service as well as food served ive been to this restaurant over 10 times in the past half a year
a must go should you feel you miss a good pizza done properly","bar",0.724977767815097
72,"very nice set up with a bund view prices are very reasonable for the location and ambiance and although the price of a pizza may seem expensive it is well worth it for the complete package food and service was very good, ate here yesterday for dinner and it is a nicely laid out restaurant and the food was served in good portions and the service was sharp i reall enjoyed the tuna steak however the beer was not cold a good choice in shanghai for an italian but nothing extraordinary, we liked atto primo they proved us that one can have a very good italian food in shanghai with reasonable prices liked their wine selections too many by the glass and half bottle options even tutti fungi was the name of the full mushroom pizza we ordered but we did not like that much though it looks very shiny and delicious may be chef should consider to add some more veggies to that pizza beef strip loin was nice with classical baked garlic and salt presentation overall satisfying experience service was fine, starting with shared appetizers speedup the warmup and there various choices from different regions both gnocchi and rice typical milanese are well cooked and served too much to test the dessert , very good tasty food at 2nd floor the bund 5with beautiful views of the bundyou will definitely not disappointed, i was so eager to visit atto primo after hearing so many recommends from mu friends a quick glance
1 location perfect  all touristic places and clubs are all in walking distance inculding bund bar rouge and unico

2 the restaurant located in a very nice building even the toilets are like a living room

3 dining area is nice with a open kitchen and wood fired pizza oven consept

4 table set up could be better the american style plastic like easy type table clothes are not fit for the restaurant

5 servers are partly chinese partly philipines  our server was michelle and cashier was monling both were nice

6 food was good without wow factor but also without any problem but suggest them cancel the fried seafood from menu it was the worst point of our dinner fried with heavy taste oil and everything tasted the same

7 total damage was around 200 usd with 2 glass white and half bottle red, very pleased with our experience and meal  we visited on a wednesday  place closes at 1030 pm so we rocked up around 930 pm without reservations and at that time only few people were left dining so we were lucky to get a window seat to enjoy the pudong view we both had pizza  no complaints service and meal was great  staff is very attentive and enjoyed the ambience  rest is located in the same building that houses ruth chris steakhouse  m in the bund  walking distance from our hotel if you are looking for italian  with a view  highly recommend , what a great place we were there for new years pizza was good and the risotto also drinks were amazing nice view the only thing i disliked was the vocalist she just could not sing  but she tried lol
highly recommend this place to anyone thanks for the great experience, perfect christmas dinner of course this is the best italian restaurant i found in shanghai

this time i decided to go for appetizer and pizza and ive been satisfied for both of them

this restaurant also gets a very nice view on the bund and good atmosphere

massimiliano, the bund is full of decent restaurants but if you are looking for a great italian restaurant there atto primo should be your choice i love going there with a bunch of friends and ordering the chinese way many different dishes putting everything into the middle just to be able to dive into all the different dishes why ordering only one starter and one main if you can enjoy all the great flavours atto primo serves on top their wine menu offers a great selection of wines from all over the world so wine lovers have a great choice here too definitely worth a try i am looking forward to the next visit, never been a fun of italian restaurants abroad but this time i have to make an exception
being vegan it�s not easy to find places willing to change their menu and help you out with the food you can eat but in atto primo they surprised me a lot i�ve been there with a group of friends and right after we told the waitress that i was vegan the chef it self came out of the kitchen to let me know that there was not problem at all to prepare a vegan meal for me that�s what costumers service it�s about and believe me the vegetable pasta he prepared was absolutely delicious� nothing to envy to a normal dish  good job atto primo great location great service and above all great food, excellent italian restaurant on the bund with great view on the pudong skyline i went there for their trippa advisor night the atmosphere was great the real italian food excellent and the wines a great match chef gianluca is very attentive and friendly even before tasting it is a pleasure to watch the kitchen staff at work

a big thanks to our lovely waitress tess and monling for taking such a good care of us and to chef gianluca for his high recommendation on food and wine pairing

will see you definitely soon, super food  had gone with office people and the place was just the right mix of fun and proper  food was great though we only went in for the vegetarian options  service was good too and their chief hostess  manager stood out for me as the finest in shanghai  will go back here for more reasons than one   the wine list was great too  will surely recommend further, i had a really nice experience dining at atto primo the location is great and the whole restaurant offers a great view on the bund and shanghais skyline try to get at table directly at the windows so you can experience it to the full the food is classical italian and so is the great selection of wines i really loved the beef tartare and the truffle pizza the service was good very attentive i will definitely come back soon again, this place is truly something else put aside the top class view amazing service and fantastic atmosphere the food itself is special a true italian fine dining experience with a world class italian chef and waiters knowledgeable in wines

an absolute must for anyone who wants a taste of italy in the heart of picturesque shanghai, risotto was excellent pizza good but not as terrific as goodfellas potatoes delicious service was solid nice night out but would choose other restaurants next time, wanting a nice cup of real italian espresso i went to atto primo late at night last saturday
turns out they also had baba and me loving cakes had one
best cake ive tried in years
together with a espresso dopio and a 16 yo lagavullin i was in heaven
the ambience and service i got will make a regular, this place is amazing my friends and i had to meet up on friday night but we didnt book any table we called at 930pm and the girl accepted to book a table for us near the window with the beautiful view on the bund
the gnocchis were fabulous and the manager participated to the birthday surprise of my friends

i hope i come back there soon, the restaurant was very nice with an atmosphere as theater with a beautiful bund view in an historical building
we ordered bruschetta alicituna risotto and everything was amazing only the vitello tonnato needs improvement for the souce too liquid and for the meat
the food has good size it is well prepared and shown
the only complain is in the water management the waitress cannot continue to fill the glass as the san pellegrino were free and continue to bring to table without asking if we need or not this is a classic mistake that italian people doesnt likenext time let the bottle on the table and it is ok considering that the western water is not cheap
last comment we drank an amazing piedmont beer baladin cuneo province but the waitress take out all the wax around the bottleneck that it is one of the characteristic of this kind of beer so next time let the wax there, wonderful creative dishes luxurious experience knowledgeable staff with perfect english we were taken care of by tess she was fantastic made our last dinner in shanghai very special thank you, great location great food and very good view definitely suggested for both business dinner and a friend gathering, the staff is kind and you dont have to wait a long time to be served
the music is great and you can see the chef cooking delicious dishes 
if you book in advance you can seat near the windows and look the pearl tower swfc and jin mao tower

i met my both friends there and we spent a good and a long time , think very good food with new twists on your favorite meals excellent and well trained staff prime location at the bund with the unbeatable view and an overall very relaxed and yet warm woody atmosphereand there you have atto primo i have been there many times already never disappointed and always left with a smile, i highly recommend atto primo  for the food with excellent chef  for the welcome of the staff in room and the service  of course the price are little bit higher for be on bund but compare to other place in a bund is more than worth it  excellent wines list  you can seat on a high chairs near to the bar and kitchen is more fun and better view of the full restaurant  we will back for sure , has a great ambiance on arrival showing a warm homely decor and lots of wood furnishings clearly time and effort has been put into the place the staff are well trained and an authentic italian chef was there to manage the customary open plan kitchen
that night i only ate finger food and noticed the alacarte menu was full of usual italian foods for fine dining in shanghai i felt overall the restaurant is ideal for lunch time business meals or on a date for the evening and for this reason i will return soon, atto primo on bund 5 is a true gem in the dining scene in shanghai i have been visiting the restaurant since the opening and it has never disappointed and always exceeded my and my guests expectations chef and patron gianluca is a true host and excellent chef who has created a restaurant experience that is very special the type of cuisine goes beyond the classic and boring italian fare you would find in any average restaurant stricci pasta agnelotti etc to name a few are elements of his menu he is an excellent host that would stay behind to close down the restaurant after each guest is leaving  noactually he would extend the operation hours to make sure you have a good time this restaurant is one of the few that i always recommend without any hesitation and always get great feedback back, we had a beautiful dinner starting with home made zucchini and chicken in carpione followed by vitello tonnato mushroom risotto and then a delicious chocolate pear dessert the torino smash cocktail is a must good service and great location will definitely come back special thanks to the chef and to the event manager they really made a special night for us in shanghai, the food is very good i am very fussy with oysters but they were prefect the scallops with foie gras and mushrooms is a very well balanced dish and the deserts have a good mix of complimentary flavours baeutiful all the food we had was excellent and our waitress was very good and friendly with big industrial windows there are good view which you would expect from the location if you are looking for high end italian food with good service in central shanghai this is the place to go

the restaurant is easy to find although not well signed from the outside the entrance is just around the corner from the bund on guangdong road bellow m on the bund there is normally a little crowd outside waiting for taxis, our friends brought us here for dinner one night and we have been coming back since introducing it to other friends the food here is superb and each dish is excellently executed the restuarant might not be as flashy as some of the other well known restuarants on the bund but so far it has delivered consistently on great food and taste in a comfortable dining room with a view on the huangpu most definitely a hidden gem on the bund the area for improvement is the dessert menu i guess after such greatness on the appertisers and main dishes one naturally expect greatness to the end nonetheless well keeping coming and hoping they have a great bar for predinner drinks also, it is a rather new location in the building of 3 on the bund on wei tan next to guandong lu  the media and onine searches will tell you that it is the first trial of yum group owner of kfc and other fast food chains to enter the premium fb market one would assume that a large global food conglemerate invests in such a prime location with the readiness and ambition to make it perfect  either as pr venue or as testing ground for a new concept  but the result is mamahuhuoverall it is a dittle darkish mellow club sound infused  roughly 150 places clubd restaurant bund style like jean george   the ambition would be good for your first date great for a refreshing night as a couple or nice fancy but relaxed place to show off to your friends  but things are not that great 

good things to say is the great face value
 good views on lujiazui
 darkish interior with scandinavian 60s inspired furniture  similar to the glam bar in the same building
 really mouth wathering italian menu with a lot of modernized itlailan regional dishes and also pizza  pasta as a nice combination of traditonal homestyle origins with the culinary premium ambition to make those dishes more fancy and subtle
 caring and considerate service
 good cocktail list
 good wine list but which is a little polar  but as we are in shanghai  decent three rmb digit basics but quick jump into four digits into stuff that are just a little better than basics


now the downsides 
taking the bundlike prices execution is much less a pleasure
 cocktail composition were shanghailike biased toward the lower cost ingredients melted too warm ice cubesm sirup and lemon juice in order to have some savings on the spirits  i had a good sounding classic martinez which was much too sweet
 we had an excellent starter to share a fried sandwich with mozarella and anchovies the crust was perfect  but not enough cheese  the overall taste if you spared to bite into the too dry crust was excellent
 as main we had an excellent side to share cauliflower with garliccapres which was very good  still bity and a lot of rich flavour
 my wife had gnochi with bacon  tomato and capre this was bland despite the cooking of the pasta was perfect but seemed that this potential delicious dish had been prepared by someone without taste buds
 i had fried sardines with raisin pine etc a kind of the legendary sarde saor without pasta but with oversized sarde this dish was completly off  the rolled sarde were oversized like a german rollmops and slighty heated the impact of the pine and the few raisins was zero a really bad dish with a lack of umami and a too punchy acidity  a strange texure and the lack of completing flavour  despite the announced ingredients it was actually bland and toatally overpriced and actually nearly bad because this heated sour brined fish was really strange
as dessert we shared a kind of baba au rum with some trimmings which was ok but not perfect too soaky too sweet not enouh whipped cream other timmings a little down on the taste  a kind of lemon curd was a little strange

so overall if you do not take care on your budget or have free float fapiao simply try it as maybe i had the wrong draw regarding the day it was monday but if you are more budget concious wait to get better feedback i hope this will happen soon as it is a really nice location, we had a fabulous dinner here excellent food without the pomposity of fine dining attractive venue and a wide choice of food items we particularly enjoyed the chicken liver terrine and the gnocchi would happily return, i visited atto primo in shanghai in several occasions it has never disappointed me for quick lunch breaks they have an amazing set lunch with lots of delicious italian dishes buffet style
i have also been many times at dinner time  the location overlooking the skyline of the bund is truly beautiful  but the major difference between atto primo and most of the other bund restaurants  italian and non  is that the food here truly is awesome authentic and tasty 
last time i was there we had an amazing fusilli alla puttanesca farinata alla genovese the pizza is one of the best in town fresh cheeses imported from italy and lots more  every dish is homemade
chef gianluca and his team always prepare everything with a lot of care and attention to detail and even sometimes i requested some dishes not on the menu  they always prepared and delivered top food
i strongly recommend atto primo for real italian high quality and not overpriced food as well as very good people and service, i have been there for dinner and ordered a pizza and veal  impossible to eat
after paying the bill they asked me to fill a form where i confirmed the food was not so good but no one cared about it
i left my mobile number on that form and some italian guy working there just sent me a message that i should complain face to face  yes sure  if somebody came to my table i will for sure  maybe he has no idea about customer relation dear guys of attoprimo if you want to survive in shanghai you should improve service and find a new chef maybe somebody able to cook and not trying to keep relations , very good food service and atmosphere
best value for money
you must take the dessert i attached, the food quality is truly outstanding highly recommend this to those visiting shanghai and craving for italian cuisine, we were directed to another nearby italian restaurant by the hotel concierge but were advised by a shanghai resident giovanni to try this place it turned out to be utterly fantastic from the oysters to the agnolotti to the excellent steak and cannoli

and the ownerchef couldnt have been more gracious as was the entire service staff

a treat to be sure worth going back to for sure, i visited this place three or four times now but now i would write a review for it its definitely one of the nicer italian restaurants in the city chef is always accommodating because we have a small child pasta is freshly cooked and freshly prepared i can recommend the vitello tonnato, we had a fantastic meal here wonderfully prepared italian traditional dishes  so good i was surprised that i had not heard of this restaurant before as good or better than more famous restaurants on the bund on top of that a great view and very attentive staff, it was our first time to atto primo the atmosphere and the service are absolutely perfect the staff and the manager are very attentive always having an eye on your needs

we ordered a starter to share which is a pretty big portion the pizza very big to is almost to much for one person when you combine it with a big starterthe sweet little something  apple pie at the end was really delicious

towards the end i ordered a double espresso when it came just being curios i asked the staff weather this is a single or a double she went away to check and came back with the chef and another espresso he explained to me everything there is to know about an double espresso  no seriously i asked only to make sure and received another double on the house
by the way the complimentary grappa at the endthats what gives them the full score its the small things that make the big difference

i really can recommend this place even if a bit pricyits in a prime location with a wonderful view on the bund, the restaurant located on the bund with amaizing view gave us fantastic italian atmosphere staff is outgoing and useful but most of all we were inspired of the taste of dishes  scallops and duck liver with black truffle and risotto  you just have to try it great place for great evening, incredibly tasty food for the first time tasted so delicious pizza  roasted lamb was perfect cooked the interior is very comfortable the atmosphere is pleasantthe staff is friendly i was sitting with a friend and did not notice how time flew  from now on everyone will recommend this place, whether you go for a date or a business meeting this venue meets all your expectations chic bund atmosphere authentic italian cuisine and proper service i would recommend everyone to try their carne cruda and mushroom risotto since i ve been living in shanghai for more then 4 years and been spoiled by all varieties of restaurants i have found atto primo as one of my fav to go places special thanks to the amazing chef gianluca and manager naya who make this place unresistable","hot pot house",0.999767312088249
73,"had a great night out here celebrating my sisters birthday all ingredients were beautiful as was the wine vie de romans sauvignon blanc they have a solid perhaps not super original list leonardos service was professional attentive amusing and generous i will return whenever i am in shanghai and have replenished my bank account not a super cheap place, business dinner the attention to detail and the expertise of the staff is astonishing we enjoyed the dinner very much we stayed a bit longer than the dinner to discuss and we would never have wanted to leave that place i strongly advise you to try the black truffle ice cream with meringues and melanosporum truffle never had a better dessert in my life, one true indicator that you at the right place for excellent italian food is  when the italian president walks in for dinner 
but this small additional experience was only the last piece to make it perfect 

there is nothing which from my point of view could have been done to make it better the setup  the interior and the service are perfect
the food is a class by them self from simple food like eggs with truffles to complex food everything is to the point and never overdone

so if you are in for the treat  this is the place to go , come back to our favorite restaurant in shanghai with friends
as usual everything was perfect from the great team of gian luca to the amazing dishes
amazing choice of wine, if you look for a place to wow your significant other or impress a business partner pamper your guests or just treat yourself to some well deserved treatsthis is the place to go
everything starting with the locations the restaurants pleasing decor the warm welcome to the perfect professional and yet not overwhelming service is excellent the food however us nothing but out of this world and if you try the tasting menu with wine pairing you will get the best of both worlds
you may expect the price tag of a michelin starred restaurant but it is worth every penny
we will surely return, been there on tuesday what an experience great atmosphere but most importante the food was divine as a start suggest you ask for a soup that contains truffle and mushrooms main course go for the colorado lamb desert take a turtle ice cream the service was outstanding ask for wanessa very knowledgable and friendly she has complemented the lovely night we had on the warning side portions are small and restaurant is pricey nevertheless worth the experience will for sure return and do recommend, when you are in shanghai and like to enjoy great italian food  this the placethe pasta with truffel is above deliciousalso staff and atmosfere are 3 star levelfor sure on my next visit i look forward to visit again, my husband and i love otto e mezzo we love it so much weve been back pretty much every week since discovering it about a month back the food is consistently excellent and the limoncello souffle is beyond excellent after a long hard week at work the food here makes the shoulders come down from the ears and puts a smile on your face

they also make my 5 year old daughter feel so welcome which is such a change from the usual formal fine dining my daughter loves chef ricardos bolognese, we arrived for lunch without a booking and made very welcome we had been walking and opted to cool down with a drink at the bar there is a very good drinks list including an extensive wine list
when deciding to order we noticed that the set menu didnt offer paired wines but our waitperson was very accomadating with pairing them for us her name escapes me but she is philipino and was fantastic during our lunch experience if you are a truffle fan this is your place and wont be dissapointed there were no standout dishes as they were all high class

we will definitely be back guys thanks for the excetpional experience, the manager leo took excellent care of our group we started at the bar where we had some of the best wine ive ever had at his recommendation he also served us some spicy nuts and italian olives then we moved to a table the view of the bund was excellent and the restaurant was clean and comfortable atmosphere was slightly more formal i had a pasta dish rigatoni with a ragu that was exceptional one of the other guests at our table had an excellent truffle soup the portion size was perfect  just like in italy the chef also had some tasty little dessert bites for the end of the meal an overall excellent dining experience, we loved our dinner there the food is exceptional the service friendly and view of pudong wonderful i can only recommend this dinner experience the taste of the dishes is as good as the cooking of the best kitchens in italy go but go with an empty stomach and the eat and eat heavenly, the best italian restaurant in town foods and service really outstanding one of the best food experience in the world of fine dining bravi, oki have had the privilege to have some amazing dining experiences around the world and no matter how good it takes a lot for me to rate something a 5 there was no doubt this dining experience would get a 5

i was dining with a work colleague on a business trip in shanghai we found otto e mezzo through a basic search close to the hotel easy walk not easy to find it is on an upper floor of a building that looks like it could house businesses or apartments of both you have to take the elevator up and it is a tiny elevator

we did not have a reservation we were greeted warmly and openly they said a table for 2 would be available shortly and they guided us to the bar we had a glass of wine and even before we could finish it we were seated they transferred the bar tab to the main bill nice

an absolutely beautiful dining room and the aroma from the kitchen was exquisite it was truffle season and that amazing truffle smell filled the air

the service was impeccable from start to finish not stuffy proper polite professional prompt but not rushed

we ordered a bottle of red from the very extensive and excellent wine list very global

a vegetarian amuse bouche was an excellent way to get the palate started the bread that came to the table was delicious addictive

my colleague had the colorado lamb chop and i had the tagliolini with mushrooms and truffle cream the presentation was amazing you eat with all of your other senses first before anything goes in your mouth the crowning moment was when they shaved fresh truffles on top of my pasta omg yes i put an omg in my review my colleague devoured his lamb chop the wine was perfect with both dishes

we ordered dessert the chocolate variation and the tiramisu but before that we were treated to a palate cleanser that would have been dessert in most places the after dinner drinks were the perfect compliment a sherry and a port

i have eaten at several 1 michelin star restaurants and a few 2 star never a 3 star as those are few and far between there are less than 150 in the world as far as i am concerned this was 3 star, i made a reservation on their website a week or so in advance and received a confirmation text message
when we arrived there the day of the reservation the hostess told me that they had a private event and could not seat us
while i understand that there was an event they should then not have confirmed my reservation in the first place
i guess the lesson is do not rely on their website to make a reservation and instead make a phone call
also the restaurant should fix their online reservation system, its right around the corner from the peninsula and just off the bund the two managing partners were both there and are from italy and could not have been nicer its a high end place but the chef still comes out to chat and ask about your meal the food was outstanding and the wine that they chose for us was perfect i will definitely be back, 8 12 bombana was a pleasant surprise this time in shanghai one of the best italian restaurants in shanghai behind the peninsula hotel in shanghai and close to the river with amazing views over the financial district
leonardo the general manager did a great job and his and his people service was outstanding
the food was really good from the starters to the pasta and the deserts very well cooked well served and well explained to realize what you will eat
if you are there ask leonardo to take you to the roof terrace and enjoy the sight it is impressive and a great place for a drink or a coffee after dinner
good job for the whole team, the food at otto e mezzo is outstanding  as is the wine list the reputation for this restaurant is well earned and while it is very expensive it is because of the detail applied to every item on the plate the servings are small but each taste is an experience for a special occasion it is a must visit  but book ahead as it is generally full, it is very pricey but the food was fabulous as was the service the views are great  if the weather is nice the outdoor terrace is incredible very good wine list we took a car from our hotel and it was a little hard to find as the restaurant is on a pedestrian mall, this is one of the best italian restaurants we have been to in the world away from italy fine dining to change things up from all the chinese food excellent service ambiance and extensive wine menu

reservations recommended as the place is busy with locals and celebrities, been here on a few special occasions and have had most of their menu items which are quite limited but typical of a finedining restaurant food quality is superb but unless you are specifically going for the seasonal menu their offerings can be jaded quite quickly asked the chef for a degustation or his own creations once and ended up eating the same signature dishes again, great food great service beautiful space weve been here a few times and hands down has the best pasta in china the scampi carpaccio was simply delicious, easy reservations by phone nice table as requested on a very short notice very good dishes although pricey excellent service a place to keep for a special occasion nice view different from other bund locations, we loved this restaurant the service from start to finish was fabulous the food itself was amazing we had three courses and loved every single thing we ate the outdoor bar has a great view to the bund if you love refined italian food with outstanding service and a fantastic view then this place is for you we did get engaged over dinner so that did add to the occasion the staff did a great job keeping the surprise from me and ensuring it was a special night for us thank you, the corporate dinner event we held in otto e mezzo bombana shanghai after shanghai grand prix with our clients was very success the cocktail session after dinner was awesome very professional indeed, riccardo is the most talented chef ive ever had the chance to encounter taste presentation and satisfaction were off the chart prices a little high but definitely worth it, finally a real highend restaurant in china
real authentic italian cuisine with a twist of sophistication i love it as much as i love the restaurant atmosphere and its outstanding view on the bund
service was as excellent as in highend restaurants in western countries which is really something nearly impossible to find in china
finally a place that deserve the money it charges
absolutely a really wonderful dining experience, i have been invited to the restaurant few days ago for the 4th year anniversary of the place it was my first time there and the dinner was mindblowing the tasting menu was composed of 7 dishes and it would truly be impossible for me to say which one was the best as everything was really tasty black truffle was the theme and even the dessert was composed of a black truffle ice cream best part of the night was to see the manager slicing the black truffle on each plate 
service was attentive without being interruptive bread basket and wine were top up when needed without requesting it
great experience and one of the best dinner i had in shanghai, exquisite italian food in the heart of shanghai the pasta was as good as any weve ever had the sauces were layers of flavor and quite lovely the wine list was good and diverseamong the best weve seen in china the staff were knowledgeable and attentive all together wonderful, its usually a good sign that a restaurant isnt doing well when on a saturday night less than a third of the tables are full the place was empty the view was amazing and the service was very good but i have to say for a place that specializes in truffles the quality was absolutely mediocre

the fresh black truffle pasta which i paid nearly 500 rmb for a small plate for tasted and smelled like fresh cardboard from a paper recycling plant

for a place that claims thats its chef is deserving of 3 michelin stars one would be shocked at the poor quality of the food the entire meal was uneventful completely average if even that

maybe the chef should have his friends visit and give an honest opinion

we went to jean georges mercato the next night completely packed the food was marvelous and the bill was exactly 13 of the prior night

save your money for good truffles in italy and france or hk, great food and amazed preparation fabulous wine and excellent service the only concern is the price which is really too high we spent 200 � each for a normal dinner with wine that is really too much, made a complain on the pasta being undercooked got the egotistic reply back without even sending the dish back for tasting saying that it was how it should be

we have explained that its not al dente its crunchy and i eventually gave up on communication and just shared my friends dish later on the waiter came to apologise and the kitchen made us a new dish which is then al dente the chef was out socially at one point but never came to our table

very disappointed as it does not live up to its name, very good service received from the italian staff but the prices of the food and wine bear no relation whatsoever to the quality offered 45� for an okay taste but too al dente risotto is not defendable even when youre located just behind the bund try the same in rome and you will be out of business very soon

average audience consists of chinese rich kids who obviously have no interest for high pricing other than that more expensive is probably better

plus service as mentioned location the view, it was an fantastic experience from service to food from a team at michelin quality our feast was as below and recommend to everybody

1 new zealand scampi carpaccio

2 italian risotto carnaroli

3 roasted pacific ocean codfish

4 almond foam

5 classic tiramisu and homemade petit fours with a very well balanced full body tuscany wine

satisfied till our bones thank you guys keep up the good work, in the heart of shanghai i found all the best of italian excellence gentility style unique atmosphere and the incredible taste of the most classic italian dishes masterfully prepared with a genius modern touch definitely the best amatriciana ive ever had, if italian food in shanghai then 8 12 otto e mezzo bombana is a must

outstanding italian fine dining with a great stunning view to the bund the ambiance is very well crafted and the location is ideal for a lovely dinner i enjoyed their great winegrappa selection
what makes this place even more special is the service overall the service was impeccable i will definitely return soon and will enjoy the view from the soon opened rooftop terrace, excellent food presented perfectly paired with a very credible wine list to match short walk from the bund hotels this restaurant is tucked away on quiet side street grab a cocktail in the bar beforeafter you will not be disappointed, i have been wanting to visit this renowned shanghai restaurant for a while and it didn�t disappoint the food was excellent the wine list extensive and the staff were welcoming and knowledgeable leonardo the gm was a particularly great host and he made mine and my guest�s evening a delight any excuse to visit this restaurant would be a good one but it would make for an especially good business dinner nice view too, i was able to make a last minute reservation for late on a sunday night even though i was clearly the last person at the restaurant eating the staff was still so friendly energetic and helpful i did not feel rushed at all even though i am sure everyone probably wanted to go home the food was top notch and the seared foi gras was amazing leonardo the general manager was a great host and gave me some great color on the restaurant the food and the chinese experience this will be the first place i eat when i return to shanghai, everything that this represent is there though some times overworked i usually enjoy it regardless of its finer ingredients with a view outside to match it it is a treat
excellent and attentive service grazie leo, following some pretty ordinary meals in our hotel our concierge recommended 8 12 to us as a more upmarket dining experience being seasoned travelers we were somewhat suspicious so we decided to drop in for a dessert and test the waters
the staff could not have been more friendly and attentive and they ensured that we had a great table a wonderful view of the colorful shanghai skyline and a warm welcome  even for just a dessert
the head chef came out of the kitchen to meet us and he explained in great detail the extent of his wonderful menu and then offered to make additional dishes to specifically cater to my wifes particular vegetarian diet
on the strength of this first impression we booked dinner for the following week but ended up phoning and coming in the following day
we started with at least 3 different housebaked fresh breads served with tasty olive oil and balsamic vinegar
i had the dutch milkfed veal chop which was better than any veal shnitzel i had ever previously eaten anywhere including in melbourne vienna or budapest
my wife had a freshly made vegetarian risotto dish that did not appear on the menu but which the head chef happily prepared to accommodate her requirements
this was accompanied by a fantastic salad that had the most amazing flavor
we shared the pear tart dessert which was simply amazing and my only mistake for the evening  we should have ordered 1 each as it was just too delicious to share but at least my dietitian was pleased with my self restraint
just when we thought we were full we were then served a platter of delicate and delicious petite fours to round off the perfect evening
all through dinner yet without being in any way intrusive the staff checked on us spoke with us and ensured that we were enjoying our dinner  which we did thoroughly
in fact we loved it so much we went back to otto e mezze 2 nights later for our last meal in shanghai before we caught our flight home i had to have the veal chop again whereas my wife had an amazing pasta dish
this is not a budget restaurant  this is the very definition of fine dining and well worth it for anyone like me who appreciates a feinschmeker gourmet meal every now and then, the restaurant is in a very elegant pedestrian street in the north bund with lots of art deco landmarks not far from the garden bridge and from the suzhou creek the location is amazing and you can consider a walk in the area it is behind the peninsula and just in front of the former british consulate before or after going to the restaurant it is also very close to the rockbund museum
one of the best views on shanghai both from the terrace or even indoor if you ask for a table with view recommended around sunset or evening from starters to desserts the cuisine is impressive both for its taste and presentation the staff is very professional and friendly and we often found very good recommendations especially for the wines from leonardo or gianluca chef riccardo laperna has a longstanding career and is very passionate about his work if you have a chance try to have a word with him to know more about his cuisine
average price for a dinner eur 100150 worth the experience
also recommended for a drink before or after dinner on the terrace opened during the summer, what great treatsuperb lunchstarting in great and welcome atmosphereeach course pass my aspectiongreat quality ingredients manipulate in the right manners and top nouch presentation
sow happy about my choice in shanghai of 8 12 mezzo bombana
ps stunning view of the bund is plus
see you on my next buisness trip
grazie mille, had a nice dinner here got a very nice table with a nice view seemed like private dining we went with the set course dinner which was not cheap but value for money its not the best italian food i ever had but the atmosphere and great service made it a great experience, visited again yesterday again it didnt disappoint leo and his team provided excellent and suitably attentive service for a solo diner the chestnut soup was autumnal and simply excellent i knew i just had to order it when i saw it on the menu and was impressed spanish king prawn fettuccine and beef dishes were also good extensive italian wine list as you would expect which satisfied my tastes would highly recommend and i will visit again when i visit shanghai again, went with my parents dad ordered foie gras and risotto mom ordered shrimp scampi and lobster tagliatelle i ordered prosciutto and we all shared a 1200g bonein ribeye ordered a bottle of sangiovese+cab sauv blend from tuscany food was really good especially the steak pasta was a little soft but i figured they probably did it on purpose because chinese people wouldnt like european al dente
they have an impressive wine list from traditional italian wine to super tuscan
good dinning experience, we were expecting to pay a lot given the background of this place we decided to give it a go on the basis of the good reviews

the wine list was extensive and slightly overwhelming but we settled on a good value german riesling at 400 yuan

we both had the burrata stuffed ravioli and although the portion size was small it was very tasty

for dessert we decided to share the lemon meringue tart whilst it was pricey at 200 yuan it was honestly the best lemon tart we have tasted

we were presently surprised with the little extras served between each course and this definitely compensated for the high price

we just did one course shared a dessert and with one bottle of wine it came to 1100 yuan

it was a memorable meal and although we wouldnt visit each month we couldnt afford to we would return for the good quality and innovative food combinations the interior and ambience makes it a meal to remember, we had apperitivo on the roof very nice view on the city and the bund big choice of cocktails then went back one floor down to the restaurant room very nice decoration and professional staff excellent wine list lot of choices
food quality and freshness is awesome the chef really knows how to cook traditional italian with a modern touch
portion are a bit small though and also a bit overpriced in general but we are in china and some ingredients are more costly to bring from europe, returned here twice within a week as the food quality was only average on the first time and thought maybe the chef had an off day however on the second time the food quality really had dropped will most probably not return again, we love this place  we went a lot to this place during our stay in town since they opened unfortunately after 5 years we are moving on and will definitely miss this place

outstanding service
very yummy food and delicious cocktails

if you go here you must try their pasta, i have been here in august with my wife for dinner we were lucky to met chef riccardo which gave us the best recommendations we had 5 course set menu with wines paring it was excellent","dumpling restaurant",0.999089995400826
74,"went for dinner and i must say it was amazing the restaurant itself the view over the bund very very nice experience and most important the food and service extremely high standard, visited the cathay room for a second time this past friday evening for dinner with work colleagues service and food is absolutely excellent the view of pudong is nothing short of spectacular would highly recommend for special occasions or dinners for great impressions, i was there on my own and still enjoyed the classic menu with local offerings

do try the basic salad  it was amazing

the hairy crabs are in season and are not to miss

the experience was classic chinese the service was impeccable the ambiance was elegant the food superb

i think all in as i had a 3 course meal with wine $60 usd

i highly recommend this, we stayed at the fairmont which is recently restored to its historic grandeur the restaurant was a pleasant surprisewe went for the view but loved the service the food was very good and reasonably priced were returning for peking duck tonight, beautiful setting wonderful view excellent food good service what a delightful evening location to share with friends, food we went there for lunch you can choose 35 courses very tasty
service all good and very helpful you can reserve your table online
design dont expect its a modern design or very spacious  peace hotel is an old historical building
view you can go to the balcony to look at the views of the bund and pudong skyline afterwads amazing view, the cathay room in the peach fairmount hotel offers a delicious set lunch menu with lovely views of pudong a great place for a ladies lunch or business dining the beau arts style of the restaurant is charming and provides intimate spaces for discussion in a bright environment attentive service as well, after eating chinese food for fifteen days while touring china we treated ourselves for a good solid three course dinner at the cathay room with views overlooking the bund and pudong skyline i had egg salad followed by rack of lamb then carrot cake with ice cream it was all presented beautifully and so delicious add to that the most amazing views of shanghai then it is a winning combination the service was very good  the waiters were friendly and accommodating they didnt mind it when i asked them to take our photo we were allowed to go on the balcony to take photos of the bund and pudong skyline  it was such a lovely experience weve always like fairmont chains such as the fairmont olympic in seattle and the savoy in london weve always had very good experiences with the chain, first of all the setting is not as romantic as i would have thought its quite a small room and the view from the inside is hard to comment on however if you are here with a big group ready to have fun then it could be a memorable brunch because the champagne keeps on flowing in terms of food i liked the salad bar and the dessert bar the seafood bar was also very nice they even had fresh uni you can get food from the buffet and main course can be ordered a la carte if you are here though step outside and take advantage of the best view there is in shanghai the staff were very nice and friendly theres free wifi just ask for the password, sat outside for a quick meal and enjoyed the views of the bund at night it was worth going up just for that food was good and the service excellent loved the big rattan chairs, first of all the hotel is beautiful and the view is amazing the buffet choice is very wide and ingredients fresh atmosphere is quite and relaxed we loved every single dish well go back to celebrate other family occasions, the restaurant has many positives visavis location view ambience quality of food etc but one attribute that completely stands out is their attitude whereby they try and satisfy their clients needs completely we walk into the restaurant at a time when they were taking their last order we also had a few special requests they made us feel completely at home even though we landed at the last minute and took care of the minutest of details an right through our dinner it was service with a smile the food was amazing we would recommend the sea bass which was absolutely yum, great dining place with easy access to the bund wai tan scenery nice service nice dining environment very french style, you shall visit the restaurant ff you wish to enjoy the great view with fantastic food
the menu is exquisite and staff very attentive, the menu is very high end western dishes service is outstanding attentive not pushy and very knowledgeable
expensive in line with fine dining but reasonable great wine selection, seriously just come for the view the food is very very good as well probably not the best meal you can find in shanghais higher end but still great produce we had a local fish and imported lamb thorough wine offering good service quiet what a view, european food truly excellent but not cheap c <u+00a3>60 per head for 2 courses ex drinks suckling pig brilliant wine <u+00a3>50bottle, gorgeous restaurant in a spectacular hotel beautiful view of the pudong skyline the dishes and drinks however fail to give the same level of excitement everythings fine just not great, only stayed in shanghai for 4 nights and came here twice as the food was absolutely gorgeous fine dining presented beautifully and tasting divine wonderful beef tenderloin and great views efficient but unobtrusive service highly recommend this lovely restaurant, the decor in the cathay room is understated though the view of pudongs skyscrapers certainly makes up for it my pork tenderloin was unimpressive as was the pasta one of my companions had though other members of our party enjoyed their beef medallions, best service best meal in shanghai best views at night from the terrace with a cocktail in hand black cod as well as the tenderloin steak cooked to perfection plating was truly a work of art, lovely lunch  food good but not great but could value for the set lunch enjoyed the views and atmosphere, i was looking for a restaurant to have a nice dinner with a good view of the pearl tower and the cathy room has it all the hotel staff was extremely helpful and attentive he ushered me to the restaurant to make my reservation and when i arrived he escorted me there too the restaurant manager was polite and also helpful and offered good suggestions on food choices the food was delicious and we had a nice bottle of wine price was reasonable the experience was absolutely memorable i will visit again if i return to shanghai might even try staying in the hotel too thanks, we chose sunday brunch at the fairmont peace hotel as it was highly recommended what a treat the venue is elegant with great views over the city and the river french champagne was on tap we had a small caviar starter served to the table there was a small selection of cooked dishes that you could order from the kitchen but the buffet tables were more than adequate fresh oysters alaskan crabprawns mussels cured meats from all over the worldand loads more this is a leisurely experiencedo not do this if you are short of time the sweets selection was also amazing some of the puddings did run out i was disappointed by this but there really was more than enough to console me a five star experience, after a long few days absorbing extraordinary sights and tastes decided a late supper in the hotel restaurant the easy option it was easy friendly unobtrusive service low light with epic views of the river a whistling wind on a stormy night the food was flawless in taste proportion and delivery crab cakes black herb cod exceptional great wine selection and possibly most surprising not exorbitantly priced as you might expect in an iconic five star hotel, we have been to many fine dining restaurants in shanghai and i chose cathay room this time the decotation is fantastic and the food there is amazing i did enjoy the beef tenderloin while my friend thought the lamb rack was the best special thanks to lilith a chinese girl with lovely smile and sincere atittude her anticipation and attentive service did made us feel special the cheese cake she recommended to us was fabulors we will come back next time for sure~, the starter are not fantastic had better lobster bisque the beef is greatly done to my liking the herb black cod was cooked nicely i had the grace vine chairman reserved 2011 not greatso so not worth the price paying 15 service charge is high man, came back to the cathay room on my recent stay in shanghai menus changed for the winter season but the food is still fantastic had great service from becky ordered the duck confit appetizer and the sea bass for main course and they were awesome cant say enough about this restaurant, this should have been a great meal the service was attentive and friendly from my table i had a great view of the shanghai skyline the wind had even cooperated and blown all the pollution away the decor was nice the presentation on all the dishes was excellent even the portions were perfect ie not too large

they just missed one thing flavor the amuse bouche was an attractive little tomato thing but the tomato seemed flavorless and crunch a safeway tomato the caesar salad i know who orders a caesar salad in shanghai but i was desperate for some fresh greens and it was the only salad on the menu looked good but had a bit of an unpleasant aftertast the chicken was also pretty flavorless and the green puree surrounding it looked nice but just what was it peas i presume also the chicken was described as crispy in the menu but there seemed to be nothing crisp about it maybe they meant grizzly

the carrot cake made a nice desert but was not enough to make up for the rest of the meal

the other thing about this restaurant is you need to be prepared to sell a child once the bill arrives but that is shanghai  at lunch i passed on a small bottle of san pellegrino at $18 youll have to sell two if you have wine with dinner just extrapolate the san pellegrino to a bottle of wine, the food was outrageously good and the views are the best of the bund wonderful flavor global flavors with a european focus combinations and care to create a special night they accommodated my need for gluten free food celiac and were attentive from the beginning to end of our dining experience, excellent steak dinner with outstanding service from becky great views from the windows and out on the terrace the salad was crisp and the roasted pptatoes with rosemary wetr delicious, this was the restaurant chosen for the final dinner of the apt 23 day tour of china located on the 9th level of the fairmont peace hotel its position could not be better from the restaurant there are excellent views of the illuminated bund and the masses thronging along the area

there is seating available both inside and on an outside terrace

wait staff were impeccably attired and courteous and we were quickly and efficiently shown to our table on arrival

we had all pre chosen the menu with the majority going for a sweet pumpkin soup a fillet steak and a dessert the steaks in particular were perfectly cooked and very juicy approx 200 grams which is plenty

in the same room was a much larger and clearly a business type group and for whatever reason that group seemed to get all the service attention we calculated that our three courses were served and cleared in no longer than 45 minutes we needed to attract the attention of one of the waiters as one of the fish dishes for our party was quite under cooked it took some minutes to get his attention as he seemed more occupied with the business table by the time the fish had been cooked adequatelyor replaced the remainder of the table had finished the main course furthermore once the initial drinks had been served not once did a waiter return to offer more drinks or even top up the water glasses

this quite poor service lever detracted from the wonderful food decor view and experience of dining at the cathy room, me and my husband had a great dinning experiencenothing could have made our experience betterthe food was fabthe wine list is great alsowe were served by becky yang who went out her way to help us choose from the menu nothing was to much trouble for her and even tho it was busy she made sure that we were attended towould go for the dinner then followed with the live jazz downstairsonly wish we could go again, was back at this restaurant in peace hotel on the bund everytime in shanghai i like to come here great food dinner menu is contemporary and a great seasonal menu from chef jeremy who even remebered my gf and i from a previous dinner they have a wine expert in the restaurant who is also very personable overall a great restaurant expensive but cheaper than some of the bund alternatives and the cathay room has a better view and the food is on point with the more famous restaurants on the bund, whilst doing the tourist route on the magnificent bund the iconic peace hotel with its history and decor seemed to be the right place to have lunch
the interior of the hotel is a feast to your eyes in its own right however we noticed that the cathay room on the 9 th floor had a lunch offer
the offer of 2 courses for <u+00a5>230 was the most amazing fine dining lunch ever with a glass of wine included in the price the restaurant is immaculate as is the service and the view from the balcony is breathtaking dont hesitate to eat here its fabulous and worth every yuan, the views on the rooftop restaurant are spectacular we went around 600 and had no trouble getting a table we enjoyed a lovely dinner expensive but thats kind of the tradeoff for the views we stayed until it got dark which gave us even better views of the shanghai skyline even if you just stop by for a drink you dont want to miss the views, we celebrated our anniversary at the central balcony table the staff was amazing we got a dessert on the house as they know that we were celebrating i got everything arranged with the manager named anthony and our waitress monica was great i highly recommend it, i was looking forward to going to what is one of the most beautiful hotels in shanghai to eat sunday brunch however was slightly disappointed the staff although very friendly were inattentive and we had to keep asking for glasses to be refilled the restaurant wasnt busy so this couldnt be used as an excuse
the food on offer was very good but i have had better choices in cheaper establishments this was a very expensive lunch and i feel it was not value for money
also on the website they advertise a digestive after your bruch this was not offered and when we asked we were told no however they relented and brought us a digestive my friend ordered a cointreau and when they brought it they said the orange liqueur it was not cointreau although did not know what it was it was grand marnier this proving staff knowledge not up to the standard of establishment this is, we had a reservation of window seat but when we got there no seat by the window is available so we waited as the hostess told us a couple would leave soon but when we came back the seats were given out by the manager it would have been not a so big deal but we thought how they handled it was not like how a 5 star hotel restaurant would do it kinda already ruined our mood but then the starter were very basic yet the mains were good
we came here to admire the historical building but dining with less money and better food could be easily found elsewhere in shanghai, this place is luxurious and worth dressing up for we had the prix fix lunch menu which included a glass of wine and the price was reasonable for such a fine place our first course was lobster bisque with roe crab and shrimp served very hot my wife had two very nice lamb chops and i had perfectly tender duck breast our desserts tiramisu and grand marnier brulee were deconstructed and very attractively arranged
service was impeccable that is prompt friendly responsive and professional
the view from our window seat was spectacular with a slowmotion ballet of the ships plying the river and the stunning pudong skyscrapers on the far side we had our hotel concierge make our reservation for us and that may have helped us score the perfect table
a very pleasant touch was a visit to our table by the dining room manager she encouraged us to visit traditional chinese parts of the city and try local shanghai food she wrote the names of local places for us in english and chinese to help us find them
the restaurant is in the peace hotel a marvel built in 1929 take extra time to look around the hotel and have a drink in the refined jasmine room before or after your meal at the cathay room, had a drink out on the deck and then a beautiful meal with a group of colleagues the quality of the food attentive staff and beautiful decor are simply the best a must try in shanghai, of course the building and the atmosphere is amazing yes visiting shanghai you have been here

but

the food in general and the overall service of the restaurant could improve a little it is good but not top taking this review into consideration the prices are high

but let me be clear this restaurant is absolutely not bad, we booked our table before we even fly to shanghai we received a personal email confirmation which was great we were welcomed by staff as soon as we had set foot in the hotel the service was very good although i know mandarin my husband and i spoke to the staff in english they had no trouble understanding us also they were courteous and professional
the food was good quality but nothing wow the speed of service was also average not too slow as soon as we had sat down our wait staff welcomed us to go out on the balcony to take pictures other wait staff near by volunteered to take picture of my husband and i they were patient and helpful the view to the bund at night was just amazing looking down and see how crowded the bund area was we were glad that we had chosen this location our picture of the bund had no photobombers that is priceless, the worst ever diner on the bund i and my boyfriend was shocked by overpriced food and poor services
 champagne by he glass without bubbles inside
 seafood looks great but totally tasteless
 service staffs did not speak good english thats fine but once were served wrong food probably from another table the waiter just realized and quickly moved it to the right table rather than apology first
 i had to ask for the dessert menu 10 minutes after our main courses were removed
 espresso not strong enough

theres hundred restaurants onnear the bund where you still be able to see the view same money you pay better value you experience, our meal here was fantastic having read some of the recent reviews i was slightly worried but i found the service to be great and at a great pace unlike many restaurants in china we didnt have to either wait hours between courses or have the next course arriving during or even worse before the previous course the food quality was fantastic portions were on the smaller side but to be honest we found ouselves perfectly satisfied it is a little pricey especially the wine selections but we found it to be worth it especially for a special occasion, kitchen provides super slow service in delivering the food its even taking longer time than a taxi in shanghai wait staffs were trying hard many junior staffs are very kind but obviously missed up a good training from the management
we left with a broken heart, this is definitely a place to take someone you want to impress my husband and i were in shanghai over valentines day and decided to go here they opened up the terrace so we could see the bund from outside which was lovely
anthony wu the manager took excellent care of us
the menu was set but the food was all delicious it was 5 courses including dessert and they gave us champagne and roses the timing was pretty good the service was great and the atmosphere was lovely, for a fairmont iconic hotel in shanghai the menu really looks like a perfect match

great views and stately decor

nice and friendly staff who have great intentions but unfortunately tonight the kitchen staff was slow on the orders

pacing was too slow between starters and main though i recommend the main courses the flavors overall were not as good as the menu might suggest

for price and value this is not a hotel restaurant to return to, our party of 3 sneaked into the fairmont peace hotel to admire the building and interiors i had stayed there before renovations some 15 years ago and then maybe 8 years ago and it is quite magnificent we wanted to admire the view from the roof terrace so took the lift up to the 8th floor where we stumbled across the cathay room hunger overtook us so in we went
what a magnificent room the view out of the windows of the bund and pearl tower are sensational especially from the outdoor terrace which we managed to sneak out on  all bund balconies currently closed by decree of the government we think because of the awful stampede on nye but possibly because it is cold

we could not believe that for such a beautiful restaurant we 3 were the only ones there the service was outstanding and the food divine we paid 238rmbabout 40aud for a special lunch menu  2 courses and a glass of wine

what a wonderful place to step back into the past  yet eat superbly the girls and i decided this is absolutely a mustdo experience in shanghai

for colonial history buffs check out their small museum with relics from their past on the way out, my husband and i recently enjoyed a magnificent evening at the cathay room to celebrate our anniversary i had booked well in advance and we had a window table with superb views up and down the bund we both thought the food was well presented and delicious the staff were very attentive and friendly and took photos for us we thoroughly enjoyed our evening here in this magnificent hotel","Italian cuisine",0.999679324554493
75,"was so excited to try this place but turned out below average even the juices got no flavour the starters were bland the main was not tasty at all i didnt know the salad can be this yucky well the service was good, i have no idea how we havent eaten in pure and whole before but here we are we found this place online and excitedly rushed over to try the new for us veggie place location of the restaurant is awesome on nanjing rd in the courtyard of shanghai center the place is on a small side but cozy and quiet we ordered a veggie paella kale and quinoa salad fried bean paddies and bali drink all were exquisite the paella was very colorful and attractive looking though the taste was a bit plain otherwise the food and the service were awesome and we will definitely be back, love love love pure and whole i literally ate there at least twice in a month not tired at all of the menu which is wide and full of options or unexpected combination they dishes are all heaven the staff well sometimes are awake and sometimes not is china after all but the food conquer all dont miss to have the detox juice and the smoothies totally recommend and even to meat eaters go vegan, i mess with it i was in tha area for some lunch and i said i need some fruits and veggies i ate them joints real quick im in tha area for more bro expect me to come again, purewhole is my favorite in town for vegetarian and vegan food serves lunch and dinner all food and drinks freshly prepared from organic sources today went there for lunch and had our favorite dishes spring rolls spicy black bean paddies quinoa bowl and arabian wraps just delicious
highly recommend, a quick and refreshing lunch located on central shanghai the food was delicious highly recommend the black bean and the red pepper walnut dip the arabian wrap is wonderful as well i enjoyed the chai but the amount of leafy materials could be far less, wonderful vegan food creative dishes nice dining environment affordable i personally like the spring roll tofu cheese cake, this is for the shanghai centre location tripadvisor refuses to find this one excellent food a huge menu choice nice mix of chinese and western food styles good to see the calories listed with each choice makes it very easy to choose if youre watching your weight this location also did offer wine and beer everything looked really good it was the price youd expect to pay 2 starters 2 mains a beer and a ginger tea was around <u+00a5>240 staff were helpful and spoke good enough english great food we hope to visit china again i can only say please open a branch in wanaka nz, doesnt feel like your in shanghai with this escape through healthy food options just ate dinner here and it was delicious the menu choices are great the prices reasonable and the setting very modern and clean i highly rate this place to anyone looking for some good clean healthy food, needed a break from everything else and wanted something health found these guys on trip adviser and it was every bit as good as the reviews
great everything,  even so the menu is in chinese and english the waiters speak only chinese
 the restaurant is quite small in terms of available seats
 dessert choice is not wide

+ healthy and original menu proposed
+ the food served was good
+ juices proposed are original as well
+ restaurant settings is nice

=> i definitely recommend this restaurant for its healthy dishes and i will go back there with pleasure, we have been living in shanghai for two years but somehow never been to purewhole  big mistake this place offers satisfying tasty dishes with fresh flavors the ambience is simple but relaxing

that the food is vegetarian should be actually only a side line comment because this is essentially just good tasty and healthy food exactly what everyone needs during a standard shanghai weekday or weekend my husband loved the lentil burger, we stumbled upon this location around the corner from our office  and were we surprised at how incredible the offerings were lunchtime specials were diverse and so many options to choose from we struggle with finding good vegan food throughout asia and we have to say this is one of the best vegan restaurants we have found, ate for the first time today with a friend trying out their summer set menu the spring roll and arabian wrap were amazing and very filling the pumpkin soup and cleansing drink werent my favourite the soup especially was a bit diluted but were filling and complemented the main course well

overall one of the better vegetarian restaurants ive eaten in shanghai

one thing to note about this particular store  there is no washroom and the instructions given to find one were unclear 2nd floor of the starbucks which didnt have a 2nd floor, i found this place just by walking by on yanping road tthe picture of the daily special looked very good i was not disappointed i didnt realize it was a vegetarian restaurant until i read the menu

interesting drinks and menu choices this restaurant would do well in any western city, i could rave about pure and whole for probably too long from what ive gained this restaurant isnt only vegetarian but vegan the menu is novel length and full of delicious healthy plates that even myself as a plant based eater never imagined could be constructed so perfectly everything ive ordered thus far has been sublime their wraps are better than any ive ordered anywhere internationally and their quinoa balls with spiralized zucchini and cashew cheese is superb working in jingan there is a multitude of restaurants in the area but pure and whole is day after day the obvious choice if youre looking for clean healthy but most importantly delicious food pure and whole is a must im considering writing to them and encouraging them to open in europe, this is our 3rd visit and the food is exceptional note there are 4 locations of pure  whole but only 98 yanping road comes up other locations come up on the map but they still list as 98 yanping road as the address which is very confusing for people who dont know the city i hope they fix that so they wont lose customers we were very persistent and that got us here, i stayed near people square and struggled a lot to have pure vegetarian food i found this in ta and took metro it is very close yanping road metro station, if you are a vegetarian this place is heaven on earth although it is not a big deal to find veg food in shanghai i rarely find it tasty or healthy i believe pure and whole is the best vegetarian restaurant in the city you can see all the ingredients nutrients and even calories in the menu prices are a bit high but its totally worth it i want to mention that i went there with my nonvegetarian friend and she was greatly satisfied as well we werent even able to choose at the beginning because they have a lot of different dishes smoothies is a must try, nice setting when you are alone or two people then you can sit at the window bar the room with the tables is like a wooden cube
i had the spring rolls 3 for 23yuan thats ok the rolls itself are basically tasteless the sesame you can filter out a bit the sauce was almond milk soy honey spinach and sesame oil but actually i only tasted chilli which wasnt even mentioned less could be better for the sake of the other ingredients
then i had the quinoa patties 3 for 39yuan thats still ok but not more please the patties had a bit more taste the cumin helped i choose the kale guacamole a little bit avocado i could sense but the rest was i assume sitting around too long
so like many others i also think there is room left for more taste which could be achieved by doing some things fresh lemon just leaves after a while also garlic and many other herbs fresh grounding also makes a big difference
still i would come back and try one of the main dishes they sound good at least, so many healthy choices and they are delicious love the eggplant toast its a must try refreshing definitely great for summer spring roll is just ok i also love the pistachio paste pasta, this is wonderful place for meateaters like me i thought that this cannot be for me but when had my soup and burger i was ready to change my attitude about vege restaurants i will go again soon, healthy and testy vegan food very good menu for everyone good choice of detox soups and salads  portion size is good i love pure and whole, a great place to eat healthy and feel energized i love the smoothies the salads and the soups try the quinoa salad amazing great food great experience the service a little bit poor dont speak english very well but they will get the order eventually delicious the desserts as well made with organic ingredients the location is lovely, we are pure and whole addicted  only place in shanghai that serves such healthy and fresh food 2 menus per year pity there are too much garlic or peppers in some dishes manager is nice but pity staff does not speak a word of english could be developed in other countries would be worth it even in europe, great food but incredibly average service the atmosphere of the place feels a little like a place where someone who does a lot of exercise goes just to show off that they do a lot of exerciseand prices are adjusted for these sorts of people accordingly the food is good thank god but otherwise nothing that special which is a shame, we love to go to purewhole after a good workout for most of the dishes they propose small or large so you can adjust your portion according to your mood  good taste and lot of choice some dishes are quite expensive though i recommend the arabian wrap and the black beans pasties for starter the quinoa burger is awesome 
and if you want something tasty and surprising try the zucchini spaghetti cashew sauce 
fresh and clean atmosphere to feel good, i was very happy to find a plant based restaurant in shanghai as i move towards a meat free diet i was delighted when i was served very fresh beautifully prepared cuisine in an upbeat clean and stylish setting the staff spoke excellent english which is always a bonus for me the menu is extensive with a fun section for all their dips you can choose from i got the quinoa patties with the smokey sweet potato hummus and it was amazing very moist patties bursting with flavor and the hummus was off the hook i also had the awesome curry it had a nice kick to it and all the veggies were fresh and tasty it was more like a soup base compared to a thicker traditional curry but once i mixed in the rice it had a nice hearty stew feel to it topped off with a delicious raw apple cake which was fresh and tasted excellent they will definitely be seeing me again, i was very excited about this place but it turned into a big disappointment saladwhich suppose to be light and healthy was oily and very heavy dips eggplantcarrot are not tasty, what a delightful surprise
met up with friends for a dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambience with it simplistic loved the no clutter decor pure and whole offered its customers a clean lovely and peaceful place to share and enjoy a meal with friends
the menu selection is broad and treats its customers to basic nutritional value of what they are eating
it was such a wonderful feeling to walk away from dinner feeling refreshed and energized by the pure and whole food, great healthy food with lots of options its hard to find food outside of my kitchen that has the fresh whole ingredients that this restaurant uses, just used sherpas for the first time and i knew where i would be ordering from thanks to great things ive heard about pure  whole i ordered brown rice it was a little dryhard but thats coming from someone who normally soaks their rice for 24 hours the green goddess soup so so good and the detox salad i loveeed it my onlypersonal quip was that the dressing for the detox salad was already on the salad and it would have been nice to have it come on the side because it was a little soggy at the bottom but thats ok it was very sweet the brown rice was delicious and the goddess soup filled me up so refreshing as ive been living in a hotel for 5 weeks and have been craving things besides raw fruit + vegetable juices and plain white rice which are all common in shanghai thanks pure  whole, i really appreciate a place that has gluten free items and notifications on the menu their food is not only healthy but its delicious too

this place is my go to for ordering delivery through sherpa when im working late in the office one of the surest places that i can consistently get food from that i know will fit my dietary needs other than things i cook for myself, i came here a while ago with three of my friends  one vegan one pescatarian and the other like me omnivorous it was my first time at a veganvegetarian restaurant and it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be it was actually pretty okay i forgot what i ordered but it was a salad with quinoa the ingredients looked great and it had a variety of interesting healthy foods but together it lacked overall taste the components individually great but together missing something my vegan friend ordered a wrap of some sort and an ice tea and she said it was delicious as always my other friend ordered a curry noodle dish which looked not that good in the picture but tasted probably the best out of all the dishes ordered
dessert was probably the most interesting we ordered the tofu cheesecake ecstasy balls and something else cant seem to remember it right now the tofu cheesecake was surprisingly good and didnt taste too tofuy at all the ecstasy balls were built up too much by the menu and it wasnt as great as wed expected it to be
i would say this is a good restaurant for omnivores like me to dip a toe into the vegetarian lifestyle but i dont think ill come back alone for vegansvegetarians this place should satisfy fit your eating needs, pure and whole is a super initiative towards better but tasty eating i love their matchstick pasta salads can be better they use a lot of healthy ingredients like quinoapumpkin tofu in their recipes, i keep coming back on trips to shanghai and this place never fails to deliver excellent food great service and a place to chill also serve good coffee and as odd as it might sound to non vegans the tofu cheesecake is devine, went to the one in shanghai archway at hongqiao maotai road the cashew breakfast cookie was delicious wanted to have lunch but it starts only at 1130am will definitely come by next time to try, this was the only healthy option still open at 830pm

my usual takeout places for working overtime are wagas or baker  spice this is my first time trying pure  whole and it seems that the quality is better as well as variety very fresh tasting and i feel like the ingredients used are better

pricing is only a bit higher than wagas and baker  spice but portion is so so small maybe about only 70 of the other places, had the indian lentil cauliflower stew <u+00a5>52 and it was tasty portion is not a lot but enough to fill you if you are a small eater
clean environment and not crowded when i was at kerry parkside outlet at 6pm
price on the upper average but the promise of wholesome meal makes it worthwhile, tried the arabian wrap and the awesome curry through sherpa i had a good idea of ordering two dishes as the wraps are baby sized especially compared to wagas it is not filling the curry was a salt bomb i suspect a mistake but i had to drink a lot of water to survive it rice was nice a bit afraid of ordering again, we were very pleased with our wonderful saladssoupscurry and wraps so good we ordered take away for dinner the kale salad was spectacular very high standards and you should be pleasantly surprised well done to the owners will be back on next visit in this very tastefully designed restaurant very clean and excellent service not the type of restaurant easy to find in china, as im a strict vegetarian i ordered food from this restaurant through sherpa since it is listed as a vegan place i ordered the arabian wrap which was decent along with a falafel this was a filler item and green curry with rice

the food was below average at best the falafel was tasteless the greens with the falafel old and going brown the green curry with rice was below average leaving a bad taste in the mouth, cant get enough of this place love the choice and the protein carb breakdown for each dish if only more places could do this my absolute favorite shanghai eatery to date try the chilli  its devine, had a relaxing mostly delicious lunch here with a friend yesterday trying quite a lot of dishes as my friend was so hungry and ordered everything in sight

its a little pricey but i think thats justified given the quality of the ingredients and use of some more unusual items that must cost more to source generally we were very satisfied and i would certainly go there again

the good
 everything was extremely fresh

 some very creative combinations i especially recommend the matchstick pasta with an amazingly rich pistachio puree and asparagus  probably best shared as it is so very rich the salad with lentil patties great variety of salad leaves and the addition of pumpkin and beetroot cubes add sweetness without needing an unhealthy dressing and the broccoli dip pepped up with chilli

 nice outdoor seating area free of smokers at least on our visit

the bad

 the unpleasant soup immunity soup cant remember the name but its the one on the same page as the green goddess soup on the menu  a kind of broth with greens mushroom pieces radish carrot and tofu elsewhere the menu boasts about how they dont use fryers and how healthy everything is  and then they unnecessarily add a load of oil to this soup it adds little to the flavour which is still pretty bland apart from the bitterness of the greens  they could have added more ginger or another spice to pep it up instead and left a greasy slick on my tongue we left most of it very disappointing that the item that appeared the healthiest on the menu from the name was actually the least healthy thing we ordered

 the service the waiters were nice enough but we often had to call a couple of times to get someone to take our order bring the bill even though there were a couple of them just standing around worse was that this restaurant which can produce innovative combinations of flavours in more complex dishes is apparently incapable of providing a glass of hot water my friend and i made a point of ordering hot water not tepid she is chinese and we ordered in mandarin so the problem was not a language one but their first attempt was still tepid when i politely repeated my desire for boiling water they eventually replaced it with a glass of slightly hotter water i gave up at this point and just drank my almosttepid water

the most basic holeinthewall restaurant can manage boiling water so service like this is really not acceptable when you are spending over 100rmb per person, food and drinks are new healthy concept in shanghai great atmosphere while the lunch was full house frank is a good guy whos really helpful and looking after his guest i definitely recommend this place and they do take away service for their neighbors, this place is great and the menu is a nice variety of wraps soups salad etc typical midrange westernish vegetarian food no complaints but the way people talk about this and place it should change your life it was good and id go back just dont expect your mind to be blown, a nice take away package for me if i do have a lot of office job and couldnt take time to go out for lunch the vegetarian burger was diet and nicely portioned fresh juices that i can choose whatever the vegetables or fruits staffs are friendly and helpful
the place also has a simple yet but fresh design that makes me feel home, tracked down the portman location  it hides next to starbucks in the far left corner as you face the hotel from the road and was not disappointed huge selection of mouthwatering temptations hard to decide what to have and such a pleasure when most places have only one or two dishes i can eat a bit pricey but well worth it from an ethical as well as purely taste point of view healthy wholesome no great service please open a restaurant in nanjing also a very decent espresso, if like me youre a vegetarian and youve been in asia a while you will love this place you might possibly be overwhelmed with all the choice the food is a high standard and most prices are very reasonable the burgers are my favourite and a dip platter is a must so much wholesome healthy and vegetarian stuff to choose from definitely worth a look if you are veggie and even if youre not my meateater bf also loves this place, the location of p and w is quite convenient for us but we thought that the food was merely average","steakhouse",0.928564564719539
76,"food was very good staff very attentive and polite good quality food we have two starters two mains no drinks for the equivalent of about <u+00a3>40 i would recommend booking we were very lucky to walk in off the street without a booking and get a table people after us were not so lucky, this place was already nice but they remodeled recently so we went back to try

previously the childrens play room was quite worn out with nothing fun for kids to do

post renovation i honestly dont see much difference in the restaurant it was already nice looking so im not sure what changed
the childrens play room however it is much better than before

the food is still fantastic its a great place to eat especially when youre bringing kids because they can play on the weekends they have somebody to watch the kids for you while you eat so you dont have to deal with the hassle of them wanting to play while you want to eat

great idea good food nice place

must try the lamb with hummus really good and ive never been a fan of hummus, group of 20 colleagues went out for a dinner we had a variety of starters humus olive leaves main course of lamb was to die service was excellent we wanted for nothing  raki was green but not to be trifled with would definitely recommend it as the genuine turkish delight, was there with 2 friends and everything about it was great
service was good as waiters were very attentive
food was amazing and we made sure to order food cooked for hoursdays havent had any sort of meat softer

they ran out of a specific turkish wine which was initially recommended but the replacement wine was really impressive

i will definitely visit again during my next shanghai trip, im definitely not up on this type of food however i know what i like garlic offered and great menu with many dishes i wanted to try immediately the wine list was good but they were out of stock in many areas service was excellent but since we were the only guests at the time its hard to honestly rate the food was spectacular and very well presented overall well worth a visit but remember to make a reservation especially dining after 7pm, garlic is one of old favorites for a nice filling mediterranean meal wood fire oven makes delicious pide and their warm hummus with lamb and muhamarra are always top notch the only downside would be the removal of turkish wine from by the glass list and quite high prices its a treat rather than casual dining establishment, the interior design is beautifully decorated has a considerable space between the tables the design of the plates tumblers and wine glasses is just perfect food is delicious they even have a small selection veggie friendly the disappointed part is the service we were 3 couples and order the starters and main togethers and specify to the floor manager pls bring first the starters and later the main courses they did whatever they want it was like a sandwich starter main course starter main course starter starter main course main course and the waiter didnt care that the table look like a good jenga trying to squeeze all the plates it was a pitty the whole food experience was just ruined we call the floor manager because he was the one that took our order and explain him how unpleasant it was to bring all dishes at the same time he was like ok will you going to order desert outrageous nice food but im not coming back, all foods in restaurant are same as in turkish restaurants in turkey but believe me you can find more delicious foods in garlic portions are like double prices are little high but ambiance is excellent, the location is not that bad exterior  interior design looks great all the arrangements looks great  well decorated the food on the other hand is freaking delicious taste awesome and looks really pretty fine dining, very nice restaurant recently refurbished we appreciated a lot the food the excellent humus served with grilled lamb the most delicious falafel we have ever eaten the juicy garlic hamburger and the good lamp chops the dishes are generous and the bill is in line with the excellent food and the precious location the staff can speak a perfect english and they are very kind we warmly suggest to go to garlic and enjoy their food, good service food is meat heavy on the mains as with other turkish cuisines so i would balance it with a few vegetarian starters nice location currently under renovation so hoping itll reopen soon even have a kids corner in the basement, food was excellent and the ambience wonderful a little difficult to find the restaurant but well worth it i would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who enjoys real turkish food, maybe the best turkish restaurant in town i really enjoyed the atmosphere and the good was great good service too high class turkish, first turkish restaurant i tried it was a success location not so easy for the taxi driver but i think it was more due to the driver the food is very good one chinese waitress soso the other one very good i discovered turkish food excellent quantity correct fresh ingredients, this place is around the corner from my apartment everything they make is fantastic and well presented their staff are generally great the lamb dishes are amazing i cant say enough good things about the food here the interior is very classy and well appointed this is a cant miss restaurant in the french concession, first of all a not to chinese restaurateurs if you have air conditioning and a door keep it closed in the summer the ac will work better and it keeps the flies out i have been in several spots this trip hot humid weather outside ac blasting doors and windows open and flies buzzing
there were many wonderful things about garlic the homemade yogurt garlic and mint appetizer was rich cool and flavorful they have wonderful flat bread served right out of the oven and puffed up like a party balloon and crusted with toasted sesame seed black and white it was delicious the flat bread with ground lamb was pretty good too the chestnut rice served with the main course was unusual and delicious as well the room was beautifully set and the table settings were lovely
unfortunately the my entree billed as the �best lamb you�ve ever tasted� was to put it bluntly not basically this dish called pilavli kuzu kaburga is barbequed lamb since i come from north carolina one of the many homes of barbeque i feel qualified to comment on garlic�s preparation the challenge of getting a meat pork or lamb not normally heavily marbleized with fat like beef barbequed so its eatable is to make sure bits of fat are incorporated into the chop or preparation somehow or another, as a birthday treat for my turkish wife i took her to garlic for a lunch with the kids after it was highly recommended by colleagues
unfortunately we were the only diners in the whole restaurant so obviously lacked an atmosphere my wife ordered all the food and we were not let down the kids had the manti and we ordered a variety of dishes patrician salatasi roasted eggplant pure gavuragi salatasi cucumber tomato walnut salad lahmacun mucver zucchini pancakes and my personal favorite and the hunker begendi lamb and eggplant finished off with turkish coffee and cikolate sufle
as it was my wifes birthday the owner emre had arranged a bouquet of roses for my wife which was a wonderful gesture that ive never come across before
we had hoped to enjoy our lunch in relative peace from the kids since i had been told there was a playroom downstairs but it was closed and being used for storage the restaurant probably needs some urgent renovation since the walls were in bad shape with damp and mould the bill was reasonable considering we had three courses and a bottle of very nice turkish wine sauvignon blanc
overall it was an enjoyable outing and will definitely go again most probably for dinner next time in the hope we will not be dining alone, a lovely restaurant with great food and a real buzz superb authentic turkish food and excellent service we were looked after by nedim who was welcoming and attentive and helped with our food and wine choices we will definitely be going back, wow this was a great night deliciously authentic food and excellent service set the tone in this family owned and operated restaurant i believe that this rivals most restaurants ive eaten at in istanbul and bursa at a great price in downtown shanghai we will definitely be back here with our team this is a perfect spot for a large group of business associates to enjoy, this restaurant was selected for us and we not disappointed the food was outstanding i wish i could remember what was ordered everything was fresh and tasty we had 8 children with us also and they were will taken care of by the staff the spices used were wonderful a bustling restaurant with happy dinners would definitely recommend you go and enjoy, dined her with friends and had a nice meal the decor and atmosphere was modernfresh and the setting was very comfortable staff was very attentive hospitable genuine and kind we had a lamb dish signature and thought it was perfect ice cream was below average compared to what you get in istanbul i would come back again and would classify it as highly recommended, good authentic turkish restaurant confirmed by my turkish colleague food environement and service was good the waiter gave me a good recommendation of what to order the menu has good selection but not too much do try the appetizers most of the menu contain lambgoat so some people may not too keen about that but do have selection of seafood chicken and beef as well i took my wife and kids during my wife birthday and she loved it, i been there on saturday  for lunch  we order  lahmacun  mixed pita and mixed grill  for the lahmacun the meat on it was too blend and have a strange smell  the mixed pida was average as well  they put mushrooms on it  slices of meat and cheese  it was ok  the mess is the mix bbq  3 lamb chops  all fat   3 chicken legs  and 3 kofta  the kofta was taste as a muffin  too soft because i think they put a lot of bread on it i didnt taste the meat at all  was very disappointing  we didnt finish it  meat are not proper marinated not well spiced  will not come back, i have been to garlic many times and am always happy and stuffed when i leave unlike many middle eastern restaurants in town they branch out beyond kebabs and pide to deliver an authentic highend turkish experience including some dishes that are hard to find outside of turkey

for a real treat order the kunefe which is a honeysoaked dessert stuffed with semisweet cheese and baked ezme salad kushbashi pide like a pizza ichli kofte breaded spiced meatballs and tiny turkish dumplings in youghurt manti are all worth getting

service is very attentive as well atmosphere is fancy but personal, it was good to drink raki in china you can eat outside also while smoking the taste was smiliar like in turkey i will going to visit there again, love love love this food ive been to turkey and love turkish food im not going to say this is exactly the same but come on youre not in istanbul the salad is absolutely fantastic the bbq platter is absolutely awesome the mixed pida is rich and filled well with toppings

they have a small play room downstairs which worn out broken kids toys but its more than you can say for most places

ive already been here twice love this place and will eat here again

nice chocolate souffle also, i have visited this turkish restaurant in a quaint neighbourhood of xu hui district in shanghai about 4 times for both lunch and dinner i found the service friendly and efficient and food very good i took my family to dinner tonight for 730pm booking and surprised the place was packed with people waiting for tables the manager politely apologised and our table was ready within 10 mins we started with chopped tomatoes and cucumber with mint leaves and walnuts in lemon juice zucchini pancakes and prawnshrimps actually in mozzarella cheese in iron pot with signature grilled chicken legs and prime lamb chops as main courses while waiting one of the manager suggested a before dinner drink he suggested raki made from grape a liquor similar to pastis when the grilled dishes arrived i was greatly disappointed that they were lukewarm i informed the manager who offered to replace with new orders which i declinedwaste not later one of the staff informed me that the orders had been deleted meanwhile i met the manager nedem i asked for a bottle of raki to go he asked me which typethere are 3 grades i asked for the standard one nedem gave me a premium one at a discounted price dont forget to ask for nedem next time you visit garlic in shanghai dec 3rd 2015, overall a great atmosphere service and food my special applause goes for muhammara which is a turkish finger food, if you are expert in turkish cusine dont go there it is not like the turkish restaurant in istanbul but if you jest like the turkish food  go there and will enjoy it the prices are not reasonable but expensive, we went early on a thursday evening and were immediately seated service was polite and attentive in both english and chinese staff were happy to recommend dishes and our water was regularly topped up which is not always the case in shanghai restaurants the waitstaff took careful note of my severe peanut allergy and doublechecked with the kitchen reassuring

we ordered meze muhammara salad and flatbread followed by lamb the bread was fresh out of the oven piping hot and served with several flavoursome dips by the time the lamb marinated in milk rolled around we were stuffed garlic is pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion, got a delivery from this place using sherpas delivery service food was great fresh tasty goat cheese arugala salad portion was a little on the small side i ordered some hummus and it was supposed to come with pita but they forgot it ruined my meal completey so i will not be ordering from this place again, the food is absolutely delicious and the tastes are very authentic the service is excellent the best turkish food in shanghai, this place is fabulous love the salads and the lamb perhaps one of the best lamb cuts i have ever had in my life cooked to perfection i believe it is soakedmarinated in milk and spices for a day or more and then executed to plate effective presentation stellar service responsive to table needs and quick to correct any minor deviation from the dinning experience i cant wait to come back here again the best part is that i live right around the block from here, found by chance one evening food was fabulous good service very clean very welcoming of children lovely menu highly recommend the zucchini pancakes  huge hit with kids and adults if ever back in shanghai will def be returning to garlic, great tasting food reminded me of my recent trip to istanbul the meat they use is good quality and they give you large portions except the soup which tastes great but is too small for the price

i love the kebabs lentil soup vegetables salad all fresh and delicious good place, if you are staying in shanghai or visiting do drop by this restaurant and try their turkish food nice atmosphere and service too do not over order as some of the portion is big and good for two person, the food is quiet good but try to make a reservation is impossible we have been trying for the past 2 weekends to make a reservation and no one will pick up the phone last weekend we finally got through after trying for a long time the service was equally bad as trying to get someone to answer the phone there were only 2 other tables that was occupied it took them a good 20 minutes before someone came by with the menus and water we did enjoy the meal and departed with our tummies full within 5 minutes my phone rings and its the manager from garlic wanting to know if we were trying to call them to make a reservation if you have the time and dont mind waiting  this place has good food, great dining in shanghai with friends the food was very good some of the best turkish food i have had we sampled a salad a pide  flatbread with 3 cheeses zucchini pancakes stuffed eggplant and a lamb dish the mojitos are very tasty also a good choice in shanghai, food in general was tasty and fine we told our our server that we would like to have the hot dished to be served when the cold finishes but still have been served immediately sent back the hot but not sure the have cooked new one as the dough was dry then they kept pushing us to order the dessert around 930pm which means they all ready to go home
its not worth the money if youre expecting a stunning dinner, i am giving this place five stars because i really cant fault the food the service the atmosphere the only problem is the price you are getting a high standard of food and that is worth paying extra for but a bottle of beer is still a bottle of beer and shouldnt necessarily be doubled tripled in price be prepared to spend at least 400500rmb 4050<u+00a3> for two people here and one of us wasnt even drinking i would recommend this place if you have cash to spare or for a special occasion, this is a turkish restaurant which is located near the hotel that i stayed  twelve at hengshan  which is a 5 mins walk away not sure why its called garlic but probably all their food contains garlic even the condiment have garlic on it the portion is a bit small but they do not compromise on their taste all the lambs and muttons are very well blend with the spices and they are very tasty probably i came on an empty stomach so thats why even the bread tasted great nice ambience and decor attentive service only the price is a bit expensive they are only open for dinner, i really like this restaurant authentic turkish food and ambient that make you feel you are in istanbul for a while mediterranean flavours in any case
delicious specially dont miiss the mixed grill for 3 persons that is my favorite
for families with children there is a nice playground in the basement that is another plus, after trying a couple of time to get a table we finally got one on a friday night the restaurant was very busy the service was attentive and the food arrived after a little wait
lots of small dishes that can easily be share by a couple which is great and lets you try some more tastes, even though the service seems a little selective and dump the food is extraordinary and brings you very special experience the environment is warm and cozy gemutlich with upper level appearance in the basement theres a playground for kids, went here last night with 6 of my friends and tried their spicy beef tenderloin for starters succulent meat and very tender but nothing compared to their best lamb dish youve ever tasted thats seriously the name of the dish to start with im not a big fan of lamb because of the aftertaste but i was really curious about this one which was why i decided to try it for me it really delivered on its promise  not only because its one of the very few lamb dishes ive ever tried but because this 6hour slow cooked lamb tasted really good the rice with chestnuts was a good accompaniment to the lamb we also ordered the garlic platter which had an assortment of meats on it and everything was very delicious then we had a sort of lamb and beef roll  sorta looks like an enchilada with yogurt sauce  which was very very yummy last but not least we ordered a chocolate shuffle not a souffle per se but something that looks like it and kanafe for dessert both were good but i personally prefer the kanafe jn efes as its cheesier

we ended up spending around rmb300 each mostly due to the 4 bottles of wine that we had but the food in general is reasonably priced ranging from rmb60200 per dish and everything was good for sharing this is a good place to have dinner with friends and just eat away all the stress in the world, the restaurant interieur is cosy or you can call it even romantic
when crowded it has a tendency yo be quite noisy inside
food is very well prepared an the tastes are very authentic turkish with a cross over asian tendency it is a not more in the pricey side but the food quality and the cosy environment is a great experience and therefor still ok value for money however the competition with other very good turkish restaurants in shanghai is getting very tough and the garlic team needs to improve the service a little it is not as warmhearted as in the beginning and they tend to be slightly arrogant maybe enough customers 
but this is just my personal impression and others might see this differently
still a very good place to go and i am happy to tell my friends
good to know is also that kids are allowed and no issue if they are a bit noisy, not what i expected the service a really disaster in the restaurant there were just 56 tables no more than 20 people when we ordered we asked twice to have the apetizers before and the main course afternothing to dothey brought us all togheter and the main course was cold
when we finished more or less 2150 i asked the menu for the dessert but the kitchen was already closed and nobody told us
id like to underline thats not a cheap restaurant at all and if i pay that much i claim good food good service and the dessert
being a western restaurant it could be also very nice to have someone who speaks or at least understand english, we visited garlic for sunday lunch and it wasnt as crowded as i was expecting it is an upscale restaurant so the atmosphere is very cosy it is kind of child friendly with a playground downstairs however i only say kind of as the baby changing room is just a wooden table not really made to change diapers but anyway the major asset of this restaurant is the quality of the food which for us from starters to deserts was just delicious i decided to treat myself with their best lamb in town dish treat as in rmb 180 the dish but it was so worth it i was not too familiar with turkish cuisine before but garlic makes me want to explore more i just tasted so fresh
i may also add that they offer complimentary mineral water which is the first time i see that in 6 years in china and this ought to be mentioned as i felt that was a very nice touched

treat yourself and experience modern turkish food, we visited garlic at around 3pm on a saturday and there were only a few people there it is kid friendly with a playroom downstairs the restaurant is expensive but worth it we ordered the meat platter an assorted dish with chicken and lamp chops potatoes broccoli and garlics signature lamb dish which takes them 6 hours to cook but they cook it before you arrive this costed a huge 380rmb but it is a giant dish so it could fill the entire family, the hummus the lamb the bread i dream about this place  thankfully i live just around the corner garlic is great for big groups of friends  its better that way because you can order more food to share the atmosphere is gorgeous and upscale  but at the same time very family friendly downstairs there is a large banquet roomchildrens room where you see kids watching cartoons and running around upstairs their parents are enjoying wine and the delicious food love it one of the best places in shanghai  and i eat at a lot of places ","dumpling restaurant",0.55256006938231
77,"really nice escargot and tuna crusty bread with garlic herb butter many seafood entrees had the halibut and scallops  both good lemon cake for dessert had many flavors of lemon cake icing frosting ice cream, my daughter specially book this restaurant for us she said that we must try this french restaurant she have also arranged jason oakley the chef to cook for us her description of jasons food absolutely blew their mind when she and her husband dined last year she have also arranged to pay for the whole bill
when we landed to shanghai he headed for the dinner at coquille when they opened at 530pm
jason was so kind to greet us and to recommend his signature dishes starting from starter main dish and dessert angeline have half dozen of oysters 4 from france one from iceland and 1 from usa jason told us the oyster from flow in from a special selected oyster farms i have beef tartar which is so delicious the highlight is the wellington beef with mushroom and duck liver baked with a crusty bread it really melt in the mouth we wish we could eat more but willing to sample a little of madeleine kind of butter freshly oven baked cookies we have an lovely evening and dinning in one of the best french restaurant so happy to meet john liu the friendly owner of the restaurant highly recommend, living in shanghai and this was one of the best western meals ive had nice decor gives the feel of a french bistro and very welcoming and attentive service adds to the atmosphere food was excellent everything was really well executed and delicious we had the crab profiteroles beef tartar excellent black cod and short ribs highly recommend will definitely be coming back again, owner john liu has put together a great venue with a great team met the owner while we were dining chef oakley came by our table as well as to other tables to make sure our menu choices were exactly what we wanted and described how he would prepare them the somm vincent recommended three different wines by the glass during the meal all of which went perfectly with the menu staff is very attentive location and decor french casual bistro make a great atmosphere, we had a great dinner here while visiting shanghai there were so many small bites on the menu that we opted for 8 small plates through the evening rather than getting any mains although i am sure that they were also wonderful definitely try the uni toast the flavors were incredible and inventive
i love the vibe in the restaurant and i love the decorative taste it was so fun being in there on a friday night even if it was not so hectic due to the end of the national holiday week the gin cocktails are really delicious so if you are a fan i definitely suggest you get one the mixologist there was very special
the only problem we had was that they had trouble with the american express reader and were weird about communicating it with us they accepted visamaster card and i made the reservation through amex platinum so had i just brought my amex cards we would have been cleaning dishes or in the hands of chinese law  only kidding but they handled it a little oddly than we are used to in the states overall a cute restaurant with wonderful food and drinks highly recommend, we started with a drink in the bar very nice drinks served in unusual glassescups all the food was presented in an tasty  delicious way we thought we had ordered the best from the menu different seafood beef fish and foie gras but looking at our neighbours tablefood we will have to come back and try some more dishes all the food we were served were delicious and tasty a bit expensive but worth it, i have been a few times now and its time to share first off the food was amazing but lets start with the service we felt very welcomed and welcomed back by the whole staff they helped with the menu and explained what every dish was once it was served great cocktails and wine list to top it off have made for some great meals in coquille jason the chef comes out and personalizes the 5 star service talking about the food that doesnt need much talking about because it is damn good starters to desserts were amazing and cant find anything on the menu i dont like we will be back very soon, if you want michelin star quality without pretentious bs then this is your place attentive personalized service and easy accessibility to the chef without being stuffy and uncomfortable the chef and staff will make sure you are looked after and understand what youre getting without making a fuss love the seafood but the starters and the beef wellington limited availability are totally worth the trip for even a casual night out but also make for a hell of a special occasion absolutely incredible and a favorite of visiting celebs occasionally too, located a bit away form the usual restaurant strips this place is worth the extra walk

seafood presented in a array of tasty sauce and accompaniments that leave you taste buds buzzing  good range of dishes on the menu so always something fro those who might not want to over indulge in seafood

service was excellent and good range of wines on the wine list, beef wellington only used to be available on wednesdays  now it is available any day if you give three days notice

it comes with mashed potato and asparagus ideally id suggest sharing it between 3

wonderful staff and acceptable prices make this an excellent destination, we have been there twice with my wife and we really enjoy it the seafood is fantastic and also the service unfortunately the location is not one of the best in shanghai and the environment is cold it will be worth for the owner to change the internal design to create a more warm environment im sure they will increase the business, last friday we had a family dinner at coquille second time i went since their opening chef jason oakley prepare an amazing modern french cuisine and the french manager vincent gave us really good attention great environment service and food definitely one of my favorite fine dining in shanghai with a reasonable price for this quality we will go back for sure to discover their new menu coming soon, all the dishes we had were very good especially the grilled cod fish accompanied by an excellent morgon wine from foillard 2 bottles  and amazing service
simply excellent , i dined here about a month ago with my husband and his colleagues i was impressed a fine dining in china very traditional with personalized service from the manager and staff coming from a hospitality background and having been worked in a french fine dining long ago i was impress to see people still enjoy such dining experience with so much attention staff were very knowledgable and well aware of the wine  food selection the manager was very friendly and made our dining experience amazing restaurant was full as it was also a saturday night but we still had the attention and service as im a vegetarian the chef was kind to prepare me a risotto which was simply amazing he even came out to meet and say hi to his customers one would think the chef is from france and i was only more impress to be told he was from the states definitely an amazing dinner with each dish prepared with so much passion and attention to detail desserts are definitely a must try as they are very traditional especially the chocolate fondue  cream brulee i would suggest making reservations as they have limited seats  are only open for dinner i would definitely give this restaurant a 5 star  would indeed come back, although the place is already renowned as one of the best seafood restaurants in shanghai with excellent and creative dishes on a daily basis i strongly recommend to try the wellington beef on wednesdays on reservation only chef jason oakley decided to revisit this old traditional bourgeois recipe  so old that no one really remembers how it tastes and how should it be prepared  and the result is simply a masterpiece  which certainly took hours of work before it comes on your table a perfect wine pairing proposed by vincent  the man in charge in the room  a faugeres 2011 in that case excellent service and of course good company made one of the best dinners i had in a long time a must try absolutely for any one looking for a good combination of atmosphere service kindness and gastronomy, first time was two years ago amazed by the crab although girl and me was trying to be elegant but the crab made us failed  then i cannot keep my hands off this place
wednesdays beef wellington and thursdays happy hour are my favorite days i live in shanghai this place is always on my top recommending list to friends who are looking for fine dinning choices, i went there with my girlfriend for dinner on a busy night and have been impressed with both excellent food and service great ingredients prepared with technique and passion that�s exactly what we got from a super pleasing wagyu short rib to a beautiful chocolate finish the warm homemade madelaine offered at the end of the dinner were definitely a delicate attention too we will come back, i have passed in front of the restaurant many times but never imagined that the quality of the food inside would be that good it seems coquille has been around for awhile but i only noticed it after chef jason oakley took over in 2015 i cant compare with how it was run before but can attest to the quality of the food now similar to an earlier review i left the chef take over and i am very glad i did the appetizers consisted of scargot scallops tete de cochon and a mean steak tartar as good as the steak tartar was it was overshadowed by the greatest beef wellington i ever tasted perfectly cooked with a crust of foie gras that enhanced the flavor of the crust

wine was good but expensive very common in shanghai unfortunately

i will certainly be coming back to try other dishes i was impressed by the overall quality of the ingredients and level of service a gem of a restaurant in busy shanghai not cheap but worth the money, i went there after the recommendation from a friend and i am happy i did the location is a bit unusual for a restaurant of this standard but its very near xintiandi the decor and atmosphere reminds of a vintage french bistro and has a very cozy feeling the service was very warm and friendly which is not easy to come by in shanghai the food was excellent with a focus on classic french cuisine with a little asian touch loved the rabbit rolls and the beef tartare
great discovery, coquille is a nice sized restaurant with terrific food well made and fresh and with great service to boot the food is innovative consistently delicious and in one word amazing i go back to this restaurant on business trips because of the food service combination that is great to bring friends and business clients to and eat and build good relations i can truly say you will not be disappointed if you go, we went with friends the chef came to our table to suggest to let him choose the dishes what a great choice he cooked fantastic various seafood dishes and an amazing beef wellington the wine list is on the pricey side but some great producers on there will definitely come back well done to the chef jason , great we went for their new years eve set menu and were not disappointed every course was beautifully presented and delicious the beef tartar canape was stunning and the seafood platter was a huge hit my favorite was the foie gras ravioli i have also been there for a normal menu night and it was wonderful highly recommend the beef wellington wednesday, this place surprised us with amazing food we had raw oysters roasted duck consomme foie gras a la creme brulee vinegarette scallops cod fish halibut black pepper crab spaghetti and chocolate sherbet

the foie gras a la creme brulee was amazing im not a fan of foie gras but perfect marraige between sweet and savory was out of this world the seafood was fresh and well cookedi was pleasantly surprised by the chocolate sherbet how could chocolate survive without milk yes it can, i would say this is the best italian restaurant in shanghai foods is excellent the only downside is somewhat expensive, coquille is a very nice upscale seafood restaurant weve been there several times and never been disappointed the surprise of the menu is the weekly beef wellington served on wednesday evenings while the place is known for its seafood the beef wellington is definitely worth a try however you need to book this the day before, decor

nice recreation of an old style french bistro down to black  white tiles on the floor nice interior clean bathrooms which is always a plus in china fortunately tables are placed a bit more apart than regular french bistro so private conversation can easily be carried out

location

excellent location  right next to metro station upstairs dining is insulated form street noise with a cleverly enclosed mezzanine like set up but offers limited views in general not much to look at anyway

food

quite good but would not go entirely gaga about it you paying for it quite well if not a tad too much

drinks

big selection at outrageous prices the lowest prices bottle of wine is in mid rmb 300s just because guests want to have a wine a single bottle does not need to be priced like a sixpack of very good bordeaux from yhd website this part of menu is quite unreasonable i understand that mainly chinese clientele has mostly no clue about wines and buys them based on price to impress their guests but still cmon have some decency there are many great choices that can be offered for rmb 100 less without giving impression of a lower quality of establishment

ambiance

a bit too bright lighting does serve well for a business type of entertainment but not really for a romantic evening no dress code so you will find in summer people coming dressed in tshirts shorts and flipflops for an evening dinner crowd that one would more expect at the sandwich joint

service

excellent and very helpful but a bit too eager to pour wine into your glass even if there is still an inch left in the glass ordered items come swiftly once previous plate is finished and cleaned very measured and nonrushing

overall

good experience but  location location location if you want a romantic evening you may be tempted to look elsewhere, last night was my 6th visit to this restaurant and i have never been disappointed the service is of a good western standard the menu is excellent with interesting touches to standard dishes there is a good wine list and they dont assassinate you with the prices like many western restaurants in shanghai well worth a visit, i invited a number of business acquaintances for a dinner and it was great we had a quiet table upstairs the service was great and the food was fantastic the beef wellington is one of the best ive had and the frios gras creme brulee is not an intuitive dish but wonderful, we went for the first time tonight and thought that the place is a perfect french bistro in shanghai food was perfectly prepared tried various appetizers mains and sides ambiance was very pleasant and the service was highly professional we will definitely be back, this was an elegant and sophisticated french dining experience the food was excellent beautifully fresh ingredients and presented excellently the raw seafood bar is well stocked and presented if you like oysters etc definitely worth a visit if you want some great seafood, went here for an anniversary was blown away by the service absolutely every need was taken care of even my vegetarian request was met dinner was rounded out with a complementary chocolate tart excellent all around, very nice and warm atmosphere great menu good wine perfect service especially manager reijnaldo

the food was very tasty well executed

but you have to pay the price not cheap reasonable, i have eaten at coquille several times and each time i have really enjoyed the food especially the oysters and the wine and the atmosphere
it is not cheap there are plenty of places in shanghai that are so go to them if that is what you are looking for  otherwise please enjoy the meal so many things to try bon appetit, a cozy place which serving modern styled seafood and french food ordered an onion soup a salad a beef bavette and two side dishes the portion is good enough for two of us and in general they are tasty service was very good and the manager shawn was really helpful and provided good service
coquile is a good restaurant for a laid back family dinner an certainly we will be back for another occasion, john liu does a fine job on all aspects if this seafood focused bistro his wait staff are attentive and prompt and all with more international dining standards in presentation and timing of service

do go and enjoy the decor and layout the raw bar is fantastically presented and fresh the menu looks both sophisticated yet approachable

this time around we went only small plates dont overlook the simple green salad escargot topped with asian curry also their coquille execution is perfect showing off the quality of mussels

surprises were the crab roe pasta great staple to add to a seafood evening

will be a new favorite and hope the quality keeps consistent, this is a very good place to go if you want to eat very fresh oysters and other seafood nice selection of oysters from france normandie charente newzealand and japan
i must add they are perfectly opened with no pieces of shell coming into your mouth
place is noisy but decoration is nice and typically french
prices are little high to go there too frequently , we had the last 5 years in shanghai every year a christmas eve set menue with matching wines but what we eat this year in the coquille  well that was michelin star level  just outstanding thanks for that super nice food and evening, coquille is owned and managed byjohn liu who also manages the excellent italian restaurant scarpetta next door

the first impression you have of coquille is clean and intimate the white and black tile patterns and the mosaic floors really reminded me of several excellent french bistros there is a great seafood bar featuring the days oysters small bar seating but very nice bistro style seating in the restaurant proper

the food is superb the oysters we tried three varieties were among the best we have had in shanghai along with capo enzo carbones italian restaurant all three we tried were freshly in from france and were perfect they also specialize in a several different tartare dishes we had the nz venizon excellent one of our friends had the french onion soup since it is a dish he tries in every serious french restaurant he visits and pronounced this one 810  coming from him very high praise

two of us shared a large pork chop that was among the best pieces of pork i have had in shanghai perfectly cooked and seasons very high quality bistro food two other guests had a true cod dish that slightly disappointed  perhaps too many flavors vying for attention

the wine list is well chosen and priced by christoffer who also manages the list at scarpetta the list matches and food and ambience of coquille perfectlly definitely on the list of go to restaurants in shanghai","Jazz bar",0.999808152964461
78,"i was there for lunch with my family we were around 5 tables at the terrace and 2 tables inside we had to call the waiter different ones about 56 times to take note there is a menu where you can choose starter and main or main and dessert also 3 course menu is available we chose 2 course menu it was very difficult to explain to the waiter she could not understand even though we just chose what it was on the menu no changes
nevertheless the food was nice we try the ceviche to much lime for me truffle risotto cuban chicken pasta with prawn
for desserts tiramisu which was soso avoid the house wine
the area in the terrace is great very quiet and nice view, wow ive been here for both dinner and brunch and its soo so so good the food is extremely well prepared both taste and presentation exceeding expectations the vibe changes from day to night slightly but still has the feel of a tapas lounge throughout the transition

its got great ambience and energy to it located in a really fun part of town, place is nice with a great terrace on a roof brunch menu is well designed although make sure you order dessert at the same time with appetizer and main course big chance they wont have your dessert selection by the time you finished main course sangria is good but requires a lot of rest after one glass too much booze  food is good but nothing else deep sea red fish was not a good choice this fish is dry on a start but making it deep fried makes it ever dryer not good choice for cooking techniques overall is ok price is good but food makes you not come back for brunch again, the place is located in the busy area of the french concession during the week end the best part of the restaurant is the small terrace max 20 people with a view on the big villas around it is quiet the brunch formula below 200 rmb for 3 dishes a drink and a coffee is a good bargain food is not really spanish but more south american by the chef an ex candidate of tv show master chef , the restaurant furnitures start to be old as well as decoration  food is good but not exceptional the only good thing is the terrace  for a restaurant in ferguson lane it could have been better, its one of the tapas restaurant i will recommend you can find many kinds of food on menu not only the taps seafood steak and lamp chop are all tasty
a good place to spending time with friends each portion is not too big so we enjoy to share many dishes and white wine, the fact of being located on popular ferguson lane doesnt make a restaurant good food is just soso the ceviche we had were lumps of fish swimming in a spicy acidic broth had far better ceviche in other latin american restaurants in the city risotto was dry and tasteless and the lamb shank came without any garnish veggies or starch signature dessert was a kind of spanish cream caramel but hard instead of fluffy
service was friendly but not professional and the staff couldnt explain the dishes had to call for the manager no bread served wit the meal
overall very average and definitely not good value, roof top dinning fun food well prepared with generous portions service a little hit and miss but mainly ok be careful of spices when it is marked as hot they mean it, the place was in a building kind of renovated from old so the overall of the environment was nice the menu was quite a typical one with tapas paella etc the portion was very generous though the taste was only soso the price was reason alone given the dish was good i portion also a good place to chill with friend, this is a great place to taste real spanish food you have to try the lobster with rice certainly the best dish on the menu
great ambience and a terrace with great view
a must try in shanghai for foreigners , very well fitting into the former french concession style of ferguson lane eduardo vargas delivers again  modern tapas fair sized portionsplates and alwayz new and seasonal items the appetizer plate was the only slight letdown  but definitely go for the ceviche and the chorizo home made sangria def a must have in hot sumer fast service , i have organised several business team meetings and day events at azul the experience has been great and azul team goes an extra mile to ensure all needs are beyond expectations great team effort and love the place, azul was recommended by friends who live in shanghai and it didn�t disappoint located in the quiet leafy french concession the restaurant occupies the top floor including an outside terrace of a restored art deco building that bustles with cafes and creative agencies

a very eclectic international crowd � you�ll hear several languages

we were there for saturday brunch and word to the wise  make a reservation � the place was hopping the menu is varied but not overwhelming and emphasizes healthyorganic dishes that present as much more the cold fruit tea was unexpected and zingy with lots of flavor the green soup to start spinach asparagus etc was delicious and the tenderloin sandwich was juicy and tender a great start to the day

be sure to walk out onto the terrace for a nice view of the area, offered not only spanish food but rather south american food  peruvian nice and great variety of choices for brunch good value must try the flan you will fall in love with it, azul is one of shanghai old restaurants after moving to this location not sure if original owner still there  food quality is not what it used to be
been there several times and regretfully have to say that there are better tapas places in shanghai
have nice roof top but food is mediocre, disappointed much of the tapas seemed to be made off site wine ran out after first bottle service was ok but all in all a bit of a disappointment comon  put more effort in and stop relying on being foreign as a differentiator, i had not eaten at azul since they moved from dongping lu back then this was a shanghai favorite after reading many favorable reviews i thought it may be time to try again i and my guest arrived at prime time to a very empty restaurant we started with scallops i would like to comment on the flavor of the scallops but cannot they were floating in cheese that completely overpowered the flavor of the scallops we next had what was called a cheese roll this was another uninspiring dish the highlight dish was the ceviche tomato salad the tomatoes were bright red fresh and tasty the citrus worked well with the vegetables we had two other dishes that after two weeks i cannot recall this is a true mark of average both good food and very bad food are memorable the space is definitely nice the service very inattentive after this meal i remember why this restaurant had not been visited in some time there are simply far better options available in shanghai, excellent taste and cool tapas we had a selection of many different tapas and they were really delicious super tasty croquetas the service is quite good and can tell that the food is always prepared in a fancy way taking care till the minimum detail cool for couples and company dinners, not quite sure why this restaurant is listed as spanish mediterranean as it is neither however centralsouth american flavors prevail tostadas with shrimp argentinian steak chimichuri ceviche etc folks get an atlas as this was brunch there were some more conventional offerings such as pancakes with whipped cream i mostly enjoyed a dish of eggs atop roasted burnt potatoes cubes of pork belly also burnt but topped with a minuscule amount of iberico ham the argentinean ribeye was a little overdone for the medium rare request 2 course brunch is 158 some dishes have supplementary pricing and 188 for 2 this includes 1 cold drink beer on tap house winesoft drink or fresh juice set menu also includes coffee tea or hot chocolate to finish cozy restaurant and clearly very popular, we went for first time and well come back soon dont miss the way to roof terrace staff was very nice and commited and the most important food was really good for value coming out fast the touch of presentation makes you feeling relaxed while enjoying the taste with filling portions highly recommended, has been a long time i didnt eat ceviche surprisingly fresh and well presented ceviche and beautiful lunch this is a spot when stop by shanghai, my favorite place to go whether i want to just get a snack and relax or get a whole meal the whole aura of the place is very happy in general which is hard to find nowadays no matter where you go the food is very authentic and by far the best in shanghai i tell my friends and family about it all the time because it is just simply my favorite place to go, james has mentioned this restaurant so many times but last weekend was the first time i had my brunch there the restaurant was busy and fortunately we made reservations before we arrived what a good crowd lots of trendy people as well as family crowds the staff was friendly and bill the restaurant manager helped me with my orders he was really friendly and patient the two of us ordered the salmon crepes seafood pasta beef tapas and a couple of desert we really enjoyed our brunch a lot prices are also very reasonable for rmb 188 u get two main course a desert and a drink we had a great time, stylish restaurant with nice ambience and friendly staff

the restaurant is pretty crowded even though i was there at 145pm for a late saturday lunch

tasty food with generous portion and great view
from the roof top terrace a great place to lay back

will certainly go back again on my next trip to shanghai, azul is a real gem the service is great most waiters speak english and chinese the food was divine and presented like a work of art its a bit pricy but well worth it eating at azul is like vacation for your taste buds

the location of the restaurant is really awesome the building is shared by an amazing bakery a few art galleries and design students its definitely an upbeat and stylish site, this is a must place to visit the atmosphere is really good the service and food is outstanding my favorite is the scallops they are really good, the decoration did not change since my last visit two years ago however it is far from outdated i really like the atmosphere relaxed but for a smart casual public service is good and staff can communicate well in english food is well presented and ingredients seem fresh and of good quality flavor and combination could be improved in some cases the �cheese and spinach empanadas� had very little cheese the �patatas bravas� were place on a tomato sauce base that tasted quite industrialized the �spanish tabla� was actually a tortilla de patatas with a topping of spanish ham that was not clear in the menu finally the red sangria jar could have more and different fruits maybe something to make it a little bit sweeter it was quite bitter and improve its taste since the wine they use is remarkably bad prices are appropriate for such kind of restaurant

overall a reasonably good experience for shanghai standards i will definitely try it again in a better weather, what a wonderful dinner at azul tonight the mix grill was mouth watering all of us love the seafood rice garlic prawns and flan the place is also centrally located too bad it rained tonight and we were unable to sit on the patio definitely coming here again, read about azul tapas  lounge and went there for dinner tonight greeted by friendly staff at the door  first positive sign occupying the top floor the terrace offers an amazing unblocked view of the surrounding highly recommend the tuna tartare in crispy tortilla shell as a starter  you will not regret it for mains the codfish with black squid rice garlic prawns and mix grill were all excellently executed must have dessert  flan and tiramisu bring an appetite and buddies to share the dishes with  youre gonna love this place, i enjoyed this top floor quiet lay back spanish style restaurant in ferguson lane it is a trendy place where you can have a good time with people the food is really tasty and the service effective and very friendly the district is busy and trendy, it was amazing to find such a nice place we went recommended by a friend and was totally worth it an incredible food quality and awesome views from the terraces well be back for sure, might take you a few moments to find in the building complex containing a number of restaurants but your search will be worth it warm prawn ceviche and scallops a la parmesana provided a good start unfortunately the empanadas were sold out so next we had the calamari fritti served with a harissa dip and squid ink aioli  yum the patatas braves were delicious as were the spanish mushrooms the only letdown was the chicken anticuchos containing too much cartilage service was helpful however our mains were too staggered not enabling us to eat the dishes together
the view from the terrace was excellent though beware because its a free for all for the smokers wine list was good, truly a dining delight  overthetop tapas each one even better than the last all terrific and unique warm laidback ambience highlighted by seventh floor indoor dining or on the adjoining balconies with incredible views of the shanghai skyline personal attentive service this place has it all for two or 15the size of our group, i speak no hyperbole when i say that i had the best dinner of my life at azul the chef eduardo vargas is not only a master but an undeniably friendly host as well azul will be a muststop on my next visit to shanghai and it should be on yours too, this place is great for after work hang out with friends and coworkers it is catered to younger crowd of 20 or 30 something food is great and management runs a very tight ship wine selection is ok there are many little places around this location for desert and after dinner drinks, delicious tapas and nice atmosphere slight twist on spanish tapas with the peruvian influence this means some different flavours like lime goats cheese and fresh herbs i particularly liked the goats cheese and edamame beans salad scallop with parmesan the sea bass ceviche the grilled steak tapas and meatballs excellent i would definitely go back, my friends brought me to azul when i was in shanghai and i had a great time the place is really romantic especially the rooftop terrace i ordered the flan and seafood rice and they were wonderful what a wonderful and amazing experience , best atmosphere you will ever encounter at a very classy rooftop lounge i really like the mixed grill and seafood rice i will definitely be recommending this awesome restaurant to everyone, food that makes you wanna cook

this is the place where the flavor a are still good and keep diners coming back all tapas cold or hot provide a great experience the cevices chicken relleno in particular has a wonderful flavor and nice heat dont forget the sangria and iced teas for non alcoholics

service as in many places in shanghai needs more attention on the personality front can you say smile police love to see as much latin passion in the cooking as in the service staff

matre di and hostess got it down now pass some to the wait staff please only thing that would hold us from coming back weekly, we went with our friends from taiwan to this restaurant in shanghai because they wanted to taste the spanish food they looked for this place and it was a graet surprise for us we ate paella fried squid meatballs ham salad and different grilled meats all food was ok
good terrace with great views to the city, one of the few places in shanghai which could keep his business and level on certain levels it has very lovely terrace and perfectly locatedthe owner chef is a shanghai fb veteran who is keeping his food and service quality always on top wine and tapas prices are reasonable in a city where spanish food is terribly expensivewell done, i really enjoy azul i�ve lived in shanghai for nigh on six years now and heard about the place that entire time after going for the first time i wish i would have gone much sooner

the first time i went was for a private dinner a group of business folks get together from time at various restaurants around town and just happened to hold a session at azul chef eduardo vagas was personally in the kitchen and served up course after course of delicious food my favorite had to be the octopus and olive puree i�ve never tasted the combination before as one dinner said �it will make you see the future� not all the dishes were spot on the pork belly was well cooked but overly sweet it tasted like one of those pineapple chuhais one would get in japan

the drink menu continues in the style of chicha vargas�s previous peruvian venture in sinan mansions front and center is certainly south american classics like the pisco sour but the menu also boasts a wide range of gins with an emphasis on enormous gin and tonics the bar manager franky is extremely friendly when we started smoking cigars and asked for a drink recommendation he immediately popped up and grabbed and excellent bottle of cuban rum for us to try i had never thought of rum as a sipping drink but he was right it was well paired with the smokes

i�ve been back a few times since then i like the atmosphere and have sat out on the patio but never for brunch that�s next on my list, i was in azul for brunch today and had an excellent experience the restaurant is centrally located and quality of food was excellent i love the seafood rice fish ceviche and fran the owner has recently renovated the place and changed some of its furniture as a result the whole environment is clean modern and sexy i would definitely bring my date here for a romantic time, we were there a saturday night in april we booked a table on the terrace for drinks with the thought that wed move inside for dinner luckily we had reserved the table outside because it is very popular and got quite busy it was cool but they had an outside heater they comp you a hummus platter and bread which is a nice touch we ended up deciding to stay outside for our meal which was a bit confusing for our waiter but turned out ok in the end we tried the bruschetta shrimp meatballs salad and a mixed grill board that was deelish clean bathroom which is a plus will be back, azul tapas lounge is well located in ferguson lane off the leafy wukang lu it takes a bit of luck but travel by lift to the 7th floor and follow the signs carefully if you get it right you will spot the sign near a twisty set of stairs which you need to climb in order to arrive at the restaurant entry the plus side is youve worked up an appetite and youve earned it

the physical aspects of the place such as looking through a huge semitransparent clock face from the inside modern comfortable fit out and nice views across leafy french concession to distant pudong from the outdoor balcony area were certainly the highlight for us

our light lunch dishes ordered were not particularly south american a couple of salads a bbq pork roll and a smoked salmon roll along with a couple of healthy fruit juices when they eventually turned up and it took a few reminders to the waiters we found the dishes pretty average the spinach  walnut salad and the tuna salad both had too much oily dressing some of the lettuce leaves were decidedly not fresh either the bbq pork roll was simple but nice the salmon roll with chips was ok but nothing special the drinks when they eventually arrived halfway through the meal were nice and fresh

several other aspects of the restaurant during our visit also let the place down visiting around lunchtime on a weekend made the place chaotic its quite normal in french concession but sadly it wasnt managed well at all it certainly wasnt a buzzing atmosphere we had children from other families bumping into our table without any oversight from their parents nearby most customers appeared to be tourists with photo sessions being held all around us throughout our meal tables were not properly cleared and reset after customers left we had to ask repeatedly for plates and cutlery once our dishes started to arrive we even had to ask for service to place our order to get out drinks served to have our main served and twice amazingly in shanghai to get our bill

there was certainly was no thought by staff to ask whether our meal experience was satisfactory when we were settling our bill just as well, we went over there to celebrate my girlfriend bday i booked a table on the small terrace once arrived there was no table after speaking with the manager we found a solution easily
the food was good tasty portions ok and price totally worth it for what you are eating for we took 5 tapas 1 bottle of wine and woter and it was around 700 rmb
the view from the small terrace was very nice staff was gentle and helpful, went there for saturday brunch with a friend food was very nice portion was more on the bigger side my friends food was extremely delicious i ordered steak  eggs asked for medium rare however they made it medium well overall service is good would definitely return pity the weather was still a little cold when we visited otherwise would love to sit at the outdoor patio, i been in shanghai since 2002 and azul is one of the few places open and still running well from 2002 in a city where every month open and close places where trend and fashion is happening like no where else azul keeps a good price honest food and delicious taste i highly recommend you this place , i had dinner at azul last night and it was a great experience i was alone so i just chose 2 tapasthe servings are big and i couldnt finish any of them the food was great and the service attentive i recommend it, ferguson lane is an area packed with restaurants in the heart of the french concession azul has pretty good tapas and its set in a nice atmosphere the rooftop patio is particularly nice in the summer where it gets gentle breezes among the treetops in the evening cant recommend the lunch but the evening meals are generally quite good","hot pot house",0.999361635453009
79,"really nice thai food for reasonable prices also very friendly staff and great service which serve you the best way, in a nutshell urban thai is a cute little place with a nice atmosphere the food they serve is good but the menu selection quite mediocre  and not unlike a million thai places in every part of the world lots of deep fried proteins lots of coconuty curries lots of basil you get the picture
it seems the kitchen is competent enough thai lady cooking but perhaps the french management is just not gutsy enough to break out of the tried and tested mould and give them a freer hand
seems like a place with too much untapped potential to waste another evening on, my friend and i went here and had both dinner and dessert i had some vegetarian thai noodles which were superb and as my dessert i got the mango sticky rice which was amazeballs too both of us had the lime ice tea and i would most certainly recommend all of these to others the service was great and the place was beautiful you have to go, we went with friends to this place and were surprised with the good thai food the little spring rolls papaya salad the green beef curry the mixed veggies the coconut soup everything tasted very good and the staff was very friendly and helpful a very nice place to visit this street in shanghai has a lot of very good international restaurants and bars a very nice part of town to visit, food was really nice and staff was friendly had a lot of different dishes and all were good good experience, good menu excellent green curry papaya salad was too spicy for both my colleague and myself but they tempered other dishes when we told them portions are large and be careful not to over order near my hotel in shanghai will be back, great thai food we loved it dishes were unusual but very good enjoyed the atmosphere and had nice talk with manager good guy, i went with a large group of friends that pretty much took up the whole of the upper level but it was quite lovely throughout the entire restaurant you definitely get a taste of thai in just the decor but its not overdone my first impression in walking in was that this would be a great date night kind of place however they are clearly able to accommodate large groups and the service was great they provided a drink table so that we could help ourselves rather than waiting for a server to refill our water glasses etc the food was wonderful and delicious i was visiting this place about a week after id been to thailand and i honestly couldnt tell the difference it felt like i was back in thailand when i ate that food overall a great chance to enjoy thailand in shanghai without the flight, i liked to try some thai cuisine when i was visiting shanghai during the weekend trip urban thai is the one with a higher rate had thai green curry with rice and a cup of thai iced tea both of them were good will visit there next time with friends so could try more dishes, since first time its 3d time i go to urban thai for dinner i enjoy their relaxing and clean ambiance as well as fast and delicious food curry and pineapple rice are my favorite beside other dishes reasonable price for 4 persons, i went here today with my girlfriend we ordered 2 appetisers 2 main courses and ice cream to finish everything was good no food left on the plates and i highly recommend the fried rice with beef, just got back from a 7 day vacation to shanghai heard the good reviews about urban thai and decided to make a visit the restaurant itself is a little bit hard to find its roughly a 1520 minute walk from the peoples square metro station but in the end the food was so worth it i only went by myself and i could barely finish the 3 plates that i ordered i ordered fried pork meatballs as an appetizer pad ka pow chicken spicy chicken with basil leaves and mussaman beef curry the 3 entrees that i ordered could have easily served 3 people anyways excellent food good mixes of spicy sweet tangy and savory be warned though youre not going to pay bangkok prices for this food its in shanghai china after all but in the end as the old saying goes you get what you paid for and i think this is some of the best food you will have in shanghai period and its worth paying the extra money the staff was friendly and professional the environment felt like i was eating in a small cafe in bangkok highly recommended, loved the food  from soup to appetizers to drinks and the main meal flavorful good ambiance and decent service even though they were full good veggie selection as well, i have been a fan of urban thai for years but this was my first time to eat at the dagu location this location is bigger and has a great atmosphere to eat with friends urban thai has the best thai iced tea in shanghai its hard not to drink all of the iced in one sip since it reminds you of thailand my friend and i shared the assorted finger food plate which was a perfect appetizer for two people to share the spring rolls were crunchy and served with a dipping sauce that added a nice sweet factor normally im not a fan of fish cakes however good use of ingredients brought out the flavor of the spices the curry puff had a nice contrast of crunchy and soft the chicken satay was served with a peanut sauce this is an excellent appetizer for someone that likes a variety of food or is unsure which appetizer to try i ordered the pork green curry and rice for my main dish this is my go to dish when i have had a bad day or a long day at work the spice level is perfect but you can also order this dish extra spicy thin slices of pork allows the curry flavor to absorb into the meat my friend enjoyed eating the large portion of pad thai and had leftovers we also shared mango sticky rice for dessert the waiter brought us free shots to drink with our dessert the coconut shot was a fantastic drink at the end of the meal i will definitely go back to this location, in shanghai with the abundance of thai restaurants in shanghai urban thai is among the best the food came fast and hot the curry had the perfect balance of spice and taste papaya salad was a little fishy but good a good papaya salad should be fishy my personal favourite was the fried basil with pork urban thai is the most authentic thai restaurant that ive been to outside of thailand i highly recommend this place go hungry leave happy, amazing service friendly staff good food decor is beautiful very thai the food the dress of the staff the interior everything just says thai, very good foods and nice service from this thailand restaurant we def gonna visit this place again and very soon the fish is da best, the interior of the restaurant is really nice you feel welcome when entering the choice of music was good the stuff were very helpfull and kind we directly felt that we could have a relaxing meal there the food was good but not amazing we ate different plates but none of them really impressed me the food was good no more no less as dessert we ate icecream the icecream was not so good in general we had a nice dinner and left the restaurant with a happy face if u want to eat something easy and dont want to wait a long time urban thai is the place to be ps the long table for 6 persons is a nice concept so this restaurant is prefect when you want to eat with friends or celebrate something, had a lovely evening with my gf there fine thai dishes great juices and with a attentive service i recommend that place, been there for a birthday party the food had a good timing and the service very friendly
we get several rounds of mangocello offer by the manager super nice touch to finish a wonderful birthday, had a fantastic lunch here last week the food is so flavorful and delicious the service is excellent the price is very reasonable well worthwhile i cant wait to go back for a nice dinner, decent place quality and menu choice are enough for appreciate their quality id say a good place resembling thai recipies however id keep one star more for top level thai restaurant, just had the best dinner at urban thai dagu lu the sweet and sour fish was amazing  the beef soup with rice yummy and something you should try for sure is the coconut pudding i mean come on, i really like thai food so when i can i always try to go to this place or order from sherpas the service is very polite the place is clean and the food is super tasty my best dishes are for sure the mango and sticky rice as im a dessert lover and the new meatball their tea cocktail is super good and the price is really affordable for everyone, my headline might sound materialistic but for the last 34 years the balance between food quality and what one is asked to pay is not in equilibrium anymore

this place has two floors during lunch time the guests are welcomed on the first floor
decor is ok and comfortable my wife had a tom yum goong soup which was not as refreshing as in thailand and more on the creamy side nevertheless it was still good
i had a coconut chicken soup

my wifes main course was a green beef curry nicely sliced i had a spicy chicken dish with peanuts unfortunately i do not remember the name thai iced tea and hot thai coffee were properly done as well

staff was friendly and attentive will go back for more, i cant believe i waited so long to try urban thai its right across the street from my apartment complex the food is excellent and the service was great the green curry was incredible and the appetizer platter was was delicious  i think the food quality is comparable to coconut paradise but much less expensive and light years ahead of most of the thai places in town we will be frequent visitors in the future, was really impressed with urban thai i heard lots about them nice atmosphere and decor service had good level of english food was really tasting will come back again or try the other branch, really good green curry to a low price i really recommend it if you like thai curry the personnel was friendly and i plan to go back soon, visited urban thai a few times good lunch menu and authentic thai dishes like their curry and fried rice they also deliver to the neighborhood, love this place  right down the end of dagu road its worth walking past all the other restaurants to get to this one quite a cool feel to the place but very friendly and also very happy to offer local advice my test of a great thai is whether i end up spooning green curry sauce into my mouth still not quite believing how good it tastes they passed, great experience food and  service they have those fried curry puff that are kind of thai empenadas so good also really good and refreshing thai iced tea  mango sticky rice is same as thailand street food so good, really nice and beautiful design atmosphere is cosy loved their selection of foods papaya salad was fresh thai iced tea was prefect dessert we took 2 mango sticky rice so good, coming from australia we do have quite lots of thai restaurants there too but urban thai is probably the best thai food i had in a long time decor is super nice and service is great for people like me that cant handle too much spiciness they asked me first how i wanted my dishes the green curry is a must try but they also have the salmon salad and crab curry that are good also a chilled chang beer always bring good memories from thailand , very good thai restaurant in shanghai very well located perfect for business lunch very nice atmosphere and perfect service, the intimate setting of the restaurant is very nicegood food drinks and decorit is also great that the management staff speak english, we found this place on trip advisor and where not disappointed the food was great and the staff so very friendly if we visit shanghai again we will definitely come back, this restaurant is able to serve good food which is very difficult where to find in china urban thai has a real thai cook everybody address her mummy she is very nice and tries also to entertain people

we tried many times the green chicken curry and chicken wrapped with pandan leaves both dishes were perfectly cooked it is a real food exactly how it should be

the ambience is relaxing music is calm and they have friendly staffs

recommended, the restaurant has a thai chef which is also shareholder she has a real gift to make thai food unbelievable talent call the restaurant first to ensure that she will be there they have two restaurants and you should confirm in which one she will work tonight

we have been here now at least 5 times within 10 days the dishes are realy extraordinary good especially the green curry is now for me the reference thai green curry thin slices of chicken creamy from real coconut milk not too mild and not too spicy vegetables definitely fresh that is how it should be and other restaurants will hardly compete with them

we actually are not people who eat too much but here we decided that we want to reorder even we have been actually full it is a dream the restaurant makes a clean friendly and elegant impression service is very considerate and friendly it is like you make a short holliday trip to a different country and by the way the price is really reasonable, staff promptly helped me to a table and gave me the different menu choices
i tried the spring rolls thom kha gai thai fried rice and pad thai all of them were very good portions are a very good size as well and it offers good value for money
i would come back to try some more dishes for sure, its a very cozy restaurant nice ambient music my very first impresion when i tasted my plate was that it was made with fresh ingredients and home made
i would like to go back and try more plates form the menu i am sure they will be delicious, im a regular business visitor to shanghai and urban thai is one of the best places ive found to eat out � either on my own or in a group the food is really fantastic the staff welcoming and well informed and the atmosphere is just great if youre new to thai food or a seasoned regular i couldnt recommend this restaurant more highly, having heard good reports about urban thai we decided to try the dagu lu branch for their set lunch recently and wha a disappointing experiencetired decor tiredlooking menus and even worse terrible food my thai bbq d chicken was nothing like what i expected comprising a handful of fatty bony small pieces of choppedup chicken with minimal flavour accompanied by generic thai sweet chili sauce and some fairly bland coconut rice my companions green curries and chicken with cashews were rated ordinary and our thai tea was unpleasant and barely warm the wait staff were pleasant enough but this was outweighed by the chef who kept wandering in and out of the dining area in his chefs outfit and the rather haughty foreigner who processed our payment as we left in short there is far better food and far better value to be had on dagu lu and if this is the best they can do i certainly would not recommend this restaurant, we went to urban thai for lunch and had a really good time lunch service is very efficient and all dishes are served at the right time  so we could really relax there is a large variety of dishes from traditional tom yum soup just the right level of spices for us  and pad thai to chicken bbq and thai green curries  all served in generous portions and with just the right blend of spices which for me is the most important in thai cuisine selection of wines is appropriate and also served by the glass so  chapeau bas , one of the best thai restaurants ive been to the staff is great food is excellent and atmosphere is fantastic, i went to this place about three times and each of my visit is impressive

the first time i went to urban thai i was having a group dinner with my friends we were about 20 people and they have a spacious place for all of us in the second floor the food were all amazing it went beyond my expectation moreover the service was so great that it feels just like home for this i would like to thank mr yoan who arranged that night well and all of his staffs big thanks

for my second and third visits i had a dinner with some of my friends the food was as delicious as usual

for sure urban thai is one of my favorite restaurant in town, large variety of dishes well prepared service is great staff is super friendly and you know how hard it is to find good service in shanghai  and atmosphere is very relaxing, i went during restaurant week and got a lot of food for a good deal nice selection of dishes food was very good but mango sticky rice had mango that wasnt quite ripe the cocktails are good but for their signature cocktails have no description in english of what is in them and no one could tell us in english small place but cozy on an interesting street with many other places to stop in for a drink or dessert i wouldnt go again because it is so far away from pudong and there are enough similar places closer to me, came here and held a birthday dinner good location nice atmosphere the food was unanimously rated as excellent from all the guests loved it will definitely recommend it to friends, urban thai is by far the best thai restaurant in shanghai i just loved my experience there with my friends the quality of food is really high and all the ingredients were very fresh they have one of the best service i have seen in china the staff is very friendly and helpful something that is rare in china my favorite dish was the som tam and i really recommend the place for anyone looking for an authentic thai experience in shanghai and the best part is that it all comes at a very affordable price, i was happy to take part of the charity dinner organized by urban thai restaurant where the profit was directed to children whose parents are in prison the menu they offered was amazing as it consisted of starter soup main dish dessert and drink moreover with the price and amount of food they offered i would say it was more than a good deal in terms of food i would like to point out their assorted finger food plate which consisted of several delicious snacks and tom kha  chicken coconut soup which was my absolute favorite the main dish selection they had was huge and consisted of several options starting from carry dishes noodle dishes etc however from all these choices they had only one choice for a dessert which was coconut pudding again very thai in conclusion i would say it is very authentic restaurant for a thai food and excellent place for the big fans for the specific kitchen","bar",0.999779152779175
8,"great atmosphere fantastic food we went with friends who ordered for us we had vegetable flat bread prawn curry green beans tofu chicken and green peppers and sticky rice all delicious service excellent the toilets are an experience i wont spoil the surprise but look through the mirror, weve been back each year to fine the food is great and the atmosphere exciting
service is very good too although not a lot of english spoken, went along on the strength of the reviews and loved it yes it�s a bit dark and when full fairly noisy but i loved the bustle of the place just my husband and i for dinner had a couple of cocktails and shared plates and it was really reasonable prices food was tasty and service was friendly loved the bathrooms very funny took me a few seconds of staring at a stranger in the mirror to realise what was happening would go back for sure, restaurant setting in a beautiful old house in the old french concession area trendy bar scene with dim but romantic lighting the deco is simply beautiful specialized in ethnic tribal yunnan cuisines all excellently prepared top notch service too a dining experience one should not missed when visiting shanghai, went to the branch near the bund

very convenient

on my must visit list when i go to shanghai

sichuan fish is amazing

service very good

its always busy so book in advance

also try samosas, whenever people visit me in shanghai i always take them here excellent place to go with family and friends aside from the food also really nice atmosphere, yunnan style restaurant near the bund quite casual and relaxed atmosphere friendly staff the food is absolutely incredible very delicious dishes at a reasonable price you need a reservation or some luck to get in, what can i say my second visit to this restaurant in shanghai and again it did not disappoint the food and cold tsingtao beer brown bottle were on point i highly recommend the shrimp spring rolls and the bao chicken similar to kung pao elsewhere in the world i would be led to believe that most dishes at lost heaven are worth trying lastly and im not sure why but i love the bathroom at the former french concession location floating flowers around the sink and the ability to stare at the opposite sex washing her hands across from you is a very novel approach to something different in the restroom yet still maintaining a sense of privacy when you are doing your business dimly light but very hip, really nice and big location food also really good i would always go for family style food to share loved the lamb samosas and crab cakes service as ok but thats china, was there for dinner recommended by the hotel a nice dinning experience with pretty nice ambience however we find the place a bit too dim for our liking though food wise there have a lot of variety do ask the server for recommendations so you wont go wrong yunan cuisine and something different from usual shanghainess fare not quite bad though worth a try if you are in shanghai, was looking for a really good restaurant that didnt max out the budget and this place exceeded my expectations

its situated in a quiet area and is quite a way away from the metro station but its worth the walk

the restaurant itself is very dark but had a really good atmosphere

i started with the spring rolls which were nice but i absolutely loved the chicken in soy sauce

there honestly wasnt any room left to try to dessert

this place is a must if youre in shanghai, been there couple times already every time feeling chinese food lost heaven is on the top choice for sure friends also love it just not easy to book a table sometimes love the food roof top bar is also a great place for drinks, really nicely decorated restaurant with good food and wines the restaurant has several floors traditional dishes from all over china and staff wearing traditional clothes we had a lovely evening, tucked incognito is this wonderful restaurant called the lost heaven it is indeed a culinary paradise appropriately addressed in the name itself the dimly lit jaunt has a romantic setting with ethnic interiors the food itself creates a riot of flavours on the pallet and trust you me that tickles of great food leave a solid memory the food itself is not for those who seek mild european flavors


we started the evening with a house cocktail followed by lamb samosoa spring rolls and stir fried beans in shrimp paste these were followed by prawns in sweet and sour sauce to die for and shredded chicken in coriander accompany the main course with stick rice

a must do at shanghai, good experience and service food is excellent  different flavor compare to usual shanghai kitchen with friends or business, good food but have tried better yunnan cuisine nice ambience and 90 foreigners great place to entertain friends in town outside the restaurant you will find some nice old shanghai buildingsstructures staff is friendly and efficient but great if they can smile more, enjoyed the food with our group beautiful table settings fruit dessert was gorgeous delicious food nice staff recommend, this is a must in shanghai whether you are on business or in holiday beautifully decorated and out of this world food prepare to eat a lot and share with your table choices for all very good vegetarian options, i been to this restaurant with my boyfriends and his colleague it was just amazing still cant forget how the food melted my mouth what a nice concept and quick response from the staff which is so great and i will definetely b back again very very recommended, best asian cuisine i have ever tasted we had several appetizers a good glass of red wine and i had the gon boa which was so delicious it was perfect nice atmosphere and centrally located not far away from the bund friendly staff and service, this is a atmosphere restaurant where the ambience and the crowd expats make the difference but when it come to food is a total concern big dishes in the american style with poor taste and poor art of cooking mixing up traditional chinese cuisine with thai napalese and indian in a confused understanding of it all to avoid, nice place to be and good food we liked the kind service absolutely planning to go back
a lot of locals in the house is always good, just a few steps away from the bond you will find this magnificent place and if you do not know it is a restaurant you can almost miss it i thought it was an art gallery and this was just memory lane showing the origins of the restaurant on the ground floor beautiful pics and wooden interior you need to go to the second floor where you will find an exquisite decor and elegant romantic rooms the food is heavenly good and also the fresh juices great service and perfect to celebrate all good things in life just walk tomthe corner and the bond is there with magnificent views of shanghai skyline recommend this restaurant and for sure will go back next time i am in shanghai, i came to this restaurant several times before i enjoyed it to an extent but this time i was really disappointed
the food took more than 30 minutes to arrive first the rice came then the fish 30 minutes after i ended filling my belly with rice
the cod was probably the worst i had in my life not only it came very very late but it tasted bad just because its covered with tasteless black truffle doesnt necessary means its good

i told the waitress i want the bill please i didnt enjoy the food she couldnt care less saying ok got the bill in 2 seconds and told me bye bye

i wont return again, i have been to lost heaven near the bund at least 10 times the outdoor bar upstairs is incredible with cocktails from the yunnan province as well as conventional fare this is a not to be missed place the inside bar is nearly as delicious
the cuisine is like nothing else i have had anywhere in the world the spices are sublime the choices are mind boggling especially love the green tea salad and the staff are extremely helpful and attentive whenever we entertain newcomers to shanghai we almost always start here
as crazy as it sounds the washrooms are a treat unto themselves among the best in the city along with shintori go and enjoy i could pass many hours sitting outside at the upstairs bar outside just enjoying the atmosphere and views you wont be sorry for having spent time here, great atmosphere very romantic place the restaurant is amazing asian style
the food is fantastic must try, lets say they serve chinese food westerners friendly traditional food reinvented and adapted to occidental tastes
located in the french concession it is very convenient to enjoy a chinese experience in a very trendy environment better chose this one instead of the one they have at the bund
i highly recommend poultry meat and fish available good wines correct prices, we combined the dinner at lost heaven with the bund river cruise and were not disappointed we couldnt get terrace seat although we booked a day before it is ideal to go with group since they have a huge menu and huge servings i can not comment whether it is authentic yunanese food but whatever we had we loved it it has wide variety of spicy to semi spicy dishes and the staff is so very helpful in choosing your perfect option the soup was fantastic although it was enough for 5 and we were only 2 and we were so full but still packed our remaining food i will suggest this place for someone who like different spices in food and is willing ti experiment a bit with hot flavours although they have other options very well made as well

try the bar in open area and book early, either for lunch or dinner the dishes are yummy and the atmosphere is nice maybe a bit noisy as all branches are large space but it definitely worth a visit any of their branch is a good option my favorite is the one in the ffc, we were a large group and enjoyed our meal at lost heaven we commenced with drinks in their bar on the top floor good outside area if the weather is warm and then ate in the restaurant the food is very good and the service is attentive the place was full of a good mix of local and international diners and was clearly very popular, wide range of choice from yunnan and xinjiang nice decorations prices are affordable and the service is great, got seated right before end of lunch period so we were somewhat rushed our food was very good not inexpensive mostly go for unique atmosphere, very tasty food and lovely ambience perfect for travelers passing by shanghai as well as for long timers in shnaghai, we had an amazing meal here we chose 4 starters and 4 mains and when the waiter came to take our order he advised us to change 3 of each of them we did and we were totally blown away he gave such good advice and was very attentive ensuring we were happy with the choices, if you havent been to one of the lost heaven restaurants its time to go the beautifully decorated restaurants are a must go staff is usually fast and reliable food is extraordinary yunnan kitchen style many foreigners bring their visitors to lost heaven  a place you may impress your western friends with great food and traditional but stylish chinese decoration prices are upper level, we are here because we were staying just around the corner we read other reviews which said it was very noisy crowded etc but we just went for it  the night was zero degrees and we were hungry 
pleasant surprise great food good atmosphere and i was expecting loud music cramped tables but we had a delicious meal, we were on our 3rd visit back and everytime its the food that takes me back the issue is when you are a big group its very noisy so advise a smaller group
the foods great lots of different flavours and great when people fancy tasting different options
but it never dissapoints me as the food is so wonderful, i loved this restaurant there is a wide range of dishes to suit every taste and the prices are not crazy given the quality my noodle dish was 68 rmb and we had a curry for 98rmb  standard for the bund wine was very reasonable with a pinot noir 290 rmb which is a lot less than other places the restaurant itself is vast but feels quite friendly we got a bit unlucky with our seating in that it was a smallish table in between two other couples  and one couple were having a row it didnt spoil our dinner though because of the quality of the food it is a must do if you want to have quality chinese food, it took a very long time to get our food and our drinks food was not as good as some much less expensive places in shanghai would not return, well worth a visit
if the weather permits have a drink upstairs on the roof terrace 
great food theyll also split your bill for large groups too, i loved this place and will take all future visitors here its such a great way to taste lots of sichuan cuisine if you arent really sure what to get because everything here is extremely well made, not a place you are going to go to every month but when you have a special occasion guests business context taking them to this place is pretty cool the food of yunnan has somehow been modernized with nice cocktails to go with it and a little fusion feeling so that you can have a cool evening out at this restaurant the bill wont kill you either considering how cool the place is

the one on the bund is also very cool and boasts a rooftop bar, lost heaven really does its name justice with its mysterious templelike atmosphere you feel like in another world the restaurant offers a great variety of dishes and its fun to order many different ones in a group of friends and try different flavours even though the prices for the dishes are not that pricey from about 50 rmb per dish its up to you how much you want to spend its easy ending up with a 700 rmb bill between two people but you can also spend as little as 300 if you dont opt for expensive drinks and unnecessary side dishes this place is great for sampling yunnan cuisine coming in a big group of friends just as a couple and especially to bring visiting friends and family for a local taste we marginally preferred this branch in the french concession to the one on the bund even though that felt slightly more luxurious as it has three floors and the tables are a bit more spread out making it less noisy and more cosy the only negative aspect i can add is that both times we visited the restaurant we felt quite cold, loved the food quite a posh place for yunan food was slightly dark loved the terrace and the cocktails also compatible with parents you want to show around shanghai, a group of work colleagues ate here the bund location several times in january 2017 and loved it every time they have a tremendous selection of food and covers everything from meat lovers to vegetarians of which we had both service is good and prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get

they have some interesting drink selections too

atmosphere is really neat too as it has the very high ceilings large chairs and tables along with interesting decor there are some seats that are very dark though as they have targeted lighting at some spots i needed to get my phone out to use the flashlight on the menu

i would highly recommend lost heaven but make a reservation, lost heaven used to be a very popular restaurant for foreigners and visitors in shanghai
however it has not managed to keep its charm and taste, really great selection of chinese and fusion food would say its mid to high price range and you get ripped off for water especially for their cocktails but food is worth the price and the ambience is really nice can stroll on the bund after so location is perfect i have been back twice to this restaurant, we go to high end restaurants and are willing to pay the price but $12 for water is transparently silly whats your mark up, its the best restaurant in shanghai for me its in french concession so no amazing views outside the window but he rest was simply great perfect price and quality balance, this restaurant was recommended and reservations were made by our hotel concierge in shanghai i was disappointed in the service that my husband and i received at this restaurant lost service i mean lost heaven after being escorted upstairs by a friendly hostess to be seated  we didnt get our order taken until 15 minutes after sitting down had we not called over to the waiter to let him know that we were ready to order who knows how long we would have sat there and not receive service we ordered fish broccoli eggplant steamed rice and juices to drink after placing our order 2 other tables were seated in the same area that we were in one party of 46 people and the other was a couple the waiter that took our order worked with a female server as well and they worked together to assist or lack of assistance in our case guests seated in their station we waited for a while for our order and noticed that the two other parties that arrived after us received food before we got our food we were contemplating on leaving because we traveled 5 hours from bejing and were a little tired but we were more hungry than tired besides we were only going to be in shanghai for a few days and we wanted to experience all we can in the short time that we were there  shortly after asking our server about our order that we placed we received our broccoli we waited from 35 minutes and we received our next item which was the eggplant each item came out one at a time close to 5 minutes after the previous dish by the time we received our rice the broccoli temperature was tepid not to mention we still hadnt received our order of fish we starting eating the food that was given to us and several minutes past and no fish so of course we inquired about it to the female server and the male waiter shortly came over and said i thought you didnt want it what we placed the order with you why wouldnt we want it  we asked during the hour long lack of service the two servers were consistent they didnt ask us hows the food did you need anything else more juice the food wasnt that tasty either and one reason may have been because it was tepid from the intervals of receiving each food item however i must notate that the service was just like the food tepid","Italian cuisine",0.642544791273494
81,"we have lived 200 metres from this restaurant for almost 3 years and never noticed it not easy to find but well worth the adventure we ordered steamed fish with soy ginger and garlic it was not on the menu i just felt like it the chef did a great job all other dishes superb also we will be going back with the kids, i went with two colleagues from our local office for dinner tonight our venue selection was primarily based on my reading of previous reviews on this site and my colleagues search through the local foodie websites the dishes were authentic and good but we were concerned that they would not be so as we were the only asian diners on a saturday night the marinated pork cubes are as good or even better than the ones at more famous shanghainese restaurants, one of my favourites in shanghai good service and great selection of typical chinese food very recommendable, this restaurant was recommended by a frequent visitor as one of the best in town for shanghainese food the place is a little hard to find but once there you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality decor and hospitable staff most speak some english and when we were there at least half of the guests were foreigners

food was a mixed bag while the crispy duck was named by many reviewers as a must try we found that it was not as light and crispy as we would like and while ok im taste it was nothing special the deep fried dumplings were mediocre and the shell was too thick and chewy on the other hand the green bean sheets with pickled vegetables was outstandingit was something like glass noodles in a thick and flat pappardelle style but the textures and flavor were unusual and tasty the lotus root with glutinous rice was very delicately flavored and not for everyone but we liked it the tea was delicious

service was friendly and attentive and the waiter went out of his way to call a cab walk us to the street and make sure that the driver knew our destination, 1221 is somewhat hard to find but once there youll be treated with very well prepared traditional chinese food the staff is very attentive and they also speak good english and they try to make sure that you get the best experience you can
if youre not sure what to order ask the waiter for a suggestion of mixed dishes and youll be fine very good food for both meat lovers and vegetarians
trying to go here at least once every time im in shanghai, noisy as allways but i really love the chicken in lemon sauce and the very spicy beef sezuan style, best chinese food for international taste service excellent  good wine also available the service very high quality chinese food, have often visited this great restaurant with friendly staff and even better food it is often very busy on account of the quality of food, good food  good prices good wines and beers friendly staff im already visiting this restaurant for 15 years when im in shanghai for business its always good , great for couples or groups of up to 10 fantastic food we had the virgin menu which was a delicious selection of chinese dishes bread crispy fried duck chicken and cashew nuts beef stirfry broccoli beans rice king prawns followed by stickyrice pudding which including 2 large beers the bill for 2 was 360 the staff even offered to call a taxi for us and let us know when it had arrived highly recommended, came across this place when trying to find a place to host out of towners location is not ideal but tasty food good service and cleanliness puts it on one of my tops list for shanghainese food, 1221 has been a staple for chinese dining with international standards for atmosphere food quality and consistency service and cuisine for me as long as ive been in shanghai 16+ years

there is not a single other restaurant in shanghai that i can say has had a perfect track record for each and every dining visit from the cordial greeting as your arrive to attentive yet unobtrusive service constantly refilling glasses replacing and clearing dishes to assistance calling a taxi service is perfectly professional and warm the fact that most of the staff have been there for as longer than i have been a customer speak volumes about proprietor michelle lius management style

crispy boneless duck lazijiding spicy popcorn chicken shuizhi niurou sliced beef in spicy oil with sesame bread loaf ganbian siji dou dry fried green string beans sweet and sour fish gonbao jiding kungpao chicken hongshaorou fatty braised pork 8treasure sticky rice and friend mantou are must have classics that you cannot go wrong with, one of my top 5 restaurants in the entire world have been to many countries this restaurant hits the mark for local cuisine staff is incredible friendly called a taxi and took us out to taxi with an umbrella to avoid the rain food is out of this world with a must do specialty dessert prepared nightly, this is the place if you want to have a real shanghai meal experience without feeling overwhelmed amazing menu super friendly staff highest quality and standards had the shanghainese noodles spring rolls sauted spicy beef and other delicious treats i recommend it for dinner and you wont regret it, if you want to taste great chinese food in a nice environment this is the right place to go shanghainese and sichuanese food at the best fair prices, if you want to experience chinese food in shanghai and be sure that you will enjoy it 1221 is the place to go although it might be a bit of trouble finding it it is worth a visit whats great about 1221 is that there are usually as many locals as foreigners which for me is a good sign i would recommend ordering many different dishes and sharing since there is so many tasty things you should try i have taken many of my friends and relatives old and young and they have all enjoyed it, business dinner for two included numerous tasty dishes and great service will definitely return next time i am in shanghai either with colleagues or with family, good food nothing to rave about and quick clean service the chilli chicken is to literally die for we had a set menu for 12 people and i must say that the waitresses where very attentive and very nice however i must say that i have had better chinese in other restaurants in and out of shanghai, a very good western chinese if that is possible 1221 offers good food in a nice setting it is a little crowded and the food is not 100 chinese but good if you are not so adventurous, we had to celibate with 14 people and had a great dinner here
we enjoyed the good and honest chinese food for a reasonable price
i always visit when i am in shanghai, always great food at reasonable price staff friendly  helpful have been coming here for nearly 10 years on every visit to shanghai never disappointed, went with 5 colleagues for supper on a saturday night around 7ish helpful polite staff good food  slightly adapted to western palates  good value and a very pleasant evening all round

all had plenty to eat from a set meal total cost with beer and wine was under 900 rmb

chicken with cashews and popcorn chicken with chilli were particularly good

taxis there found it easily and return cab arranged easily by restaurant, really enjoyed the food here id read about this place on trip advisor and it was close to the hotel we were staying in we completely over ordered  eyes bigger than our bellies   but the food tasted great slightly slow service  i guess because it was so busy vegetables came out about 30 minutes after rest of our food so it was kind of after the event so were left untouched

really nice atmosphere though would definitely recommend great desserts also, a quite decent restaurant to bring foreign friends  including taiwanese and hongkong people  for shanghainese cooking
easy to remember reasonable price only the real shanghai people would not accept the dishes are authentic enough to be called benbang cai  shanghai style of cooking  but who cares still quite tasty

if you want to try the real benbang cai you go to the xinjishi  41 tianping rd  or jinmao  golden angkor 543 xinhua rd  both gives you authentic shanghai cuisine with reasonable price

these restaurants have been serving over 15 years some even longer all quite good, it was very yummy and service was friendly its more a place for foreigners cause its too boring for locals but i will cone again any time, took a friend from hong kong to 1221 dining room for dinner last night this is my favorite place unlike the other shanghainese restaurants that are located inside shopping malls 1221 is located at the small alley when you are seated the staff there will make you the ba bao tea and you will be amazed with the special water pot that hes carrying 
dont get surprised when you find more foreigners in this restaurant however they do serve the most traditional shanghainese cuisine and price is so reasonable

beef fillet in chilli sauce with sesame bread  the best
of course xiaolongbao dumpling is good and i also like their sweet and sour fish whole fish
prawns or shrimps
all very delicious

you should not miss their dessert besides the traditional shanghai dessert pancake with red bean paste also the pan fried ba bao rice with red bean paste + bananawhich is my favourite
and they also serve several kinds of italian icecream  chocolate coconut pineappleetc

this is the place that you should not miss if you travel to shanghai

if you take a taxi tell the taxi driver  1221 yan an west road near fan yu road and its just inside the small alley, friendly atmosphere mostly foreigner but also local people management speaks english perfectly which is great to know more about what kind of dishes they serve food choice is amazing almost 10 pages for the menu and anything we tried was really great both quantityquality try out the deepfried lemon chicken you wont regret it reasonable prices we paid rmb 400 for 4 dishes + beers + appetizers booking is highly recommended as the place is now definitely renowned among the expat community, this is now the worst kept secret in the city and probably best to book a table to avoid being disappointed the best chinese food any where in the world great service fabulous dining experience and will have you drinking lots of tea just to watch the waiter pour i recommend asking the staff to add a dish as i have been here many times and everything has always been exceptional, some of the best food i had in shanghai went with a group of friends and ordered a variety of dishes which were fresh and delicious the staff were friendly and made up a table especially for us the service was top notch would absolutely recommend this place to anyone visiting shanghai, ive first ate here over 10 years ago this restaurant has been very popular for foreigners how best to describe this restaurant well the atmosphere decor and staff reminds me of typical chinese restaurant in new yorks chinatown

the food is good chinese food but suitable to westerners taste buds as well therefore this restaurant has always had a large follower of foreigners so with a large foreigner presence it reminds me of typical chinatown like dining atmosphere restaurant is clean food is delicious atmosphere is busy but not loud for foreign visitor who can find this restaurant which is hidden in an ally you will not be disappointed, the owner speaks excellent english the food is outstanding but the best part is you can order 12 portions so you can try many dishes teapots with long spouts have to be seen in action to be believed, some of the best food in shanghai i especially loved their green beans eggplant kungpao chicken and their fascinating tea pouring, easily one of the best chinese meals available in shanghai a bit difficult to find as it is tucked away on a side street a must if you are a foodie a fusion of classical shanghai style dishes with the lesssweet more intense szechuwan style try the green beans pressed duck and anything else that catches your eye small sharing plates special green tea and the bananacoconut pancake style dessert is just too yummy for words, yummy fresh food no msg we had a selection of great dishes including eggplant and bean dishes that were delicious, the service was great rich menu great food tried sweet and sour pork and duck very yummy must try when in shanghai, so many people loved 1221 frankly i lived in china for 6 years and the food here was too greasy and not value for money all looked like upgraded street food version but prices are triple the deal perhaps the heaven for traveller or new citizen in shanghai to any senior who knows very well the chinese food i think you must agree with me, we had a fast but very good quality meal one of these days

service is fast and friendly the skin of the crispy duck second to none

vegetables nuts perfect

fair prices good international wine list, this was my 2nd visit to this restaurant nestled and hidden from the main road the food was lovely especially the spicy beef with bread the service was great with lovely ambience, i was in shanghai on business and my colleagues took me to this restaurant with which they were very familiar they did the ordering and we had several dishes to share from vegetables to fish to pot stickers everything was delicious the wait staff was very attentive, i have been several times within the last 3 years to this restaurant a lot of airline crews go there for dinner the chinese food is great and you will enjoy it if you are eg from europe the staff is very friendly and the prices are ok, weve been going to 1221 ever since our first week in shanghai 9 years ago the food is ridiculously good and made fresh without msg while a bit more pricey than other local food it is still significantly cheaper than other restaurants of this calibre great food great value great service when we have visitors to shanghai this is always on our list of restaurants, its customized for foreigners while some chinese foodies also consider it a good choice the service is quite friendly and lots of my foreign friends loved it from their first visit the tea there is also quite good there are also 12 off discount for workday lunch
its kind of hard to find the restaurant since its in the end of a side lane and the door of it is very low profile however you should be able to see the 1221 brand from the west yanan road sidewalk in the north of the road, a more western chinese restaurant great for groups the food just comes until you say no more we paid about <u+00a3>20 for a lot of foo and 3 beers each, 1221 dining room as it calls itself has been popular amongst the expatriates in shanghai for many years it has good decor wine glasses cutlery services and taste all designedmodified to appeal to expatriates especially westerners yesterday evening i had a group of 7 dining at 1221 with mixed comments amongst the food we had the curry beef brisket was a disappointment  with 23 left behind the rice liquor marinated pigeon appetiser was pitifully small and rather dry the tea smoked ducking was also a bit dry the prawns with garlic were actually served with shrimps the deepfried yellow crocker one tail each with head bone and tail was a delight and good companion for our wine the panfried bun with pork was excellent so was the deep fried sesame rice ball stuffed with red bean paste the green bean sprout stirfried with chinese rice liquor was delicious but the deep fried beans were too strongly flavoured yes we found its chef rather heavy and generous in dispensing salt sugar soy and seasoning the good side of this was it helped us to swallow quickly two bottles of red wine plus teas

byo corkage is charged at rmb50 per bottle reservation essential, enjoyed local shanghainese food at this restaurant tucked away down a laneway off the main yanan road west fan yu lu we dined with a local and he ordered some of the signature dishes  crispy deboned duck sliced egg plant the best eggplant i have ever eaten green beans beef tender even if you dont like egg plant try it lots of people dined the night we were there big groups of locals and non locals because its always busy and the food is good you are guaranteed fresh produce, used to come when i was working for my excompany that their shanghai office was closed to this restaurant this time a reunion with the excolleague i told him i want to come back here the restaurant is still the same with the waiter carrying a longmouth teapot and poured tea from a distance as the show the food is still good you can really get a shanghainese favor from this restaurant we ordered a whole fish and the nice western touch is they can remove all the bones when served yes even served in the whole fish the restaurant is crowded with foreigners and it is only thursday evening maybe memory is always better but the decor seems to be nicer before and it looks like now tables are more packed and with less privacy the service is friendly and the price is about right if you are looking for a local experience this may be too western for you though, visited as part of shanghai shopping tour the food was delicious excellent service  would definitely recommend
try the sweet and sour pork chicken and peanuts crispy duck eggplant and the spicy beef, more like a tourist place but recommendable
food and wine fulsome tasty and upmarket remarkable service, food is superb and the way they pour the tea water impressive
it is a version of local food that is somewhat modified to appeal to visitors but it does not mean any compromise to quality or taste one of my favourites in shanghai, i enjoyed this restaurant and it<u+00b4>s service food was great and prices are somehow fair
i recommend late booking between 9 and 930 pm as it gets very crowded at night especially between 600 and 830
i enjoyed the green tea with the red chili pepper and the way they serve it photo attached
make sure to try the spring rolls sauteed garlic shrimps and chicken in lemon sauce","steakhouse",0.809964012329545
82,"delicious thai food at least for westerners tastes big  tasty portions it was quite crowdy and we had to wait 45 minutes to get a table if accepted booking is strongly recommended, the food quality is superior than other thai restaurants that you can fin in town

its a bit expensive for be in shanghai but i suggest to have a try

and if you want also a little bis of sweet try they coconut sago and their mango sticky rice i will go back mano times

enjoy your meal and ask for a window table, good thai food in xintiandi maybe service could be better and also to understand that it is important to have the order in good time, went early at 4pm to avoid the lines by 5 pm people were lined up the decor inside is contemporary with thai accents for a nice ambiance i recommend the curry crab over the black pepper crab we had some spring rolls with spicy sweet and sour sauce a bottle of white wine a glass noodle shrimp salad black pepper steak on a bed of lettuce with vinegarette deep fried chicken wings and fresh mango with sticky polenta with sweet coconut milk sauce and yes the curry crab all of it was great with attentive service the xin tian di venue is a great setting for this fine restaurant, good location with easy access for the street

thai food is not 100 as has some chinese influence but very close

service was very good well priced with a good selection on the menu

worth a visit, the presentation for the papaya salad was amazing the food prices where very reasonable considering the location if you are wanting thai food it is a good place to go, good location when it comes to thai food just average nothing to write home about not sure but seems like they have no thai chef there just chinese so it shows on food quality average upscale fast food with price way above service is another issue i know it is very critical to save on labor cost our server was a trainee it was written on her shirt with big white letters no clue about food and no understanding about proper service very sad overall experience made me never come back although 4 years ago it was my favorite place for thai food, very good thai food
large variety traditional thai tastes
value for money absolutely ok

currently closed for renovation until early november, my colleagues and i had dinner in this nice restaurant in the amazing street of the long noses the way we western tourists are called here
great food we tasted beef my favourite being a kind of minced beef meat skewer chicken crab noodles fish coconut pudding discrete draught thai beer
an excellent funny dinner highly recommended, amazing authentic thai fresh ingredients very tasty good service reasonable prices pleasant surrounding and atmosphere we keep going back time after time unbeatable value, its a nice thai resto on a corner in xin tian di i go now 8y to this resto and is always nice only some times little crowded and thats reflecting on the service, the food is at best mediocre tastes not close to thai flavors the shrimp curry had very little flavor and the squid was blant the papaya salad lacked any spice and it was the most uninteresting salad we ever had service was good but they need to go to thailand for cooking lessons especially for the prices they charge, decent thai food better for lunch than for dinner quality is good has all the typical choices not a high end thai place but a great place for a quick comfortable bite to eat staff are friendly, we had an absolutely fantastic view of the skyline and light show of downtown shanghai the meal we had was a rice and pineapplescallion pick our party had various other items ranging from beef soup to rangoonand everything was done well i want to try this place again more locally to see how it compares to this one my hope is that the meals are as good here as there and that we can add another favorite to our restaurant list, we were here with 2 friends and decided to see how thai food was figuring well be eating chinese food enough as we were going to join a tour next day
food was good as was the service
however one of the reasons we stopped at this restaurant was an advertised dish on the board simply platter for 4 people we thought this was a good deal
however when we stated that we were ordering this dish as shown on the menu on the board in front we were told by the server that the board was old and the dish was no longer available at that price not sure if this is a deliberate bait and switch we ordered the dish anyway but it kinda left a feeling of being gypped
verify prices if they are on the board
good location food came fast, pros wide drink and food options great location in xin tian di food quality is good good value for the area pad thaisugar snap peaspork all good fast service

cons crowded space active not a fancy meal basic, restaurant is nice and easy to find causal thai dining but a little bit dimmer than expected good place for friends gathering with comfortable seats

average quality of food with a bit stronger and sweeter taste however good selections and sufficient choice in wine list which is unexpected in shanghai particularly in thai restaurant, go there last week they never had the pretentious to be a fancy restaurant in this time more thaifastfood for a reasonable price now still average qualityservice but a bit expensive, the thai foods here are very similar to those taken in thailand and i will say it value for the money we pay for to eat here, called in tonight with four friends  another brit and 3 chinese guys  and everything we ordered was tiptop we has tom yang soup  delicious and just hot enough followed by curried crab  green curry rice in a pineapple and some spicy noodles and it was all so well cooked and flavoursome
no hesitation in recommending, i come here almost every week with my husband as we love thai food and this place serve what we expect restaurant is almost always busy as its situated at a very strategic place good value for money i love the seafood tom yum soup  the appetizer plater in particular they use fresh ingredients which gives so much flavor staff speak basic english but are not too friendly there is an outdoor sitting and also indoor upstairs which is nice the lemon grass hot tea is simply amazing too once ordered food dont take too long to arrive which is a good thing they also have a wide variety of menu selection which is great, live in shanghai for 10 years and went to this restaurant many times in the past when it was ok i noticed many nice reviews on this restaurant i visit thailand frequently for business since 28 years and conclude that all these people have never ever been eating real thai food things have changed at simply thai no more thai chef and management now is chinese result as in january review skeggles from australia expensive bad chinese style nonthai food combined with bad service and a dirty toilet if the toilet is dirty you can guess what the kitchen looks like no more atmosphere as well plastic cups for drinks and a piece of paper with advertisement under your plate but you are charged full 10 service fee on top of the menu prices beef salad was served that did not even include one of the ingredients it should have like green onions lemon grass cilantro mint leaves lime juice fish sauce chili sauce and sugar it was just shandong beef and the managers explanation was that there are many ways to cook thai there is only one way of course and that is using the right ingredients and some decent cooking skills the name should be changed in we simply try, a nice place to get decent thai food with friends they have extensive menu and the waiting staff is friendly enough however need improvement with basic english, thai food is tasty huge selection and presentation is very good modern looking setting and cost is reasonable good place, a very good option for thai food in xintiandi prices are ok not that crazy expensive like some shops in xintiandi service is nice, i used to eat at the one on dongping road many years ago and never had a bad meal i visited this st last night for the first time with a colleague and we could not have enjoyed ourselves more we shared one appetizer and 3 mains and all were first rate in addition the place was packed with locals and westerners and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves i would surely go back based on my experience last night, simply thai is great place to dine in shanghai especially for asian restaurant and a lot of selection in thier menu great ambiance and nice service, i was in the area while visiting shanghai we fancy so thai food unfortunately nothing spectacular very average place our mango sticky rice was good but pad thai tasteless service not great very average also not will return, very good food for the price you pay they have lots of vegetarian and gluten free options too nice relaxing atmosphere good service and delicious curries

during my stay in shanghai i visited the restaurant multiple times for lunches and dinners very good experience, dont bother thai food chinese style is nit thai food there are much better and authentic places around in the same price range offering superior surroundings service and most importantly very good thai food, warm welcoming restaurant extensive food and drink menu very tasty food green and red curries excellent highly recommend, this restaurant is really good place with very nice food place is very big and there is a lot of stuff food is really nice fresh and good quality ingredients we had tom yum soup grean and read curry some meat and a salad with seafood and everything was delicious i recomend this place, good spot and always crowded the staff is friendly and the food is great spices that are used give you a good scent of thailand i recommend the spot, we were there on new years eve 20152016 and had a wonderful meal in a great environment specially considering that good chinese food is a little tricky for westerns being too spicy or hard to pick if you do not eat all kinds of meat it was a bit of a gourmet paradise for me in my trip to china with coconut water and everything if you live in brazil and are used to drinking it it is heaven to find, good thai style food in shanghai friendly service the clientele seems a bit hip but the food was satisfying, this restaurant is in a very very nice high end shopping area adjacent to 2 large malls the food is reasonably priced super authentic so delicious everything we had was fantastic, this is a tradition thai restaurant with thai cook and a long tradition in summer make sure you dine in the garden reserving your table is a good idea, on the 5th floor in a large shopping mall pretty decor good for small or large groups nice service the food was very authentic fish and shrimp cakes tum yum soup curries pad thai and lots of vegetarian choices for the most picky vegetarian highly recommend, we used to come quite often quick and constant however recently the quality has been a little poor the staff always need some managing and the order the food comes out is random that is normal for china soft shell crab is normally very good and the pineapple rice is good

upstairs is no smoking so you can escape the smell while you eat if your fancy european style thia food then well worth a visit, great restaurant for lunch or dinner the decoration is fabulous and food delicious price very honest super recommend trying, this is actually a pretty good spot i was craving thai food after being in shanghai for a few month the environment is great and as a foreigner this is located in a great hang out spot, went for an early dinner this evening and was not impressed with the food the green curry tasted as if it was laced with black pepper and lacked any thai flavour the lemongrass chicken was over cooked and tasteless one saving grass was the chicken coconut soup which was not bad but certainly not worth a special visit, i have been to simply thai located at hongmei lu several times and this was the first visit to the st in xin tian di  and it was just super everything from service to the food and its presentation was just wonderful i personally believe the chef here is better and i would rank this restaurant in the must try list when in shanghai, expensive and over rated there are now far better thai options in shanghai than this old standard quality of food is ok but should offer more for the price, traditional thai dishes simple decor great pictures of the menu speak english will come back family and kids friendly , as the title states this restaurant is worthy 

great food quality
reasonably priced
very accommodating staff amazing how they could handle the tables efficiently  we went for dinner and was a group of 11 people the restaurant was full and they really did well accommodating everyone

well done, we just dropped in for lunch one day and we were so surprised with the quality of food that we came back one week later for dinner first time there was no problem with a table second time we were lucky to get the last table available place was packed mostly with big groups of friends and families with kids it was a nice noisy busy place  both times we enjoyed good authentic thai food with best choices to be  crab in curry sauce a bit pricy but worth it rice fried with duck and really spicy papaya salad mixed at the table out choice for thai in xintiandi downtown shanghai area good for quick bite not a date or business meeting, simply thai has many branches throughout shanghai the food is ok nothing too exciting to rave about the decor is simple the taste is good portions are not big and the service needs to catch up to the price it charges, food taste is good price a bit high take sometimes for serving only a view english speaking waitress good thing menu in english, we had to find somewhere to eat relatively quickly as we had to make an 8 pm train in our case the service was ok not speedy but not slow i gave this restaurant a rating of three because it was a little expensive and the quality was good but not great we had thom ka gai coconut milk chicken soup pineapple rice and a broccoli vegetable dish the menu is similar for the most part to thai restaurants in california","Turkish cuisine",0.999692040405049
83,"we had passed many times in front of estado puro and last week we sided to try it the service was surprisingly friendly and attentive also it was quite fast so just because of this it made our day i shanghai usually service is ok but not friendly as people usually do not care much but at estado puro we really felt well treated
we ask the spanish special which brings a spanish omelette with chorizo  the chorizo was so soi think they need keep sourcing for a better one and the ensaladilla rusa was not ok perhaps too much veggies and make it look like a menestra con mayonesa the ham was pretty good we also had ham croquettes and were nice but not real ones as the bechamel sauce had mince meat
we had patatas bravas and were very nice for us the star dish was the ribs really delicious
definitely we will come back to try more dishes as the menu was quite interesting, amazing food amazing musicloved it
the waitress i dont remember her name was specially attentive
highly recommended not really expensive, love this place excellent service and even better food their staff are very knowledgeable about wines too you must try the croquettes

i have been here three times and will definitely be back for the cocktails, weve visited this restaurant  bar twice this week on the first occasion we had afternoon tea which was 158 rmb for 2 people and consisted of delicious sweet and savoury tapas dishes and included 2 glasses of sparkling white wine because we were hungry we also had a few extra tapas of anchoviesmeat balls and stuffed potatoes of various kinds the deserts were great too  apple pie and an orange flavoured creme anglais dishall very tasty and reasonably priced for the area the beer is a tad on the expensive side at over 80 rmb for a pint of stella but again its in keeping with other bars in this area

on our second visit we took friends visiting from the uk and ordered a selection of tapas with our wine and beer had another great experience and found the waiting staff to be very friendly attentive and helpful 1010 thank you guys for a great experience

i highly recommend this venue 

 i believe happy hour is on weekdays in the afternoon until 6 or 7pm where drinks are 12 price, very thin sliced tomatoes with olive oil and bread is a great combination with the iberico ham very attentive staff one of the better places in shanghai now bellotas is gone, in the centre of posh xintiandi village surrounded by luxury shops and expensive eateries this nice and quiet restaurant with clever and humorous decor offers authentic spanish dishes with surprisingly very affordable price great atmosphere and great food, happy hour with people watching the service was good so were the drinks the patio was comfortable happy hour prices cant be beat, this spanish restaurant located in xintiandi is becoming been my favorite place to enjoy a nice lunch dinner or afterwork moment in shanghai i loved the experience last times i have gone

im spanish and i must say the they let you feel you are at home all staffs were very attentive and take care all details and also the head chef came to check if we need anything


they have a varied menu and most of the tapas were pretty delicious each dish has layers of distinct flavors that compliment  build on top of each other it shows that the chef knows how to surprise you with every bite and take care about first impression with new creation everything was wellpresented and make the food look appetizing

love the special spanish paella jam croquettes and also the braised octopus with an original potatoes emulsion that let you really enjoy a soft and delicate flavor inside your mouth dont miss the desserts because they are very tasty and can blow you away

the size of the dishes were good enough for 2 or 3 people to have a few bite and price was not expensive consider the amazing location at one of most beautiful district of shanghai

i decide to come back again also to enjoy their evening happy hour with great and creative cocktails that the bartender create thoroughly
definitely i recommend this place to anyone looking for a bistro with good food service and a place to have a rest after a hard working day
worth it the visit, there are many excellent choices in xintiandi so everyone needs to be on their best each time very good meal and we enjoyed the staff and the restaurant have taken advantage of both the inside and outside seating outside is people watching on overload and great for having a drink inside the atmosphere is better for dining, the spanish food is fusion and nontraditional but very good for a change to what you normally eat at spanish restos jamon with patatas and pulpo were nice bacalao tacos were excellent nice place to have tapas with a few happy hour drinks, in the heart of xintiandi this place has some nice outside seating great for people watching while enjoying good food and good red wine, very nice place to start your afternoon or evening nice made coctails by mr jonathan really skilled  food is carefully prepared and they respect trational ingredient so you really eat what you want like you would get in spain good job guys keep it going and giorgio great manager , lovely location  ambience sit out in the open and enjoy the crowd with beer  snacks perfect place to spend an afternoon in a perfect setting mostly tourists in the area and hence language is no problem at all, as i came rather early in evening it was easy to get a place in this well frequented place in xintiandi i got really excellent food was served by very good staff only disappointment to me was that they could serve the famous estrella dam beer in magnum bottles but at least some simpler on of same brand, very good location in xintiandi cool place for an express lunch the set lunch was good but maybe they can change the dessert into something not very sweet the risotto was delicious outdoor patio is a good place to people watch ambiance is cozy recommended for nice lunch in this area, i have reviewed this place before and complained at that time about a few things  but i take it all back since i went there with a party of 10 and the service and food was great really great service was so efficient with a smile and the food cooked really well the wine was also really good and the atmosphere fun  i really recommend this restaurant for a big gathering definitely will go back  this is the same owners as the restaurant barbarossa in peoples park and they are both amazing for food and atmosphere, i had dinner here one evening and i was impressed with the food quality value for money and environment i highly recommend you pay this place a visit if you like spanish food bonus points for all of the food tasting fresh id say avoid the cheesecake in a glass though as its just a little bit of cheesecake goop and a huge blob of jelly i do recommend the chefs meatballs and the croquettes, this is a spanish type restaurant serving tapas and other food inside and outside seating is available the prices are a bit on the high side for what you get but the food was tasty alcohol is available id recommend sitting outside if the weather permits to enjoy the people watching, a good place to stop afterdinner for a drink or a light snack to watch the innpeople of shanghai good gintonics , a friend has recently relocated to shanghai and as we were there for the f1 we took the chance to meet up with him and he suggested this place

it is in a great location all very colonial and full of interesting bars restaurants and boutiques

the service was first rate and the food simply delicious we had a pile of stuff in the middle of the table and went for it we had one main dish a superbly cooked steak and a special mention to the iberico jamon  awesome flavour

we went back for lunch on the monday before our flight back just as well as the food at pvg lounge was awful and sqs not much better, very good food and pretty good wines beers and cocktails wide choice of tapas as well as dishes not cheap at all i would say pretty expensive, this restaurant is conveniently located within the french concession and has some very nice outdoor seating so that you can spend hours and hours people watching you can have a cup of coffeetea and get something nice to eat this place serves tapas westernized food and it caters exclusively to westerners thus when you go there youll be surrounded by other westerners so keep this in mind as it wont necessarily give you that experience of blending in and mingling with the chinese locals the food is great though and reasonably priced and it is a nice place to go and get a meal on the french concession to really experience it and what it is all about i would go again and i recommend sitting outside as this is what gives you that feel as if you were sitting outside at a caferestaurant in europe on a nice day just taking in the surroundings and the life going on around you, the food was great service was excellent and fast and an excellent experience in xitiandi the only downside is the somewhat expensive food and portions that leave you hungry, great food here the decor was outstanding prompt service the owner actually came by and was super helpful, expect to wait for tables on a weekend night for a coldwinter evening the outdoor seats were also occupied only planned to stay here for a drink but due to the attentive service we received from the beginning we decided to stay for 4 more rounds of drink thanks to the guy who took great care of us apologies for forgetting his name  he is the one from pakistan well done for the attentive and awesome service the price range of drinks is from 60110 rmb for a cocktail beer is totally expensive at 80 rmb for half a liter in xintiandi area this is already expected weve seen many people ordering food even late night we will definitely come back next time to try their dishes, as we had our last evening in shanghai for this weeks business trip we enjoyed the luxurious tapas of estado puro the day before the place was completely booked this day we were more early and could still pick our table the ambience and service are really nice with a elegant touch the interior is very welcoming and modern with humorous translations of spanish sayings besides the tapas we have enjoyed good beef and nice desserts a place to enjoy over and over again, good fellas is an excellent choice when visiting shanghia the is ideal just off the bund i enjoyed their wine selection an tapas and paella there is staff finally name sumon  i would recommend this for a nice nights out business dinner or any on food in shanghai, decided to try this on a whim as we were in the neighborhood and they had a set meal available basically from rmb58128 you can choose the main course with comes with a fixed appetizer dessert and coffeetea

choice was limited but food was decent i would recommend the risotto

service wise though left much to be desired we were served by a youngish lady who seemed to have woken up on the wrong side of the bed our questions were answered curtly and rather sarcastically and i did not see her smile even once during the whole duration we were there

there were writings on the wall which translated some spanish terms refer to the picture i took which basically seemed to spell out the motto of the place

1 its not a good moment
2 i dont care
3 the bill, located in the heart of economic district in shxintiandi the estado puro by poco roncero is a very good place to spend an high quality of international drinks and also to eat spanish great dishes born by the famous chef owner of this clubrestaurant
ill back for sure in this place when i back to sh, actually it was a very late breakfast on new years day very friendly welcome in this nice and comfortable place we selected one tapas from the main menu and 2 brunch dishes which are reasonably priced tapas of grilled octopus disks with a potato dip wow so tasty perfect eggs benedict and tris with bruschetta frittata and potato salad two very nice brunch plates wine i think is overpriced with the current exchange rate it should be possible to offer wines from <u+00a5>200 a bottle from spain but hey if money is no concern then why not go for a tempranillo at 688 excellent espresso a great start of the new year, the tapas are fairly good nothing special but very decent grub the vibe and music they play is fantastic and a great way to unwind after a hard day the pick of the xintiandi restaurants for me if you are also looking for something upbeat, we arrived here at 830pm on a tuesday night it was very quiet so we had no problem getting a table without a reservation nice trendy place with a good choice of drinks and cocktails live music also we ordered five dishes between two of us and it as just the right amount all of it was excellent and nicely presented the service could not be faulted  a great place to visit if in xintandi we will be back on our next visit, this place has a bar atmospher music and a little smoky especially towards the front we were not expecting mush from the food but were pleasantly surprised the tapas was good cocktails were reasonable great place to eat with friend before a few drinks, this place is in a good location and the atmosphere is great service though is very slow and they seemed not to get the order right everything we ordered didnt come and we go totally different food  when we sent it back they were not so happy service was so so slow this restaurant has a sister restaurant called barberoza and this is so much better when our food finally arrived it was quite nice but the service out me off, we came here looking around in the xintiandi section of shanghai for a more european restaurant after one week of only chinese restaurants the place was pretty crowded but the friendly waiter got us a free table quickly he also gave us some good recommendations about the tapas selection the menu in general and the wines to go along with it the douro wine he recommended was great as were the tapas some of us had the paella which was great with a nice crust at the bottom and fresh seafood i had the steak which was ok but not great for its price
downside very loud music which was adjusted a bit towards the end and well not exactly the cheapest place , we went there for a late dinner and it was crowded amazing atmosphere good assortments of tapas and wines and also a nice presentation of the tapas
looking for a typical spanish tapas restaurant then you are in the perfect spot
oh and their amazing cocktails, estado puro shanghai is a casual spanish tapas place in xintiandi section of shanghai the chef who started this casual chain is named roncero he is famous in espana if you are in the mood for a change of pace from chinese delicacies than this is a great choice the menu is traditional tapas with some degree of local variation this place is very crowded and popular so it must be doing many things right there is a dj at certain times please do not think this is tapas in el born barcelona even though there is a sister restaurant in madrid spain have an open mind and enjoy in a lovely setting xie xie, had the spanish beer for the first time the waitress call it spanish new star beer nice light and sweet easy to drink

the restaurant is cosy and will be better if they can tone down the music had to shout to each other across the table

oh they should not allow smokers inside the restaurant with the weak air con and poor ventilation the place gets smoky and uncomfortable when its gets crowded, really nice and very tasty tapas and wine its a bustling place with very good service and a good choice of music making it a perfect place to go out my only comment is the prices are very high, i was there a few nights for dinner and i can say quality and service are there
wonderful food tapas and more anchovies ham croquette iberico
live music all to spend a great night, best tapas ive ever eaten live music wonderful local and hear spanish in shanghai refreshes your spirit, i had a lovely business lunch here with a few choices from the menu the nicely designed space the menus were easy to follow designed well and had a lot of interesting things to try the staff were nice and the people watching was great, i ate here solo and just adored this restaurant the outdoor ambiance is lovely and they had very endearing live spanish music � a guitarist who also sang being vegetarian i found the menu quite friendly the spanish omelette with potatoes was surprisingly good and the fresh salads were great as well the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream was very delicious and a nice small portion for a solo diner i have to say this was a lovely evening dining at this place and you wont be disappointed if youre looking to relax in xintiandi enjoy the sights and sounds eat good food and escape the hustle and bustle of china � if even for a moment, this restaurant its an allaround in flavor and quality everything is delicious real spanish food
if you are a big eater as i am get ready to take out your wallet since this place is not cheap at all but i can understand that the place is located in a hot spot and they deliver premium ingredients so its more than justified
will i come back again certainly yes its a safe and delicious bet, relax the spanish way they offer an early dinner with some tapas and in month with an r a plate of perfect oysters complete all with a spanish beer or wine and you dont feel to be in china anymore
if the weather is nice  i was lucky  sit outside and watch all the tourists passing and watching you and enjoy the really great tapas, a contemporary tapas restaurant in trendy xintiandi we loved sitting in the oudoor area people watching and sipping our crispy pinot the tapas menu is very modern with some traditional tapas being deconstructed and an extensive jamon options
a bit pricey but it is xintiandi after all and if you go between 530 and 730 you can enjoy the happy hour staff is very friendly and efficient we had garlic prawns potato combo and mushrooms with manchego cheese, everything you need for just a nice evening cosy location friendly and professional staff excellent food and great music all of this at a reasonable price in a trendy neighborhood of shanghai discovered by coincidence but turned out as a nice surprise the tapas were fresh well prepared and nicely presented
congratulations to the team for so much dedication in what looks just a standard tapas restaurant but who offers just that little more to be really good, went for tapas it was delicious had a wonderful spanish wine to accompany the food also their drinks a must try is their tiramisu martini either before or after dinner estado puro is a great place to bring a date or your friends for a good meal, if you want to enjoy great surroundings  a really cleverly designed barinformal restaurant atmosphere in the centre of xintiandi  shanghai  then look no further

the bar area has beautiful lighting and the the staff really accommodating  including an englishman who has his finger on the pulse with excellent knowledge of the spanish food and wines the malbec was excellent 

the menu is attractive in its outlook  easy to navigate and the chilli prawns were outstanding as was the cold tuna with guatemala  mmmmh  fresh and delicious  the spanish chef has a perfect feel for quality and flavour value for money  a most definite yes 

its a must for tapas fiends but if you just want to drink or have a coffee and watch the world go by then sit outside and relax as the busy people move through the xintiandi area, imagine enjoying a chilled bottle of bollinger champagne sitting on the patio on a pleasant day in the french quarter of shanghai what could be better other than a beautiful woman as company delicious and well presented food and helpful service that was my lunch at estado puro in shanghai we began with a plate of iberico cold cuts  and they were the best cold cuts we have had in china very tasty and wonderful flavors that was followed for me with a tuna tartar served on an avocado base and delightfully spiced my guest the beautiful woman had a spinach salad which was fresh and tasty the mains were a halibut and beef short rib the halibut was wonderfully prepared and served on a bed of vegetables the beef rib was a plate fred flintstone would be proud of however its true benefit was not size but the slow cooking process had made the meat so delicious and it melted in your mouth of course the bollinger was predictably awesome overall a great location for a great lunch and a wonderful memory of shanghai","dumpling restaurant",0.639773914526914
84,"boxing cat is a micro brewery that has a few locations around shanghai good food and good beer they also have great lunch specials since i live in shanghai i eat here often the boxing cat chain i think was just acquired by inbev the largest brewery in the world so that tells you they are doing things right, the place has home brewed beers on the menu these are excellent the food is us southern comfort type and i didnt find it very good stick to the beer with some fingerfood, nice bar serving burgers and great beer good to sit by the fireplace on a cold day on wednesdays the second burger is free they could do with a curtain at the door to keep out the cold, it may seem an evening place but this serves really good breakfast i had the breakfast burrito which was really good and huge its good for sharing

service was good staff can speak english and give suggestions, came for the blackened fish tacos excellent had them last year when in shanghai but opted for the special tonight pepper encrusted tuna and cesar salad
surprising very good one critical comment would be it needed a little more of the sauce dots as they were excellent and spicy and the lentils needed a bit of help in that regard however the pepper encrusted tuna was excellent good cut and prepared rare as requested maybe i should not say surprised as this is my third visit here came for the brews and the food has always been very good exceeding my expectations which is always good, i have been at both branches of boxing cat both on fuxing road the home brewed beers are good every thursday evening there is drink as much as you can for 2 hours for just 100 cny food is the usual pub grub average quality, the location was far from our hotel so it took us a while to get there there were no local people very western bar the beer was pretty good the food was ok dont ask the waitress to get you a taxi they charge a commission on top of the taxi price and the price they quoted was not correct we were told us prior to getting in the taxi the cost was 39 and midway through the ride the taxi driver showed us the meter which was over 60 plus the 7 commission for the restaurant, have been there numerous times the best day to visit is monday beer is 12 price food is solid texmex cuisine to my surprise they are able to maintain good and consistent food quality over long time beer selection is good taking in consideration that it is micro brewery nice ambience busy all times not easy to get sits outside non smoking inside good place to spend time with friends over couple beers, its expensive but the quality of the food is really good and as one would expect there is a wide offering of beer

service was very slow

comfortable place to spend a few hours of an evening, i have been to the bc several times as i live in the shanghai area they are part of the quickly emerging craft beer movement in shanghai i go for the beer the taps are always changing with my favorite being the standing 8 pilsner the menu is western targeted with burgers sliders and cajun dishes they also offer eggs benedict over short ribs on the weekend brunch menu the beer is not cheap usually 50 rmbglass so look for the posted happy hours the staff seems to change a lot 3 managers in 3 years but be patient point at the menu and you will get your request in short order, great beer selection liked the ambience enjoyed my chicken wings and other peoples food looked good its all about the beer though i had too much, this is a very nice intimate bar restaurant with a friendly staff and great service

the food was very good american fare the bbq pulled pork sliders are awesome good friesthick steak cut style the nachos were piled high smothered in chili peppers cheese delicious

great craft beer selection too

seats at the bar are comfortable and there are couches and tables around the bar very comfortable place to hang out, i really felt i was in the uk when i entered this place
i did enjoyed the brews the food and the pool table on the second floor of the pub
its located near to some night clubs so its also nice to stop by to have a nice brew before drinking some vodka
met lots of local people not much foreigners also it was a bit empty by the time i arrived there it was like midnight at friday or saturday
anyway a very nice place to go, i was here with my bro is a nice quiet and cool place if you wanna chill and drink a couple of beers
good burgers nice staff cool beers thats it, nice place for a group if you are more focused on the drinksfriends sort of night out food was ok but nothing special staff were pleasant, there are 3 boxing cat locations but i like this one the best i really am not into the loud bar scene and like a slightly more mature crowd so this is the location for me they have two floors so there is room for larger parties upsatairs as well as two seater high and low top tables tucked into some corners on the first floor on nice nights sit out front or in the court yard for a more cozy environment or even by the fireplace for a more romantic setting their own house brand brew is excellent and they have no problem giving you a short taste sample the food is incredibly outstanding and is a crossover fusion of american southern and southwest  this food has real flair and flavor not the standard texmex spicy hot sauce stuff with no soul but real chef quality culinary cusine in an upscaled pub setting the service is very quick and they have never made an error on my order the pricing is slightly higher than the average pub fare but this is way above average food i highly recommend the bbq ribs and mac and cheese but everything ive ordered from appetizers to burgers to ribs has been great you can call ahead and make reservations but on friday and saturday dont expect them to hold the space if you are late, 10 minute walk from either changshu rd line 7 or shanghai library line 10 microbrews reminiscent of home and betterthanbar food to go with it they sell metric growlers too, nice place to eat drink and rest during a day trip in the sinan mansions village
enjoy a cold boxing cat beer while have fun with friends, i live close to this boxing cat location and go here frequently they make excellent beer and rotate them frequently quality of food is also very good and a step up from the standard pub fare served at shanghai brewery, another american style restaurant in china however crafted beer is good order the six sample tasting its worth it, now i have been here before and it was ok but this time i was not impressed at all we went for brunch and the food and service was terrible  we could not get any service and had to keep searching for the waiterwaitress each time we needed help the food tasted like canteen food meaning like slop normally the food here is quite good but this time i dont know what has changed but it was awful there are a lot of new places opening around the same area and i am sorry to say next time ill try those instead not because of the food but because of the service its self , this is an all around great place to chill out with friends enjoy some nice food and craft beer on tap

a winner, with my husband and i being from san diego  we love our craft beer so we were excited to hear about this brewery while we were in china i loved being able to try craft beer in china and i enjoyed the beer sampler so i could try all 6 original boxing cat beers they did not disappoint i also ordered the sliders which were pretty tasty my husband and i also picked up two souvenior shirts from here donkey punch porter and tko ipa which we love wearing to remind us of our trip and enjoying craft beer around the world, always good beer and good food a great standby for expats in shanghai this location is smaller than most boxing cats but cozy a great place to unwind after a stressful day great service, the beer here is just ok im no expert but i brew beer from grain only no shortcuts so i know a bit about it pretty standard offerings pale ale ipa wheat porter and the 2 i tried were unremarkable the logo and website for this place looked witty and interesting but once you�re inside it�s more of a fight club vibe with ufc fights surrounding you on multiple screens i was looking for a souvenir shirt just about all pretty kitschy with beer style themed with boxing left hook this and uppercut that but none of the shirts had the location � shanghai so what�s the point if you�re into ok standard fare beer and a heavy fighting theme this place is for you, lovely place to sit outdoors and work your way through the menu of homebrewed beers good selection of wine for nonbeer drinkers a great pint , very nice outting that place the deco is trendy yet not too art museum like and the pub is well equipped the beer selection is perfect and you will find a hit for each of you
only down side is the staff is a bit dull and poorly capable of expressing any coherent english so dont expect rebuilding the great wall of china with the barman it will be a sad monologue
the quarter is nice and posh making the rent high and subsequently the beer expensive but you want nice company and you will find it
great for casual business outtings, cool location seats outside available to the street i really enjoyed the 4 beer sampler combo and sweet potato fries as a snack i would come back, boxing cat makes it own beer and its really good had few pints ive tried some ipas and the barleywine all very good got some chicken and waffles to eat very pleased with them it was the closest thing ive gotten to a western meal during my stay in china, when in town one must visit this place although the name doesnt really work the boutique beer concept is a refreshing change to the usual shanghai pub grub scene
great beers cold also which can be a rarity in china and very good food which can be ordered as shares which works well the strength of the beers also vary greatly so you can go light and blonde or dark and heavy
although the name of the place is pretty silly the quality is exceptional, after a long hot walk what could be better than a beer two beers we live in montana and have a craft brewery on most every corner so we know and appreciate a good brew we had great beer with cool atmosphere what more could we ask for
this is a great stop as you walk through the former french concession , great local brewery with good food and nice ambiance they all are different between the locations same great beer but different items on the menu and the setup is different, boxing cat advertised a leprechaun beer on their website i came here to check it out it wasnt available and after discussion with the wait staff they didnt seem to care at all not even willing to offer a substitute beer for the same price this place is a joke, we saw the flyers about st patricks day extravaganza and decided to celebrate it there

we walked in about 19ish and it was pretty empty somehow when trying to order on the happy our list they said it wasnt possible didnt get a good explanation why well you seldom do we did not get a free sampler as specified in the flyer if you were wearing green

as it was pretty empty in the bar not any extravaganza going on we got a table and had dinner i had the meatballs with tomato sauce and spaghetti not impressed at all tomato sauce was ok spaghetti i guess was supposed to be al dente but was just hard the meatballs not impressive my friends had burgers and they were normal pub burgers
the food came quickly and we ate and left the non existing extravaganza as they have nice beers this could be a place to come back to when its possible to sit outside otherwise its nothing special, great place to stop in for a few beers beer is great atmosphere inside is rustic and has a nice vibe lots of expats in the area and in the bar, ive been going to boxing cat since it was out in minhang 8 years ago i now pretty much starve when i go there because they have taken off all salads from their menu so the only vegetarian options are all high carb fatty foods there is only one vegetarian sandwich they got rid of the veggie burger which was awful anyways and it is a huge deep fried eggplant parm wedge between two gigantic pieces of ciabatta bread its a heart attack waiting to happen comes with fries because they no longer have salads please boxing cat get with the program and offer some healthy options love the beer and service just not the menu, the brewskies are really good the ipa is world class i dont think drinking tsingtao for a week clouded my judgement the atmosphere is nice and the first floor has a cozy feel to it the food is pub grub burgers wings quesadillas you get the drift surprisingly enough for a place with foreigners as their main clientele the staff had limited english and limited experience of waitressing quirky but in a way charming service, my wife and i came here while visiting shanghai to quaff a couple microbrews and get some work done on the internet the beers were terrific i had the imperial stout my wife had the ipa it looks like they have a new bottled imperial porter but we didnt give that a try fixing is a gorgeous street so the walk from the metro station was a pleasure true to the other buildings in the area this one is a lovely old colonial we left earlier than wed wanted because no employee in the place knew the right password for the wifi oh well guess thats what international data plans are for right, the food looks great on the menu its not bad but nothing that made me want to go back the service was pitiful you have to beg for service and attention from the staff when you want to order the good side is the outside seating is great for good weather, generally good american fast food like burgers and wings but staff another story seems they dont know difference between well done and rare or medium rare served buffalo wings inside dripping with red blood more than once guess it goes from freezer to hot oil nachos not as big or tasty as shanghai brewery brunch ok but tends to get crowded, food and atmosphere is consistent english pub atmosphere is nice staff service is soso its worth trying, been at boxing cat several times and i never been disappointed best beers in town and really good food for a good price can highly recommend their pulled pork together with a tko ipa, i very rarely crave restaurant food its not often that the food is memorable enough for me to want to go back some vague memory of boxing cat brewery enticed me back into the brewpub this week and while i came for the beer i walked out a complete slave to their bread n butter fried chicken sandwich this was the best fried chicken sandwich i�ve ever had anywhere

instead of the typical bread that accompanies any meal the waitress brought me two pieces of grilled cornbread with chive butter sweet crunchy a little salty and grilled to perfection the perfect accompaniment to the boxing cat tko ipa the sandwich when it arrived was about 3 inches high sitting on an incredibly delicious buttermilk bun with thinly sliced halfsour dills the moist chicken thigh was covered with an amazing crispy crackly buttermilk coating if i weren�t watching my waistline i would have ordered seconds

with all the restaurant choices in shanghai i hate to return to the same place more than once or twice but i�m compelled i�ll be back again, i tried three different beers all were goodexcellent i also had dinner and tried a burger which was excellent with really good beef highly recommend this place for a bite and drinks, +++if you appreciate beer and are in china this is the place to go taste the best beer china
++music playlist was nice and atmosphere even more nice
+nice staff with good english
 didnt explore the food menu too much
 they should start bottling their beer shame the beer is only available in the tap, because i work for a boxing goods company my friend who lives in shanghai thought it would be funny to meet me at the boxing cat brewery we met there on a sunday night at around 9pm place was half emptied it has a good crowd early 30s and up young professional crowd which is nice if you want to just listen to music and have an audible conversation with friends the beers are not cheap but they are delicious and every beer on the menu are made by them i didnt eat here so i cant tell how the food is but my friend recommends it, we watched tv had nice beer in a nice environment

stuff was friendly and very young

the pub serves different kinds of beer, we walked here from langham hotel xintandi which took us about 20 minutes on our way to visit the former residence of he xiangning  it is located in sinan mansions with some nice shops bars and restaurants there is outdoor seating and seating over three stories good food american style and excellent beers which change on a regular basis, a good range of local beers a few reasonable ciders on the menu seasonally the food here is american style but very poor not traditional pub food if you are british if you want a beer and a place with a sports bar feel then this is pretty good, a few outdoor tables inside is multiple levels for enjoying beers and food the beers on tap are always changing and local brews the seating is comfortable and grouped nicely food is american style so it is a tad expensive good music and crowd was enjoyable","Taiwanese cuisine",0.851895340066653
85,"i know it does without saying that you get what you pay for in terms of quality i have been going to china for the last 8 years and this hotel outshines them all a proper 5 star with rooms that look like they are brand new clean and plenty of space i ended up in a suite with more space than o knew what to do with

heavenly bad was great as is always wherever you go and the bathroom with the large rain shower perfect with private storage area for your bags so they not cluttering the room

the only downside was the view i expected it to be of the skyline and it was more to the side of the building nit picking a little

the hotel is an easy walking distance to the bund to see the sky line yu gardens and the temple as well as nanjing road for some harassment and shopping

definitely will be back here and do recommend this to others, this hotel is really a good one as a multi destination traveler i spend almost 8 to 9 months a year travelling i enjoyed my stay in this property in shanghai last june, you must go to the seafood buffet or the sunday brunch both have amazing food sunday brunch has wonderful entertainment from locals or nearby countries, we have been there group of friends and enjoy the food and vines  good service  nice taste  recommended price ore a bit high  but it deserve for such service and location, westin has one of the best brunches in the world if not in the universe imagine four hours of free flow of taitinger a free bar and all the food you can think of start with fake caviar and continue to see food steaks goose liver indianitalian chinese chicken in all shapes deserts and more and more you cant taste everything there is just no time the quality is not on top of everything but more then ok the value of money is enormous the brunch on westin was one of the best four hours in shanghai but dont plan anything afterwards taitinger and the free bar takes its toll, i have not been to the westin bund center for a few years and it looks almost the same the suites are nice with good size living room area everything seems to work fine and their service is good it is also within walking distance to the bund and very close to nanjing road east subway station i would come back again be warned that their breakfast is very expensive but there is a pacific coffee out front that you can get coffee and breakfast cheap, want to have an excellent brunch on sunday  the westin offers one of the best with buffet style lay out food from all over the world everyone can be pleased with or without the alcohol option free flow champagne cocktails and wines are in the alcohol included option children from 4 to 12 pay half price younger are free over 12 pay full price
during the brunch from1130 to 1430 a diverse set of performances including some impressive opera singing will be happening
the place to go for a sunday late morning and get some great food in excellent settings , very comfortable hotel with very helpful staff we looked forward to returning at the end of the day of exploring and sightseeing as it was like a home away from home, what can i sayso much to choose from you can pick your own fish to be cooked how you would like it the breakfast buffet is also great offering chinese and western foods it had a wide variety of pastries and has many stations not that close together so never a line the restaurant manager  i forgot wis name but it starts with mi was very helpful in telling me translations and picking out different dishes super delicious fresh dishes, the buffet spread here is amazing with a split of old and new food and even indian food amazing however at the same time the quality of the food is more middle range as opposed to high range enjoyed the breakfast compared to a lot of the chinese hotels but not top class  as in believe more preserved food bacon sausages etc, i recently went here in a party of 9 for sunday brunch the price is 588 ++ for brunch including the alcohol package the food was excellent the selection and quality could not be faulted it was very busy so booking in advance would be advisable i paid half price for my 5 year old who ate 3 chicken nuggets and 2 candyfloss so it worked out a little expensive for him
this is not something i would do every week as for a family of 4 it works out very expensive but for a treat it was great
there was a high number of expats here and the food was geared appropriately, my family me hubby and 2 daughters 7 and 10 went for mothers day brunch and it was wonderful
not only are there plenty of food options for everyone but also great entertainment
its from 1130230 and you should expect to say the whole time

we enjoyed all types of cuisine my husband particularly enjoyed the lobster and crab legs
my kids enjoyed all the desserts  i didnt think they were as yummy as they looked though
my main culinary appointment was the mexican station their guac was straight up gross it was too bad 

other than that the entertainment for the last section was wonderful
my 7 year old missed most of it thought because she was in the kids club upstairs playing there, we joined their sunday brunch  it was all fabulous everything was fresh and plenty even champagne was unlimited one of the best brunches together with sangrilas which we also visited previously, hotel is well appointed and maintained great buffet breakfast with offerings from eastern and western cultures my only complaint is the consistantly undercooked bacon, great choices there is something for everyone we ate here several times and were never disappointed, most likely the best brunch in shanghai
we have tried all the major bunches in the city while every brunch has its ups and downs the westin seems to have the best overall selection of food the service was very attentive the glasses were refilled without asking for it there was always someone having an eye on our table
the music and performance were very entertaining
if i had to find something negativewhy didnt they let us take the balloons for the kids serving champagne free flow but then being stingy on the balloons for the kids no go
this is still a full score for the westin i strongly recommend it for familys or anyone else who wants to treat himself, westin offered a great variety of food and dishes nice classical music the music was at times a bit too loud for our taste though and relaxed atmosphere

desert table was a letdown asians cant seem to be able to cook tasteful deserts not sure why as was the service  nobody bothered to collect dirty plates or glasses which we find totally unacceptable for a brunch this expensive

we do not regret the experience but the bruch is not worth the price compared to ritzcarlton brunch in singapore westin is lagging behind especially in service and deserts, westin was a great buffet lunch choice during the week the place was reasonably busy but there were always enough very professional and friendly waitstaff around our table was always cleared when needed the dishes were a good variety and very very fresh deserts for those who could still manage were extensive and there was also some fruits the mixed fruit salad could have been better but all the other dishes were very nice the cost per adult without alcohol was very reasonable certainly more competitive than all the other 5 star hotel buffets weve visited in shanghai recently recommend a visit, nice place festive good staff nice bites great drink esp the cocktails and prosecco less great things teabags in china it already is expensive no need to add on an extra service charge just add it on drink prices now it is a bit offensive, + great champagne sunday brunch
+ booking ahead is a must
+ good ambience
+ efficient service
+ delicious brunch selection that leaves nothing to be desired with plenty of food indian thai chinese italian lobster salads desserts etc etc �
+ champagne free flow was great
+ enjoyed the opera extracts performed live and they also had the other performances are more around circusbalancing 

over all a big high end brunch and a perfect sunday experience a bit expensive but well worth it, stayed one night ate great food at italian restaraunt room was of five star standard minisuite king size bed large and long bath separate shower room with kingsize powerful shower and wc

as in much of the far east when you stay at five star locations you get the service you paid for it is the very best and just as the hotel is luxury so is the quality of food had great fitness area with modern cybex equipment good size lap pool very close to the bund so great location, great selection of food everything you could want and fun acts to watch if you are in any way bored with eating acrobatics singing clowns hat dance
we sat on second floor which to be honest was better for us away from the hustle and bustle of people getting their food
quite expensive but if you are in a very hungry mood you may be able to get value for money
my only reservation is the hotel lobby feeling after all the brunch is served in a large hotel lobby its not bad just not cosy
book early it gets pretty busy starts at 1130 with welcome drinks, been to many restaurants around the world and had my share of brunch this is without doubt the most overwhelming here is everything fish seafood caviar oysters teppanyaki chinese japanese italian giant dessert area complimentary champagne beer cocktails  and it just goes on everything you can imagine and more seemed a bit pricy but now knowing what it contains it worth it quality is excellent everything is clean and fresh staff very professional polite and english speaking even a string ensemble chinese circus artists and opera singers for your entertainment what<u+00b4>s not to like , we had a couple of breakfast meals  one dinner at the westin bund ctr the selection is staggering and well displayed the seating  table service is very nice i would definitely recommend a visit, the lunch buffet has it all a great variety of food chinese western seafood and great desertsexcellent service excellent facilities and surroundings, my kids just love the sunday brunch and so do i westin is very good for children they have playroom and entertainment during the brunch

the food is getting better compared to one year ago a must for visitors to try the champagne brunch, stayed for a couple of nights comedy of errors on check in they couldnt find my booking after a red eye flight this was frustrating check out was also a problem receptionist had taken my credit card and couldnt find it she inisted i hadnt given it to her finally found it after she realised she had placed it on a black surface was unimpressed with her defensive stance and that was equally frustrating as i was rushing to catch a flight rooms were a little old looking but not unexpected considering how old this hotel isservice does need to be improved, i enjoyed my stay here for business staff is professional rooms are spotless and bed is great towels and refreshments are available at reception counter as is a nice touch, what a great selection from meat dishes fish courses and vegetarian options clear and easy to follow together with a varied selection of drinks both soft and alcoholic the staff will accommodate any reasonable request once finished you can walk off the mountain of food that you have had with a stroll along the bund, went there today amazing brunch now eight hours later my two kids are stomach sick and throwing up if you dare please go there and maybe you get your vacationbuisness trip destroyed, our stay at the westin bund center was perfect we were upgraded to an executive suite and had a fantastic view of the bund from our bed the room was incredibly spacious and the bathroom was perfect we appreciated the attention to detail by the staff the free water bottles around the hotel and the cleanliness

we enjoyed breakfast in the executive lounge as well as the snacks in the afternoon the spread in the executive lounge was small and often quite a bit of chinese foodhowever the atmosphere was quiet and perfect for getting work done we also went to the larger buffet downstairs and loved it there was a huge variety of chinese and western food available for breakfast again the staff were lovely and so helpful

we so appreciated how kind and helpful the staff were their english was also fairly proficient it is very apparent that the staff have been trained well compared to the other hotel we stayed at in shanghai, i am most impressed with their oyster bar where fresh oysters are opened while you wait the most important fact is every single one i had  about a dozen  was fresh and good thats rare to find in a buffet the seafood grill area was attractive where you can pick the fish shrimp or clams and chefs will prepare it anyway you like but unfortunately the fish was not fresh at all we tried 2 different style of fish and both were very fishy and not fresh at all rest of the food selections were limited and nothing too exciting worth mentioning, stayed in this hotel twice on spg points no meals were included so we ordered food a la carte we ate there at least 5 times because we ordered a la carte there was a longer time to waitwe came to understand and plan around that, this 5 star hotel exceeded all of our expectations we were delayed several hours because of disembarkation issues with the quantum of the seas we were expecting a company to pick up some luggage we were shipping back to the us we could not reach that company so we sent a note to the hotel the consierge handled the notification and arranged a pickup for the next day our room was incredible complete with a huge shower a separate toilet area and a fantastic bath tub our view from the floor to ceiling windows was spectacular the climate controlled worked  all night the included breakfast had around the world choices this hotel was an incredible start to a fabulous china vacation, great champagne brunch freeflow of tattinger plenty of choices for vegetarians friendly staff entertaining program book table in advance from the 1st floor, fantastic hotel placed right in the centre of city with great connectivity  lotus rooftop gives a brilliant view of the skyline of this old turned modern city accessible to all shopping areas nightlife restaurants and huge public places staff is helpful and courteous  the breakfast spread is for everyone so wont be disappointed, we had a lunch last friday  food  service ambiance was superb price is exceptional definetely you will enjoy highly recommended  in advance make a reservation, if you are not stay in the hotel i suggest to go anywhere else theres plenty of restaurant on the bund can walk by
except the expensive brunch at 600+ per person they were not able to provide a good menu with continental food for dinner staffs are not well trained according to luxury hotel standard, we had lunch in the stage restaurant at the westin bund centre in shanghai the service was over the top the restaurant manager came by to make sure we were well cared for especially due to my wifes gluten free needs the restaurant was very attentive to her needs and the food was delicious finally back in shanghai we found some good wines and enjoyed a champagne during our lunch the caeser salad was really well prepared my wife had burger and it was served with gluten free bread the servers were top rate we had an excellent and relaxing time and will come again, the food spread is incredible and if you love champagne they have the best pairings with caviar oysters seafood sashimi chocolates etc totally worth the money considering freeflow of champagne option and the sunday brunch comes with a cultural show which is great for entertaining visitors to shanghai, we had brunch here with friends table reserved a few weeks in advance sat in the atrium with good view of the band playing classical music on second floor including opera pieces and the show in the center with acrobats brunch selection leaves nothing to be desired with plenty of food indian thai chinese italianlobster meat sweets like ice cream waffles crepes you make it champagne free flow it was a bit over 600rmb pp but well worth it especially with the sunlight streaming through the glass roof making it a perfect sunday experience, sumday brunch of westin is really one of the visits you cannot miss in shanghai brunch is good with a lot of different kind of food many countries involved however this is not the best best is clearly the libe music and opera which a natural light environment which make the brunch really enjoyable, my husband and i stayed 5 nights at the hotel and had a fantastic experience we stayed in the grand studio room and it was spacious comfortable and well decorated i enjoyed the integrated tv in the bathroom in addition the hotel has one of the largest hotel fitness facilities ive ever seen 2 floors with separate cardio weights and yoga  pilates rooms a heated pool as well as 2 hot tubs a steam room and a sauna in the change room the staff we interacted with were also friendly lastly i have to compliment the hotel on providing the best shanghai tourist map ive ever seen ive stayed at a variety of hotels in shanghai and this has definitely been my best experience, nice hotel free upgrade my room with nice viewvery kind staffs i am platinum member in starwood they recognize me upon check ini must say facilities sitll not good need renovate even this is quite new hotel compare with other sheratons in shanghaifor the food breakfast is terrible need update the menu add much more japanese dishedfor the aircon i called to guest center to check the room aircon since my room is so cold all the recepionist did a good job nicely welcome me upon check in finally engineer helped me to fix it really fast response nice hotel, not sure why you would want to go unless staying in the hotel nothing really to offer a traveller unless you really want to pig out on the sunday brunch here, this is my 5th or 6th time staying a this hotel and its just a wonderful oasis
the people are happy and helpful and the breakfast keeps me going all day
dont even need the business the regular experience is that good

location near the bund always perfect, our favourite brunch topping singapore london and others while very pricey you can drop the champagne and opt for regular drinks only you are guaranteed to overeat as the presentation and ramge of food is eclectic so plan for a lot of walking in the afternoon booking ahead several days in advance is a must love the opera extracts performed live  a few years ago they had an ice sculptor now the other performances are more around circusbalancing and dance stages expensive but well worth it at least once, if you ever visit shanghai and want to have brunch this is the place the bruch is excellent and there is nothing you will miss also you will be entertained by different shownumbers if you want, we have been for lunch on a saturday and brunch on a sunday twice now the sunday brunch includes some entertainment compared to saturday but recently the westin has included champagne with the drinks package  excellent value if youre a champagne fan the choice of food is good and because of the numbers of diners its constantly being refreshed so the quality is good too the whole atmosphere is relaxed but still is able to maintain that feeling of being special the entertainment has been slightly different each time weve been but both equally good its a real shame that he acoustics arent very good as it takes the edge off of the otherwise excellent operatic singers its not cheap but for an occasional event its a real treat highly recommended, i have now been there twice both times were superb meat lobster shrimps caviar mexican food italian food french food local specialities just name it they have it all and all of these with free flow champagne spectacular music and everything else and very reasonable price dont miss it if you happen to be in shanghai on sunday morning","Cantonese cuisine",0.999337265212188
86,"cest comme si on etait en famille un gros big up au chef phillip taylor et son equipe samsun quentina terry emily tony and others on the floor with alexis irene walter batman miley and tony hulk service efficient professional and delicate food design amazing and good balance between flavor and texture very good temperature and a lot of pleasure until the end amazing wine paring with walter thanks to all of you, i abstain from beef so i can only comment on its nonbeef menu ive been to this restaurant several times so im summarising a number of visits ive tried its mutton duck and fish so far they have not disappointed me i was a little skeptical on its fish since this is kinda a steakhouse but trust me its good the fish tastes fresh and springy the mutton was cooked just right not overdone and the meat does not taste too muttony duck is a safe bet today i ordered its duck confit

for soup if you want something heavy for winter try its onion soup for summer its clear mushroom soup is refreshing

ive not managed to eat its dessert as im quite full after appetiser and main course i shall let others comment on it, the place is nice and staffs are friendly good menu selections for foods and drinks great selection on sunday brunch menu as well as an a lacart menu with choices of beef dessert is a must to wash your taste for your next meal, went for a fivecourse winemakers dinner and the service was great quality of the food was excellent wonderful preparation and quality scallops and wagyu beef wine of course was exceptional my wife has certain allergies and staff were incredibly polite and attentive really enjoyed the ambiance and decor, on our final night at the hotel we arrived back late and needed some dinner the fifty 8 grill was never on our agenda however after viewing the menu decided to give it a go and wow was we happy we did we chose to take advantage of their thanks giving menu being offered perfect service and really accommodating for my diary intolerance only minor disappointment we had was that we paid the same for 3 bottles of water as nearly a whole bottle of wine which wasnt ideal but a brilliant meal none the less, we dined on thanksgiving evening and were delighted with the excellent set menu provided by the restaurant the food was tasty hot well cooked and beautifully presented there was ample portions served by attentive staff my only and quite genuine complaint is that we were offered water but it was not made clear from the outset that there was a charge and quite an excessive one for the water we paid nearly <u+00a3>30 for 3 bottles of water we also purchased wine and were given the wine list with prices in advance to make our choice i am disappointed that such a lovely experience was marred by such an inexpensive item as water perhaps the charge should be advised before the client agrees to have it i would dine here again but drink wine not water, we came here for a dinner but started in the qi bar in the mandarin oriental they there reserved a place for us so we later just came over
the interior is very modern and give a bit of a cool atmosphere we ordered some oysters which were outstanding as a main dish we shared a 1 kg piece of steak grilled to the point  and very tasty with some side dishes together we got an excellent dinner
the service was very friendly fast and helpful just excellent
only can say by time i will come here again, i have visited a few times while staying at the mandarin oriental and have also visited with colleagues and the food and service are always superb i particularly love the escargot and foie gras creme brulee to start and the steaks are always amazing seasoned and cooked to perfection and with a great choice of side dishes for dessert i love the peanut parfait and the yogurt pannacotta with granita i definitely need to arrange another visit soon, the hotel is part of the mandarin oriental hotel complex we had dinner one night my wife had the lobster bisque and octopus salad i had a salmon entree food nicely prepared and tasty excellent service good area of breads prices are high but not outlandish for a hotel restaurant, me and a few of my friends we eat together in different restaurants around shanghai once a week we picked 58 grill this time from a friends recommendations

 service i have to say that the service is way much better than some restaurants on the bund i was asked if we have any allergies or certain things we wanna avoid when i was making a reservation since we have 5 people and would like to share they suggested us to take the chefs special lunch menu which is picked from the a la carte very thoughtful and we decided to trust the chef
when we were having the meal  restaurant manager was very helpful also the chef came to give us greetings we had a small conversation he is cute btw

 food well i always think that warm food is the best for empty stomach among the 4 appetizers the foie gras in creme brulee style was superb with the fluffy toast for main courses the dry aged cote de boeuf was beautifully and perfectly cooked tender and succulent snapper fennel risotto was interesting we all loved it oh the side dish gratin dauphinois we just couldnt stop eating that was really good and desserts chocolate souffle absolutely is the best i have ever tasted

its a little pricey but we had a great time there and will for sure come back again thank you for the good service and amazing food, we stayed at the mandarin oriental and stopped at fifty 8 grill for a quick late lunch they offer an all you can eat meat brunch it includes a choice for appetizer soup and soup along with 45 kinds of meat you can get i wasnt particularly hungry so my husband got the set brunch and i order a braised short rib everything we go was delicious especially the skirt steak that was part of the brunch the service was great as well just be prepare to pay the pricey bill, like others the onion soup is fantastic but ill rate this on it being a steak place id say overall it was pretty good properly cooked and seasoned however it was pretty pricey but i guess this is shanghai an in a hotel overall i thought it was a great place to eat a meal if you dont want to venture out of the hotel, the dishes we recommend are the onion soup  simply delicious fish perch and chips pork belly and the peanut butter ice cream although we ordered the 1kg dry aged tbone we found the beef to be mediocre to tasteless

the next time im back ill most probably be sticking to the onion soup fish and chips or pork belly and dessert, we had a great meal and the chef came out to greet and recommended some nice dishes for five of us for the entire evening i saw the restaurant seated less than 30 people the timeless and attentiveness of the service must be improved and i do hope to visit the chef again in the future, amazing food both great in flavors and contemporary in presentation and combinations chef phillip taylor masters both the classics french onion soup is out of this world and the creative dishes service was on par with the food as was the wine
you wont have the view but then you wont have to overpay the food and service definitely make up for this
well be back , one of the best experiences i had in shanghai perfect service very friendly and professional special mention for the director eager to make you spend a special moment objective which was achieved the sommelier made us discover chinese wines which were very interesting and for the food absolutely perfectly cooked by the chef will be soon back an address a bit far from the centre of shanghai but worth the detour, excellent cuisine and wonderful staff price is reasonable for such quality of food and services staff speaks french and english, first class place we went for dinner we were staying in bt just crossing river this place service was attentice and selection of food very good highly recommended if again in shanghai planning to return in few months, whilst attending a conference a group of friends took the easy option as opposed to heading down to the bund of eating here the wine service is excellent food great quality but its not cheap then again this is the mandarin oriental in shanghai so we werent expecting it to be portions were good and service top class this is a glassandmetal restaurant with little warmth but id certainly revisit and i suspect its very good for a formal business lunch or dinner, my husband and i visited for our tenth anniversary and were made to feel very special kenny the assistant fifty 8 grill manager was very attentive and friendlyhe even arranged a delicious anniversary cake the food was deliciousi especially recommend the beet root and goat cheese salad and the grand mariner souffle definitely choose the free flow wine if it is on offer when you visitthe wineswere matched well with each course overall this was well worth the cost and we cannot wait to revisit, i had dinner with my 14 year old son who was made very welcome the food was not only fantastic but the presentation also the team working in the restaurant were efficient and extremely informative and friendly, this past saturday i booked my favorite table for my husband and i and a couple we were entertaining from the moment we walked in we were greeted by the nicest hostesses jane and irene once seated cedric simon took over the show cedric had coordinated with the sommelier  tansy the day prior to set aside some very special california reds cedric took unbelievably great care of us in the selections of appetizers main course and desserts everything was perfect with the wines and cedric was right there prepared to do anything our guests were thoroughly entertained by the highlight of the nightthe chef jason oakley came to our table to chat jason is by far the best chef i have found not only in pudong but in shanghai as a whole to end the spectacular nightour favorite fb boss hilda anzenberger came to visit with us hilda runs the most amazing restaurants at the mandarin and its always so much fun when she is checking in on us at her restaurants i cannot wait until i come back from my summer vacation so i can eat and enjoy the experience at the fifty 8 grill, very friendly service and good wine options much better than the hotel restaurants nearby my only concern is the price of the food the restaurant serves nice tasty bistro food but up marked to a gatronomic prices happy to pay for the services food is a bit over what it should be, we stayed at the hotel celebrating my husbands birthday so we decided to have dinner at the hotel grill restaurant while the food is amazingly done with authentic fench style french onion soup escargo we had the 60 months ham which was really delicious steak was great too i am most amazed by the chefs attitude we had an inquiry on kids meal the head chef actually come out to answer our questions just to make sure they can get it right and when the kids meal arrived those are super delicious this is same level of excellent food you can serve to adults too not greasy crispy roast chicken with fresh fried peas yummy marsh potatoes we did not try their dessert because we had the birthday cake from cake shop which is also delicious but i bet next time i would definitely try their souffle pricing is a bit pricey but if you compare to mortons or any hotel steak restaurant the food actually is better, my husband and i were staying at the mo so this was a convenient place to eat the night we arrived with jet lag we shared everything a pate some tartare and a steak all of it was beautifully presented and delicious it was paired with a lovely bottle of wine
cedric the manager took excellent personal care of us we also had a souffle and it was fun to watch it bake right in the oven on the dining room floor they let me get behind the counter to take a picture of it i would highly recommend and would return, we called the hotel receptionist for making our dinner booking and confirmed by a female staff that our table is on the window side when we got there they couldnt find the booking and was told the window seats must be booked 3 days ahead after 5 minutes negotiation we finally got where were supposed to bebut we ended up the dinner at 2130 many of window tables were not occupied and the entire restaurant only got 20 full
as we noticed this is the no1 steakhouse in shanghairanking much higher than our favorite mortons we decided to give a try unfortunately they offer a very limited steaks options i dont even find what id love to eat yes the appetizers were beautifully served and tasty but the portion were the smallest ive got in shanghai and we paid 30 usd each which was totally unacceptable the beef was asked to be cooked in rare which in fact was a little bit over cooked and cold inside
were recommeded to have a burgundy wine to pair but the sommelier did not even know it had to be served with the right glasses
to the management team or someone responsible staff training and communication to each other are not good enough if you would like to see your restaurant is full every night you must do something now, the wagyu beef was not juicy and tender enough but highly priced at wine by the glass crazily expensive interns of the taste the ambience is not warm enough i did not feel any value there
not recommend, i have to agree with you that the restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated however i was surprised by the portion of the entrees which is far to match with the price they charged wagyu nothing special interns of the tenderness and its taste and its not a secret that the chefs in china dont know how to serve a beef in rare by excellence service in overall was good except a sharp way of choosing wine by the guy who recommended it to us after checked the bill its three times more expensive than new york
with the money i paid here im sure theres plenty of better restaurant in town, loved the moules mariniere and gravlax for starters  both good portions but because the steaks are more about quality than ridiculous portions so having the starters didnt leave us too full  just very happy, have had opportunity recently to dine at fifty 8 grill and it is quickly becoming our favorite in all of shanghai the meals prepared by chef jason oalkley are remarkable in every way from the quality of the food and the unique and creative presentation the fantastic dining is further enhanced by their excellent sommelier tansy zhao who really understands wine and appropriate pairings  and shares his passion about wine in a fun and unassuming waya great addition to this restaurantfifty 8 grill is  must do in shanghai for either business or special fun dinner outingsyou will not be disappointed, there isnt a restaurant in shanghai that offers a more complete dining experience than this place at the mandarin hotel we come often and look forward to more visits in 2015

top notch service that is more attentive to details about you and your needs than any other restaurant

i think its great to experience service staff that quickly meet the standards of international dining service quality every single visit in a business where service is so difficult to be consistently excellent grill 58 does it

from made breads to seasonal menus that offers french inspired meals that are anchored by an american executive chef offering wonderfully rich flavors and quality ingredients do not forget to have dessert

great job chef oakley and staff keep up the great job, the place was nice and cosy not big or crowded
good selection of wine and whiskey
food quality is good and price are actually reasonable, service and quality of food is excellent the chef jason will make any changes you desire to enhance the menu steaks and seafood are good portions, i visited the restaurant with some colleagues and we were positively surprise i order a crab salad and was so good and a foie grass with a rich wine sauce and figs ambient was nice with good furniture we had meat as main course quality of meat was ok but very nice cooked for dessert i ordered souffle and i really enjoyed definitely a place that i will recommend to visit, attentive service
atmosphere was warm quiet and pleasant
especially like the mussels mariniere as starter
lunch menu offered choice of a starter main course and one side dish plus tea coffee for rmb 208 meals were in decent portion and tasted good
high quality food ingredients were either organic or natural sources, everything was great  thanks for the great hospitalityupper accommandation friendly service delightfull dinner, its location is a bit off the beaten track but the food here is well worth coming for the blackmore steaks are a real treat and some slightly modified amber classics such as the chocolate souffle are truly worthy of a couple of michelin stars, very nice upscale �french bistro steakhouse� took a business group there for a lovely evening varied menu had items that those preferring more asian dishes might choose and excellent choices of western items wine list was strong and the service was excellent with the captain of the dining room circulating frequently ensuring that all elements of the service were addressed before requested not a large restaurant so make reservations for a very nice evening, the food at the fifty 8 grill was a sensation  the meet i ate with that special sauce one of the best i ever had  very nice people and good service very friendly and cool location i will go there again, fifty 8 grill is one of the few reasons i ever travel to pudong side of the city and it is definitely worth a trip it is perfection in every single detail from the very start the warm welcome from the staff on the floor the decor  the restaurant feels like standalone cozy venue not at all like a standard hotel deal and then comes the star of the whole experience  the food
i always judge the restaurant by the bread and here you have it up to your highest expectations home backed with wonderful crust always fresh and impossible to skip
the started always lovely  pate highly recommended as well as norway salmon or very refreshing salads with apples
i know it is grill restaurant and i am more of a fish fan so i go for turbot most of the times just because it is impeccable extensive choice of white and red wines by the glass and bottle pairs up with the food just right
the desserts are great especially sorbet chef is very creative and always adds some seasonal touch i cant remember the name of the last invention it features the delicious peach and is a must to try
just writing this review made me hungry again congratulations to the team on welldone projects and recommendations to all the travelers or shanghai localsoldtimers to check the place out, the restaurant is beautiful fantastic food excellent service i loved everything

in fact almost everything the only drawback was able to make that evaluation because it involves integrity the golden water blow

we entered the restaurant sweating because it was some 35c 95f as soon as we sat down no questions asked the waiter simply opened and served the golden water we drank the water and he quickly brought another we had a wonderful meal and when the bill came i realized that a third of the account was because of two bottles of water and it was a lunch with starter main dessert coffee and wine for 2

water i learned in school that water is tasteless and odorless if there is a niche market that pays 5 bucks per sip of water i respect but i cant accept as a standard and which therefore does not need to be warned

ok i drank the water i could have asked the price could be on the menu but i wouldnt expect a cheap stunt like that of a brand like mandarin oriental, i went there for lunch as they have a great deal for 2 courses

for once i did not take their pate de campagne my favorite but duck consome with cepes really well executed my main course was a classic french dish skate sauce viergegreat advise from their manager stephane

but i need to say my highlight as always is their fromage blanc lemon sorbetlegendary for me

definitely worth going to pudong especially with the excellent service as it is not always the case even in fine dining, came here 71314 for dinner had the salmon one of the salads and the chateaubriand at rare

pros
 great great service
 good appetizers
 great ambience
 good quality meat
 sauce for the meats were really good


cons
 overpriced entries for their portions
 restaurant is very hard to find, the service was the best we have had in china but what else would you expect from a mandarin oriental restaurant

we had the filet mignon which was beautifully served on a marble platter we also enjoyed the french onion soup king crab app and salads all were excellent

also very good drinks, came now for the fourth time although prices are very high i believe the steaks are the best in town cooked to the point and prepared fresh in order no precooking
good selection of wines and very attentive staff, ably run by stephane b this is a high class restaurant with a menu that appeals to my particular penchant for high pedigree service food and quality food pairing wines an incredibly high standard for a non chinese eatery in shanghai it could hold its head up high anywhere in the world

try the chocolate souffle to end it all  you will be dreaming of it for nights to come a truly great experience in shanghai, fifty 8 grill is located at the mandarin oriental pudong is part of it this restaurant is outstanding in all aspects freshly baked bread is so crunchy and great taste  variety appetizers are innovative great quality and the mains are superb the quality of meat is just delicious and all well grilled with freshly made bearnaise sauce great art wine pairing is excellent ask the waiters to advice they know their �metier� and then the dessert�best �creme brulee� in asia is served here
do not speak about the price as this is worth the money�, i discovered the fifty8 grill of mandarin oriental hotel in shanghai last week and i will go back again for sure

it is one of the best restaurant in town great atmosphere and service the food is really delicious and they have a nice selection of wines by the glass

business lunch for 208 rmb only for a quality like this, last night enjoyed ch malescot wine dinner from china wines  spirits first visit to mandarin oriental started outside on a lovely deck with a towering view all around delicious deutz and hdos loved the cheese puffsrolls dinner was superb with pig and beef cuts to go with the vertical bordeaux tasting the 1989 was delic now not only was the chef on form but the service staff were outstanding and on top of their game the designs of the room are excellent with the indoor outdoor space and a display chef with oven very well done, this is a very elegant and beautiful restaurant with a great service and a sublime meat quality everything in this place is state of the art food drinks service only issue is that you pay a huge price to get all of this it is not cheap at all bu t the meat is one of the best you can get in shanghai","sport bar",0.999748686042893
87,"highly recommended for night time view plus a chance to eat as well our tour guide suppossingly said 11 different sizes of pearls used lol admission is quite cheap starting $160 rmb about $30 cdn cant get this in vancouver right, make sure you book on line first its the best advice i can giveit gets really crowdedyour ink allowed so many in a lifttheres 3 floorsand a revolving restrraunt which again you must booki went to the first floorwhich was 66 floors up it was enough for methe views are stunning of all shanghaitheres certainly plenty of buildings to seeand of the river bund
you have to que to get ineven if you have a ticket make sure you allow plenty of time there are restaurants next door and in the building clealy try to allow for a nice dayas it mists very quicklybut also goes if your paitent enough, excellent view from the topaptly captures the beaut of shanghaiworth visiting and a must visit, we visited the restaurant to celebrate the birthday of one of our six as well as celebrating australia day
bad start we arrived for our 5pm reservation no knowledge of the booking i rang from australia a few weeks before to book luckily a window table for 6 was found the weather wasnt perfect but we had a good vista of the city and the various buildings and of course the river
we found the food to be excellent with an extensive choice of asian and western cuisine the more you looked the more you found tucked away it was great value for money by international standards as you would expect the wine was expensive but that is relatively standard for china
i loved the sashimi duck abalone prawns pasta roast and finally the desserts we were very satisfied with the quantity and quality of the food i would describe the service as average
recommend, oriental pearl tower dongfang mingzhu is a must to visit our hotel was nearby so could walk to the tower had an amazing meal in the rotating restaurant the lighting was a little disappointing as some of the lights in the ceiling were not working so a lot of pictures were too dark we had vip tickets but that did not seem to be recognised and still had to que very pleased we went when it was not busy the amazing glass floor is an experience well worth trying, awesome place
clean city
nice people
big buildings well managed traffic
best place for shopping
place to visit
neinging road
tv tower
world economic center
the silk factory
yuan market, i spent a long afternoon visiting the oriental pearl and the museum on the first floor i have a couple of very wet and rainy days in shanghai and visiting the pearl was a good indoor activity option its definitely worth paying to get the head set guide which made my visit more informative there are also great little gift shops scattered though out prices are reasonably, went here as part of a private tour with our own guide we expected spectacular views of shanghai but the buffet was surprisingly good and worth the expense  it also means you bypass the queues up the tower which is great on way down you join the throng in the viewing deck there is small roller coaster indoors for kids that can be missed before the journey back down to what is the best museum i have visited in china on shanghais history followed by a walk in the financial district on elevated walkways a real highlight of our tour, i think it should be common knowledge that one does not go to buffets for the quality of food it is usually the quantity of food or a unique location attraction however the oriental pearl tv tower of shanghai revolving restaurant had pretty good food as well as a large quantity of it the main attraction of course is the view from the pearl tower you can visit other floors to get a better view of the city the revolving is a nice touch, it is a very nice place to go and visit many ways to get there and very easy to find to get into the place they charge you also inside the thing you can find a restaurant but i do not believe that it is the best one haha
anyway i recommend people to go but also to go at night time and take some pictures outside of it, i went late in the afternoon a couple of hours before closing time there were no long queues and before i knew i was at the top

but first the tower looks in the night very beautiful with all those lights

at the entrance you can buy a ticket to go to the top i advice skip the top and go one floor lower where you can go outside and walk on the glass floor i really got a strange funny feeling when walking on this glass floor the first couple of minutes my knees got really weak

if you go to the top be aware that going down to the glass floor can take a while due the queue for the elevator

besides the glass floor there is a floor with a big video screen which gives an impression of shanghaichina in the future there is also an arcade room to play some games and there is a rollercoaster which was fun to do after the rollercoaster i went down on my way to my hotel

after seeing the sky tower in tokyo macau tower in macau and the stratosphere in vegas the view from the pearl tower is not that special

the best moments for me was the glass floor and the view of the tower when you are outside, this tower really makes the skyline of shanghai really interesting and futustic so i thought we would give this place a visit it was once the tallest structure in china looks amazing at night time with it<u+00b4>s led sequencesgetting to the top of the tv tower is a major effort due to packed crowds i went one evening with a group on the tail end of a typhoon and unfortunately the revolving restaurant was surrounded by rain clouds and fog we saw absolutely nothing as for the food i would label it as standard buffetnot great not bad but lots of asian food choicesi was taken to this restaurant for lunch by chinese hosts the restaurant rotates very slowly with great views of shanghai which is the main attraction the core of the restaurant is a circular buffet with everything imaginable arranged into stations i didnt taste any standouts but i imagine that most people are here for the view and not the food, this tower really makes the skyline of shanghai really interesting and futustic so i thought we would give this place a visit it was once the tallest structure in china looks amazing at night time with it<u+00b4>s led sequences, i was taken to this restaurant for lunch by chinese hosts the restaurant rotates very slowly with great views of shanghai which is the main attraction the core of the restaurant is a circular buffet with everything imaginable arranged into stations i didnt taste any standouts but i imagine that most people are here for the view and not the food, getting to the top of the tv tower is a major effort due to packed crowds i went one evening with a group on the tail end of a typhoon and unfortunately the revolving restaurant was surrounded by rain clouds and fog we saw absolutely nothing as for the food i would label it as standard buffetnot great not bad but lots of asian food choices, the view was great i was so excited on the glass floor you can see most of shanghai on the top floor, its wonderful tower with very big and amazing museum that shows china culture and history
may be 2 hours or more require just for museum and take a photo
top ot the tower is
amazing place for take a unique photo
and has nice perspective
totally is good attraction in there, dont go on a sunday  we went to have a look and it was packed come back on monday and got the buffet lunch at the revolving restaurant which included the middle sphere and museum only 10min wait to get in but almost 1hr to get out of the place
the view was good to close by but the city smog was hard to see further out
lunch at the restaurant was great  a lot of selections drinks cost extra 20yuan for coke can, after reading many reviews i was expecting to be in a 2 hour que i only waited in a 20 minute que this was because i only went to the centre pearl specifically for the glass bottom observation deck which is the only thing worth seeing here it was fun to step on the glass and take funky pictures also funny to see certain people afraid of stepping on the glass

if you want to see a real high view go to the shanghai tower where you will see views from the 4th tallest building in the world, one of the top shanghai atractions be prepared to wait 2 hrs before you get to the 260 m platform view is spectacular particularly in the evening not to be missed while in shanghai, nice view however it is very crowded but ok you can take excellent photos from that place you can go easily by metro exit 1 is the closest exit to reach the place there are some malls near by where you can eat and spend the day  the museum is also a very nice experience included in the entrance ticket to the tower, made a dinner reservation for the revolving restaurant and it surpassed my expectations the views where spectacular and as the sun went down and all the buildings lights came on it was amazing the food was incredibly good quality with an enormous choice from the buffet there was table service for drinks which was excellent we opted for the unlimited soft drinks for 48 yuan pp and the unlimited one which included beer for 68 yuan once we had finished eating we went down to the glass viewing floor then down to the gaming floor and lastly down to the museum on the ground floor our dinner price included all this so it was excellent value i would unreservedly recommend this for all ages, visiting the glass floor was a dream and i really enjoyed it by standing on it at more than 200m hight organized but was smelling bad from inside, to stay in sh you have to go to the tv tower and river you can use the ferry if you are on the wrong side 3<u+00a5> great view and amazing glass ground at the top, indeed a beautiful place and a work of art and excellence of design by the chinese builders you can dine and see the complete city of shanghai it is a wonder of human perception and art the view is panoramic and you find people scary while walking on glass floor while you take food the restaurant revolves, nice experience watching shanghai passing through your eyes but the best view is on floor below if you want to have a good lunch or dinner to stop here the food is average and the service seems always busy even if not, being a senior saved 40 when you walk on glass around 90th floor buy the professional photos they are so clear and
inexpensive would go again

l, extraordinary view great place for families and couples almost every thing is offered on the buffet menu but i have to confess that i was not so impressed by the food nonetheless it was a great experience one must make a booking before visiting since it becomes really busy and if you need a table by the window which is why you visit this restaurant then you must specify while making the booking, this is pretty special to see during the day but wow it comes to life at night i stayed at the seagull of the bund and had views of this throughout our stay its light show is one of its own posted some lovely pics to share my experience definitely worth seeing for anyone 
trav  jessi goldcoast aus, we chose to go in the morning after catching the ferry across after reading the negative reviews of the under river tunnel plenty of people but nothing like there would have been at night great to see the city in day light make sure you wander around the ring walkway before going in the gardens are spectacular, we was very looking forward to seeing this and having a nice meal but it turned out to a disaster no where does it tell you how to get in and we tried about three different entrances then we could only see people going in with a ticket we asked a person in the travel centre how do we get in and they said around to the left but never mentioned you needed a ticket anyhow we queued up and said we need a ticket as we are having dinner in the restaurant the girl told us it was 160 rmb each so we paid it and got in to the tower it was big and there was lots of queueing inside and a long wait for the lift then when we got up to the 267th floor we couldnt find the restaurant and it wasnt well sign posted we walked around and found it in the end when we got there the girl told us we had to have another ticket to have dinner so we said sod this and went back outside then my husband cant walk very well and they didnt want him to take the lift he had to walk down the stairs and she closed the doors on him the second time it happened he just forced the doors open and got in so rude and so disappointed never going there again and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you can speak good fluent chinese of course, visited with a group for dinner the venue is fantastic with a revolving view of shanghai

the buffet selection is wide but sadly none of the food i sampled was of a very good quality the meat was chewy and many of the hot dishes were merely lukewarm

many of the dishes gave the impression of being prefabricated and heated up

they could probably benefit from cutting a bit in the selection and focusing on heightened quality

the service was very average

in my opinion the tower is worth a visit but the dinner is best had somewhere else, it is my third time in this restaurant but this time it was the worst because of choices of meal i come 130 to close it
first of all i liked turning restaurant as this
if you spend there 2 hours probably you will able to see landscape of shanghai without change of your seat
they serve there some different food like see food and different meats pizza and desserts you pay 330 rmb and you eat as much as you can you pay extra if you order drink
i never needed to book table always was plenty people and still free table
food is good but it is buffet so there is nothing for high service
your visit in restaurant you can join with visit of pearl tower, in this tower located in the financial centre of shanghai there is a great restaurant its necessary a reservation if you want to be sure to enter into the restaurant its possible to eat traditional chinese food or italian american ones notwithstanding sweets ice creams and cakes you can eat everything you want vecause you pay only at the beginning the characteristic is that the place walks around while youre eating at the end or at the beginning i think you can go outside for an amazing view pf shanghai and its river incredible place to be in, worth a trip up the tower <u+00a3>44 approx to visit top floor not much good if it is cloudy glass platform  walkway pretty cool but scary, oriental pearl tv tower is a one of the most beautiful sightseeing places in shanghai especially in the nightthis tower have a glass bottom which can you walking there and sense walking in the skyin the basement of tower you can visite a museum about how entrance the western people to china and chang the life still and thinking of china people and effects developted market economy, obviously views are awesome from anywhere in the tower

our dining experience at the revolving restaurant was soso long queues ok food very poor customer service were just the beginning we were assigned to a bare table while all the beautifully dressed tables by the windows were unoccupied we fought and were finally given a proper table

even with a decent table the experience was poor, being up in the tv tower will give you a fantastic view of shanghai they have a glass bottom where you can walk around i would have rated this 5 had it not been for the included buffet food was just ok they lack in variety my daughter did not find anything to eat and just settled for pasta and ice cream, tv tower is the most beautiful place in shanghainight view is really good but very crowded n lot of noise to face, since shanghai is the most populous city in the world so expect a lot of crowd on it the place view is quite amazing we went there on dinner buffet and what makes me dissapointed is that they sell the drinks to us which i dont expect coz its a buffet and they dont even give any water to us they also have poor lighting i understand that we went there for dinner but the light is very terrible we cant even see or recognize our food or even see the face of my friends they should also change the position of every table coz some are facing backward on the view unlike the 360 macau tower restaurant ive been into different buffet restaurant but so far this is the worst for me, high rise tower overlooking the bund a bit pricey to get it and crowded there were multiple elevators needed to make it up to the top and it wasnt always the easiest to navigate in or out but a decent experience none the less, my husband has a big fear of heights but we managed to get to the top floor and take some beautiful photos we had a great view from the top floor but they then took us to the highest viewing floor with glass floors no so much fun great views nice souvenirs, only thing that i would go is the 2nd highest peak with the glass floor experience sitting in a glass floor and take photo with nice view
visiting a pearl tower is not must anymore because there are other towers life ifc and shanghai tower or jin mao tower where you can get nice scenery as well as from pearl tower

pear tower does not offer discount to students elderly or tourist, a trip to shanghai is a must do thing when in china
the towering skyline of pudong in shanghai is a constant change with new buildings be erected to out do the financial area of manhattan
the pearl tower is an enjoyable experience with stunning views from the upper viewing areas, long line big crowds worthwhile sights we bought the cheaper ticket and went on a saturday so the line was quite long and the crowd quite noisy we waited about 12 hours before getting to the top packed crowds are part and parcel with visiting china so i found the line to be quite efficient considering how busy it was and once inside it is not so bad

once at the top the views are very good the 360 platform gives you a great view of shanghai as does the glass floor edging the whole thing the glass floor is actually pretty coolor terrifying for anyone with heights  at the top they sell popcorn smothered in butter with sugar or sugar with butter as well as ice cream and drinks but no substantial food the bathrooms are cramped and smelly but not unusably dirty there is another line to go back down but once at the base there is more space and more to do if you like history and dioramas check out the shanghai history museum, wow the views were amazing well worth it for this alone we had booked a meal for 9 people when we eventually got to the floor near restuarant had to queue yet again bad organization with one girl having to try look after 100s of people hire more staff the queues were unbelievable going up to the restaurant  also just as bad trying to get back out of the tower bit scary really if they needed to evacuate the building in an emergency the sights from the restuarant were amazing but being truthful i would not go again because of the queues, the place and the view is great
it is a revolving restaurant on top of the oriental pearl tower what else can you ask for the truth is you only eat here because of the reason above
the food is all you can eat but they timed your duration there
nothing so much i can say about the food other than theyre eatable because youre hungry enough but dont expect too much of the taste the package come with 1 can of coke but no water must buy water yourself, my experience is mixed the view is unbelievable the food is just fine again how can you complain if you are paying less that usd 50 so let us be fair you get what you paid for i have to fight my way to get ice cream for my childrens only one scoop for childrens lucky the supervisor was around and my son was able to get two scoops but overall the experience was fine as i always said will go again sure i will, i liked the interior this restaurant but i havent tried the food i will try another time to visit shanghai, obviously the view is breathtaking

the food then is international with everything you can possibly eat many many choices

the experience is totally worth it you should try to book it whenever you come by shanghai the place is impressive","steakhouse",0.997957508295394
88,"whilst staying at the holiday inn around the corner we found ourselves eating at this italian restaurant on two nights entertaining business guests the home made food and pasta were excellent freshly prepared  the best italian food i have ever experienced outside italy please try their pizzas the prices were reasonable quality red wine was reasonably priced as well the indoor seating area has that authentic italian decor and feel making it a real italian experience i tried the tiramisu dessert it was so delicious i wished the portions were larger the owner gave us his personal attention the waitress and waiter serving us were amazing loved it, at al borgo they only serve the most delicious authentic italian food in the whole of shanghai i particularly recommend the pizza which is some of the best pizza i have ever tasted i also recommend the gnocchi made fresh and tastes delicious
it is clearly very popular as almost all the tables were full so i would suggest booking in advance if you live downtown it is worth the journey just to experience a wonderful meal here
the bottom line here is that al borgo serves the best italian cuisine at the lowest prices so you will not be dissatisfied, every dish we ordered were amazing homemade pasta dishes linguine with duck bolognese sauce  gnocchi calamari we loved it so much we ordered another one seabass mediterranean style tiramisu and panna cotta were beautifully presented and super yummy we asked the very friendly owner to suggest a good bottle of wine and he brought us a perfect red wine that went very well with all our dishes
the restaurant was decorated nicely and considering how crowded it was the noise level was pretty low
cant wait to go back there to try all their dishes, amazing italian food unlike anything else youll have in asia al borgo does real quality italian with a focus on fresh quality ingredients that you dont really find anywhere else except for italy great staff and great setting def the best italian ive had in shanghai, located few km away from shanghai hongqiao airport it may not look very convenient for who lives in downtown but i can guarantee that it is worth the trip
i was taken there by an italian friend with the promise to have a taste of the real italian home made food so it was
the cold cuts and the cheese were imported from italy and pretty good i appreciated very much the real mortadella  bologna for the americans   with the pistachos inside
also the goat cheese met my taste
because we were not sure what was the best choice the owner from the north east of italy offered a taste of two different kind of pasta both were excellent
but to me the apotheosis came with the succulent stracotto di manzo con polenta stewed beef with cornmeal mush
to me that was the real taste of home
the service was impeccable and the atmosphere friendly all at an honest price
five stars rating absolutely well deserved, such a delight to have maksys al borgo restaurant open in our neighbourhood maksy is a great host always there to welcome his guests and he has trained his staff well too the food is delicious they are continually adding new dishes and desserts particular favourites are the meat and cheese platter the homemade ravioli and the chocolate fondant
maksys limoncello is a wonderful digestif
the only issue will be being able to get a table in the future booking will become essential i think, al borgo is a fantastic and superfriendly little country style italian restaurant there is an original menu featuring carefully selected imported italian meats and cheeses the ravioli are delicious and homemade in fact everything on the menu is so so good and great value it is easy to forget what part of the world you are in after an evening at al borgo

89,"the food at vegetarian lifestyle was spectacular we ordered the shanghai noodles a couple of tofu dishes and the mixed dumplings for dessert we ordered an impressive fungi and pear dessert the environment was nice but a bit too sterile for my liking great place, we are mostly vegeterian and living inshanghai this resturant was a prize discoverywe often go here and nanjing road branch for lunch  the food is tasty and fresh the service is quick and cordialhighy recommended for vegan and vegeterian at shanghai, we are at two vegetarian places during our stay this one and another named godly this place was far better not only is the food fabulous with so many options it took us 20 min to choose but also the staff here were super friendly you have to try the pork chops, not easy to find vegetarian food in shanghai was very happy to stumble upon vegetarian lifestyle have been eating there several times and it was always excellent
service was a bit slow after i had received the menu card finally had to signal one of the waiters again slow and not attentive at paying the bill but surroundings food and price are highly recommended, great restaurant but every time they tinker with the menu the ruin it and take away another good item i dont know why they do it staff speaks no english but theyre friendly and helpful and try to accommodate as much as possible very reasonable priced, this restaurant serves delicious food a great place for real vegetarian food  the staff are really polite and the restaurant really clean i highly recommend you eat at this reasonably priced restaurant  so good , this place was great and deserved five stars for the different tastes plating and service  easy to find although in a side alley with large signage out front and close to the mrt station  making a reservation is suggested, as a vegetarian i dont often find many choices when in china but this was a great find a great range of dishes inexpensive and really delicious well worth checking out even if you arent vegetarian located a few minutes from the south end of peoples square, i came at 900 on a monday when they close at 930i was the only one there staff was still fine with serving me and the food did not disappoint this is definitely better to have a big group of people and order a bunch of things to share come for early dinner western or a typical chinese dinner time at between 57, on our last night in shanghai we decided to eat here a vegetarian myself i was traveling with two open minded nonvegetarians and they were happy to go along with a meat free meal we all thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and textures that were presented to us
i had my first ever crispy duck pancakes and enjoyed every last bite
the meal was unique and unlike any vegetarian restaurant i had eaten in in the uk i was personally overwhelmed by all the options available to me we truly had a feast that night
the restaurant itself was full of happy diners and everything was beautifully presented the staff were very helpful and friendly and gave great personality
if you are looking for the restaurant it is just down a street off songshan road not on the main street
highly recommend, very fresh  tasty food  good ambience bey clean place  very polite staff  overall  very happy  and would advice all vegetarians to come here , my wife is vegetarian so we often eat at vegetarian restaurants
this has to be one of the best weve eaten at in terms taste variety setting and service weve eaten at many across china japan  nz a delicious meal was enjoyed at a reasonable price a great place to dine even for someone who is not a vegetarian we would definitely come back here again, great selection of cleverly created vegetarian dishes from things looking to be meat but are not to other dishes that are totally fun tasty veggie dishes

if you havent been here and you are a vegetarian  or even if youre not i highly recommend checking it out, vegetarian food can be bland but this place knows it everything weve tasted was fine fresh and amazing we went as much as we could as its been kind of a crush such a vast menu made of the best ingredients served fast for a very decent price no doubt itd go back  id make sure im very hungry they do not serve alcohol as far as i know kitchen closes before 9, i used to live in shanghai and dined here 4 or 5 times a week whenever i return it is the first restaurant i return to amazingly varied menu this branch in songshan road
can get very busy there is another branch in fengxian road equally as good but less busy i have also been their chengdu restaurant i wish there was one in every city, you will get alot of amazing dishes here some of them are mock meat and others regular vegetarian food this place has several branches and the food is consistent i like the spicy thai fried rice, dinner was very nice and the menu was interesting we had eaten a lot of meat during our stay in shanghai and it was great to have so many non meat options my favorites were the buckwheat sprout temaki which was as pretty as it was tasty the mixed assorted vegetables braised mushrooms and the stirfried pine mushrooms with basil im not a big fan of tofu made to resemble meat and didnt enjoy our selection with tofu chicken there was no alcohol only tea and non alcoholic beer the tea was very good but i had been looking forward to a beer and was disappointed the service was good and the atmosphere comfortable, this place is amazing and cheep pure veggie food and so tasty i strongly recommend this place  no alcohol because its a buddhist restaurant but really worth it, i had the stir fried lotus roots with green pepper and pine nuts with something on the side that looked like a veetex basically it tasted like stuff in a ketchup sauce
also i ordered the fried rice with vegetarian salted fish  chicken it was mainly boring and unfortunately nobody could tell me if the meat was tofu or seitan since nobody spoke english also im not sure if they cooked it fresh the food was served 5 minutes after ordering but at least its vegetarian which is really hard to find in china and im willing to try more stuff from the menue, i think i wrote it already in a review on the po lin monastery in hk but it is worth to remind the readers that i am not vegetarian
in spite of that i cannot deny that vegetables are a fundamental part of my diet and i like to go to the traditional buddhist restaurants
in my opinion this one is slightly different as it mixes the tradition with a touch of modernity and creativity
if you are not chinese and you want to have a vegetarian experience while visiting shanghai this restaurant may fit your taste better than many others
in my humble opinion the food taste is good even if sometimes the quality is not consistent as it always happen in china the restaurant is clean and quiet
the food presentation is good as well
please keep in mind that here it is not served alcohol but you can enjoy excellent teas and other good healthy drinks, i visited this restaurant for an evening meal while alone in shanghai for the weekend as a vegetarian it can be difficult to eat in china if you dont speak the language however here it was so easy the staff all spoke english and the menu had english translations too in fact the menu was probably the best ive seen for a vegetarian restaurant  so much to choose from and everything i had was delicious im sure i ate far too much when ordering a small cold dish to start and then two warm dishes i chose a vegetarian version of what might be called a take on peking duck ive always been jealous seeing people tuck into those little pancakes and now i finally got to enjoy it for myself the only downside was that it was slightly expensive but it certainly was worth it

id definitely recommend a visit here, very nice food i am not a vegetarian but we had vegetarians in our group all were impressed there is a very wide range of options on the menu from standard vegetable stirfrys to very impressive chicken balls spicy fungi and flaversom fryed lotus root in the local area there are few vegetarian restaurants of this quality and diversity highly recommended even if you are not vegy the staff were good by chinese standards and the prices were reasonable <u+00a3>1015 a head no alcohol available but there are bars just around the corner 20 meters or so, best dont come alone so you can order the whole menu down 

even for experienced eaters this place holds great surprises, even as a longtime vegetarian this place has some of the most creative menu options ive seen i dont normally go for fake meats but some were just too crazy not to try where else in the world are you going to find vegetarian spare ribs delicious there are plenty of true veggie options as well with delicious eggplantaubergine and mushroom dishes

compared to other restaurants in shanghai this is a little more expensive though still unbelievably cheap by western standards finding reliable clean vegetarian food when you dont speak the language is not the easiest the pictorial menu with english labeling is quite extensive youll likely end up ordering and eating way too much food but it will all be delicious

as other reviews have pointed out the restaurant is not on the street itself but down an alley google maps banned in china has it in the correct location other mapping software can be dodgy in china i recommend taking a screen capture before you leave to make sure you end up in the right place, a clean vegetarian restaurant with many choices chinese style and ingredients the service is excellent we like particularly the lotus root aubergine and dim sum it is a little more more expansive though we visit the place every time we come to shanghai, i think this restaurant is amazing i am not a veggie but i do love this place  good food  good service and good clean restaurant  price is quite reasonable , i absolutely love chinese vegetarian food especially places like these that create meatstyle dishes especially given how difficult it can be to eat veg in china coming to a place like this where the menu is 100 veg is delightful there are a few locations and i visited two on a recent trip to shanghai the ambiance was nice at both very clean and the staff is also friendly the food is fantastic i miss it already heads up though no alcohol as is common at chinese veg places as most as buddhist, i went here for dinner with my husband its nice quite place  staff
speaks english
they serve very good vegan food they dont use even egg they have a very long list of mock tail drinks
and juice which was very tempting but it was unfortunate they had none to serve when we were there only packed ones were available  food was good and reasonable, visited this place for lunch as i had read quite a few good things about it via ta also being a vegetarian i was quite excited about the prospect of my food not swimming in meat juices we ordered the dumplings the tea infused mushrooms and an aubergine dish i would say i was a little disappointed by the aubergine dish as it said it came with meaty bits which i was expecting some kind of marinaded tofu also the picture which i assumed was of the meal didnt look anything like the actual dish the sauce was rich and the aubergines were broken up and very soft but pretty bland the dumplings were also a bit on the bland side i could see that they had used lots of ingredients inside but just not enough flavour the mushroom dish was delicious and by far the best option there was a large selection on the menu so i would probably give this a second try staff were fairly polite as well, very pleasant vegetarian retaurant in the pudong section of shanghai attractive atmosphere wide variety of choices typical of the vegetarian restaurants in china tasty food excellent service reasonable prices, were not vegetarians but the food was excellent we had the veggie sausage which tasted like meat tofu skin wrapped vegetable the steamed red bean bun dumplings and the fried noddles the only drawback is that they dont serve alcohol the price was right as well, i was very pleased to find this restaurant as a vegetarian in china its sometimes hard to find a quality veggie feast but we practically stumbled over this place one day unintentionally reformed meat eaters might enjoy the creative vegetarian short ribs with tangy barbecue saucy or sweet and sour vegetarian chicken balls if you werent paying attention you might think you were actually eating meat

i quite enjoyed the meal here and look forward to going back good value for a large two person meal, im not a vegetarian but can say this was one of the eating experiences ive had on my most recent trip to shanghai the food was fresh delicious and arrived quickly the prices were higher than you pay for their meaty counterparts in some other restaurants but the difference is negligible if youre crazing veggie fare

highly recommended and im looking forward to going back my one complaint is that they dont serve alcohol so no wine or beer they offer nonalcoholic options butmeh, i had lunch here the other day and thought the menu was awesome hard to choose because so many good options and was really happy with the 3 dishes my wife and i tried as others have mentioned it is a bit more expensive than other places but the food is really good definitely felt like value for money

the drinks here are quite expensive 20 yuan for a can of coke although we were served a complimentary green tea with our lunch the photos posted on here helped us find the restaurant, i visited the branch of this restaurant which is a short walk from peoples square with my omnivore boyfriend three times during our short stay in shanghai having struggled through many menus with limited veggie options at other establishments once we found this place we kept going back theres a large selection of different dishes to choose from which was very welcome and an easy to use english friendly menu with pictures the staff were very friendly towards us and the prices were reasonable though more on the pricey side by chinese standards for us it was good value for the high standard of food especially after some unfortunate experiences with upset tummies i recommend the fried mushrooms in sweet and sour sauce and the spring rolls the noodles were also very good although an option for smaller portions would have been useful to compliment the other dishes one portion of rice or noodles could easily be shared between 2 or more peoplethis was probably the best food i had during my whole trip around china and i highly recommend visiting, we went to one of their branches and we were delighted with a really fast class food experience communication was a bit difficult with no chinese but the menu has pictures and we almost got all the dishes right the food was on the whole delicious and all our party joined in to taste all the portions the bill at the end was also very reasonable for all we ate, this is a restaurant i would cheerfully recommend to everyone even the now veg actually went to the jianging branch near west nanjing station its so much a delight to eat there i do eat there at least once or twice for every visit in shanghai last time out i had an awesome hot water with a smell of burn rice and oats in it always the language is an issue but the food so so nice, i had dinner here few years ago when my family just moved to shanghai perhaps i was quite new at that moment it was great 2nd time visit it was completely changed waiters are hard to find like fast food service food was unseasoned when i asked for a fresh chili the first time i got some chopped one but this time they gave an caned chili sauce which is too salty waited 10 minutes for the bill the timeless of the service was bad too, i went to another branch at 258 fengxian road close to the nanjing rd w metro station ta does not seem to list this one
i had a very pleasant late lunch here i ordered the skewers and hot and sour soup and two desserts all were tasty andor very interesting in any case any vegetarian restaurant in very vegetarianunfriendly china is basically a winner by default, i visited this place with my friends for late lunch one of whom was a vegetarian i was pleasantly surprised that most of the dishes we ordered were very tasty even for a person like me who needs to eat meat for every meal

the staff were very attentive and polite the environment and accessibility of the place is pretty good too

the downside is that the restaurant isnt really cheap as is advertised here on tripadvisorif you are hungry you should expect to pay about 80100 rmb to fill your own belly, this is superb vegetarian restaurant the food is mostly chinese meaning a lot of fake meat though there are some other options the menu is in chinese and english with photos if you dont know either the service is quick and attentive the food is tasty and served beautifully i highly recommend it, my vegetarian radar was in overdrive when i stumbled on this place i was just walking by and there it was and right around lunchtime too my husband and i had been to 2 other fake meat places in shanghai and i was yearning for some vegetarian food that actually has vegetables this restaurant did not disappoint i even had a great salad yes there is the fake meat but there are also creative vegetable options and the fake meat isnt as intensely meat like as some places the place is nicely decorated and felt hip to me i really enjoyed eating there by myself and would go back in a heart beat, the first time i ate there was about 8 years ago the food was much more better before it is hard to tell why but it is just better before even though the dishes havent changed much the service is ok the price is acceptable i will come back, everything we tried tasted delicious we tried a lot of different dishes  salads fried skewers eggplant soymeat etc ive been to a lot of vegetarian restaurants but this was definitely one of the best the staff was super friendly and really helpful, not a big fan of vegetarian cuisines myself this place was quite delicious while elegant im not saying that i would ever convert to a vegetarian but i would certainly consider returning to this restaurant they certainly deserve their award for best vegetarian restaurant for 2014, the fusion between traditional and modern vegetarian restaurant here is evident
it is not a cheap restaurant but the quality of the food is very good
i strongly recommend this restaurant also to the tourists and the foreigner business travellers
the taste of the vegetarian fish and meat will surprise you, we were in shanghai for a few days in january 2014 and visited this restaurant 3 times the restaurant itself is chic but simple

there is a superb selection of delicious vegan dishes the ribs are a must try everything is cooked really well with little oil and the sauces are thick and sticky the selection of mock meats and traditional chinese dishes replaced with vegetables sticky mushrooms instead of sticky beef for example is really good and enough to satisfy any omnivores as well as vegans the smoky tea is also a great accompaniment to the food

it was good value for money in western terms if a bit expensive comparitively for china at about <u+00a3>20 per head for a massive amount of food and many pots of teathe service was great and the menu was available in english it is very popular with westerners i would definitely recommend a visit and will certainly be returning if i ever go back to shanghai, went twice during a weeks business trip to shanghai with a group of mainly nonvegetarians i thought it was really good  and everyone else really enjoyed i had no trouble convincing them about the second visit very reasonably priced as well they dont serve alcohol but have a selection of soft drinks and some amazing fruit juice mixtures quite a surprise to find a restaurant like this in shanghai, this all vegetarian restaurant might be a bit hard to find but it will definitely be worth it for a great vegetarian lunch in the huiahai road business area from huaihai turn on songshan road for about 1 block and look for an archway with 77 on it go through the arch and the restaurant is about 100 on the left

this is a good tourist grade quality all vegetarian restaurant the restaurant is clean air conditioned and the staff is friendly its a bit more expensive than some of the localsonly vegetarian restaurants where ive also eaten in shanghai and reviewed but international travelers with higher standards will feel more at home here i wouldnt hesitate to return again, if you want to impress yourself as a non vegeterian this really is a place to go the place is spacious and very cmfortable with agreable service and courteous personnel the itmes on the menu are well construct with all the traditional meat lover terms but with no meat if found that a little strange but amusing but the real value is the taste of the plates ok forget the sausage whcih cas too dry cretive presentation and large servings a not expensive palate feast","Mexican cuisine",0.999778655862481
9,"probaly the best dumplings i have ever had tried the pork and chicken ones also had decious wonton soup and sauteed bean shoots situated in a mall this restaurant is bright clean and airy with an open kitchen where you can see the staff busily handmaking each dumpling fun mural on the wall of various chinese celebrities highly recommended, visited this restaurant for dinner with a work colleague fantastic dumplings of all kinds i especially loved ones with black truffle and chicken  just wonderful environment is bright with an open kitchen where you can see them busily handmaking each dumpling fun mural on the wall of various chinese celebrities reasonable prices highly recommended, you cant go wrong with din tai fung this is a very popular dumpling restaurant actually a taiwanese chain food is consistently very good restaurants are clean and prices quite reasonable, this is a beautiful resteraunt in a modern setting on the third floor of the super brand mall we were there for the lunch twice and the food is yumm the pork dumplings hot and sour soup with tofu and noodles in soya sauce are to die for red bean sweet dumplings are a hit too but only to the discerning

the service is efficient and courteous a check mark if visiting shanghai, a bit hard to find on lg2 floor outside of main area great service great good pleasant and relaxing atmosphere, i was invited to this restaurant and enjoyed the food which was very delicious as it caters also to international customers besides the famous dim sum and other dishes the river prawns can be highly recommended, this is one of their restaurants in town they prepared fresh dumplings after you order excellent quality and price the restaurant setting is very clean and lean, is a must visit place in shanghai
their dumplings are the best the skin of the dumplings are not thick like the ones in yu garden
taste also better then yu garden
fried rice was fantastic as well
not oily i tried their shredded pork with prawns
staff was very friendly
do remember to ask the staff to repeat the orders because mine was 2 drinks messed up came not i ordered the drinks but was ok they change it for me
they speak english abit slow
well we are in china and english is not their mother tongue, i have tried this chain in hong kong but i wanted to give it a go in shanghai
everything is just so  neat clean and when i arrived at least empty like an operating theatre
highlight of the order strangely was the spicy sesame noodles the 5 pork dumplings looked small in the basket as did the equivalent number of prawn ones but everything was cooked perfectly and the jasmine tea was a good accompaniment
the atmosphere sparked up as the early lunchers arrived but my table remained a haven of calm albeit with some over fussy pouring of tea as soon as i got an inch from the bottom of the cup
din tai fung at super brand mall in shanghai is as good as any others i have eaten in though the ones in hong kong feel livelier
i left full having had some great dumplings  texture and flavour wise little to fault  but remained curiously unsatisfied, i tried different din tai fung restaurant but in my opinion probably this is the best 
food and quality are superior even on dim sum  i enjoyed even a great soup with noodle different vegetables and for sure different dim sum  all with a jasmine tea
strongly recommended, we had a great time at this restaurant very nice food service was very efficient not expensive at all it is very recomended for a taste of a asian chain you will be surprised try it, of all the dtfs i have been to in the world the service here is the worst server screwed up the order a number of timesand she got mad thankfully the food is consistent with the brand and delicious, i love sprout works and first encountered it in super brand mall other than that the mall has a good supermarket, the environment is bare but clean the food is not horrible but hard to call good its located in a mall so the location is pretty good, this place should be embarrassed of itself in a city with such good soup dumplings the fact that this place has become a chain is sad and it shows that they have lost quality the prices are 23x of other good soup dumpling spots the dough tastes processed and there was only lukewarm tasteless soup inside the filling was avg at best save your money and go to yangs or the mom and pop places jia jia tang baooff of people square, din tai fung is one of my favourites in shanghai always the best dumplings finest chinese dishes environment could be a little bit friendlier but staff is always super on top of their game, this place is probably perfect for the dumpling lover i eat basically everything but i had troubles with the dessert dumpling not my cup of tea i would go here again though, this place is all about the dumplings we went here for work so i did not have an option i had chicken it was served cold with a layer of skin that was very fatty i did not like the fried rice and vegetable is fine i am sure if you can eat the dumplings it is a fine restaurant my pow rating is totally based on gluten free options, excellent mainly taiwanstyle dumplings restaurant interior is very simple yet the food is as excellent as the view and there are so many dumplings to choose prices are fairly high though, i have tried din tai fung in taiwan and hk the food quality is much better this din tai fung in shanghai super brand mall is obviously below standard xiaolongbao is too dry not juicy enough wonton and steamed dumpling well i would not say its bad but its not tasty too dandan noodle forget about it

not everything is bad fried rice is good the restaurant has nice view of the shanghai waitan this place is decorated as a luxury restaurant prices are not cheap its a comfortable place if you have not tried din tai fung in other places before you may enjoy this place

din tai fung in taiwan is a much downtoearth restaurant much better food cheaper price a much more casual  relaxing place to enjoy a good meal, food here is top quality service prompt there was no queue when we went but our local friend had made reservations just in case food a bit different from other din tai fung we have tried in singapore and beijing, went here after reading all the great reviews and wasnt disappointed they had an english menu and ordering was easy service is fast the wating staff dont mess about all the food we tried tasted great and we even went back to another location the day after ate quite early as i imagine it gets very busy later on in the evening, it was our first experience with dumplings and chrysanthemum tea  and a rich beef soup definitely soothing on a rainy afternoon, this family owned chain with locations in asia and us is legendary for great food and crowds of diners in cupertino the wait for reservations is month long i was pleasantly surprised to be able to walk into this location and get a table food and service did not disappoint menu is filled with all kinds of stuff for everyones taste but in my mind you have to be crazy not to experience the variety and quality of the dim sum dishes oustanding, the soup and dim sum were excellent on the two occasions i visited with a large choice of dishes
the service was very efficient and the staff did everything possible to please, place was great wait time was ok considering we had no reservation the food was great it was soo good we where going to go back to eat at another branch but got trapped by a rain shower and couldnt make the closing time highly recommend, this was our first stop in shanghai to enjoy local dishes dumplings were good we try some steamed pork and shrimp filled and a sticky rice this last one was not so good as we expected but the rest were ok nothing wow but nice for first step english speakers is something difficult to find in restaurants, you can choose all kind of dumplings all delicious i ate dumpling with truffle too the place is not very beautiful and its expensive but its the best place for me too eat dumplings, our first experience with this well known chain and now i get it the food was fantastic we tried several varieties of dumplings wontons noodles and all were wonderful service was also good we had lunch and arrived a little early which was lucky since they filled up fast and there was quite a wait when we were leaving, the food here is excellent xiaolongbao are a must and the hot and sour soup is amazing the best of all is the sesame ball dessert this is great food and the view outside is pretty amazing too, stopped in for a late lunch and ordered the several types of pork dumplings including black truffle hot and sour soup and cucumber salad food was excellent black vinegar soy ginger and chili sauce added layers of flavor to the dumplings service was great servers were attentive to detail cheerful and helpful definitely will return, excellent service reasonable prices and great food we managed to get a private room bit had to book ahead wanton s were divine, every din tai fung i visited had great food this restaurant is no exception i find the prices are ok for european customers if you try to compare it to a chinese restaurant for locals you will find the prices expensive
some of the staff here does speak english this makes it a lot easier if your chinese is not quite good however the menu has every dish with a picture and there are english menus available, i love dim sum 
this was the best dim sum ive ever had
try the one with black truffle  divine, the classic xiaolongbao dumplings are done here very well i have tried them in other places while in shanghai  these are the best tried the hairy crab dumplings this time and could taste some crab in the dumpling unlike at another restaurant their noodles are nice and smooth if you get a table by the window you get a view of the bund thrown in, we stopped here while visiting the area good quick food in a good environment so worth visiting if you are in the area, the signature xiaolongbao soup dumplings are ok it hits the spot when you have a craving it is a pretty large chain restaurant now you can find more locations on spoonhuntcom in shanghai hangzhou beijing if you want a more local experience for soup dumplings i would recommend jiajia soup dumplings also multiple locations on spoonhuntcom
other dishes i would go for at ding tai feng are dan dan noodles spicy and the simple but amazing egg fried rice
as a taiwanese person where ding tai feng originated i would definitely recommend going to taipei for an authentic experience of dtf soup dumplings, have tried the restaurant in japan and australia and they are all consistently delicious had to wait 30 minutes cuz we were there at 730pm but worth the wait yum, we went again for a family dinner food and service are always good take care it could be a little bit noisy when the restaurant is full, my husband and i have lived in shanghai for over a year now and we never get tired of din tai fung this is a chain that lives up to the hype and deserves its michelin star the dumplings xiaolong bao are divine go with the chicken or classics pork and we also love the mushroom one make sure to sample some of the veggies as well service is excellent and if you dont speak chinese it wont be a problem there is a decent amount of english on the weekends there is usually a short wait but they are efficient and the line moves quickly, good food clean moderate to expensive but its shanghai and a mallwent here a few times kids loved seeing the dumplings being prepared live worth a visit, this is the place for authentic dumplings in china you can watch the cooks make them through the glass there is a wide variety of dumpling choices and other dish options they also have the famed shanghai pork cutlet, right by the river in the super brand mall  this branch is in an excellent location the xiao long bao are a musthave  there are different options available best to show up early for a table on weekends although i only waited about 15 minutes for a table of four on a saturday night, the xiao long bao here are incredible and they do mini ones too we also had special fried rice some stir fried vegetables and puddings like a red bean paste bun you can watch them making the dumplings through glass windows into the kitchen be warned the xiao long bao are much more filling than you think we never managed more than 10 between the 3 of us but they are unbelievably delicious the sensation when the soup hits your mouth is amazing

first time we went mid week we didnt have to queue as we went early and got a table by the window the restaurant was empty and quiet when we arrived but by the time we left it was full on the weekend it is so busy you get given a number then wait for your number to be called to get a table it is far noisier and service is a bit slower on the weekend but still fine

it also has very clean toilets which is a big plus if you have been walking around shanghai most of the day

it is a chain restaurant with many branches across the region and in other countries i did sit here and wonder why they do not have a branch in london i would be there all the time, i ate at the din tai fung here and then later on in the trip at the one in hong kong i think i made massive errors in ordering which was down to inexperience with dim sum the experience in hk was only made perfect because i was with an experienced customer who assisted me and my wife however please don�t confuse this into believing i had a negative experience at the shanghai dtf because it was anything but the service was excellent the restaurant was large and airy the food was still excellent if a little turned down in flavour i recommend the chicken and shrimp spring rolls i do not recommend the flavourless pork and shrimp wantons in noodle soup � this was only enjoyable after ample amounts of chillies were added in, i always take my out of town guests here to try a variety of dumplings and authentic chinese dishes they always are consistent in quality and freshness you can even watch them making the dumplings through a large window into the kitchen the menu is super easy to navigate and has pictures of each dish love them all, if you are looking for overpriced dim sums with a fairly great view of the bund then maybe this place is for you however after living in shanghai for over ten years you come to realize you should only dine at this place when you want to impress your friends who came to visit you from overseas i personally would choose the restaurant on the fourth floor since it also gives you a good view as you dine therefore i only use this place when i want to celebrate some special occasion but if you are only here for a short time maybe try it out the mini dumplings are a bit unusual so they are worth trying, din tai fung is a must if traveling to shanghai the best branch for me is the super brand mall simply because of the view you will get a delicious food with a perfect view of the bund, this is not the place for cheap meal the dumplings are very costly considering we can get the same quantity at a fraction of what we pay here

but

qualitywise you must try the ones here each dumpling while expensive is exquisitely made and delicate very delicious too

another item we like in here is the clear tasty chicken soup we combine that with noodles for a healthy guiltfree meal

ambience in this restaurant is bright and clean not bad for family meal or to entertain clients

if you dont mind the price its a good place to dine, to tell the truth your mainland friends will not want to eat at din tai fung but when dining out with foreigners or taiwanese this is one of your better choices the food is good the setting is pleasant and welllit without being too bright and the staff smile when they take your order","Mexican cuisine",0.999755757661771
90,"when you are in shanghai some of the expensive restaurants are not the places you want to go because the cuisine is too trditional chinese for our liking but paradise dynasty has a variety of menu items that are really good for those of us used to the chinese food in usa this is an excellent restaurant shrimpprawns in chili and tomato sauce was great they have a mix dumplings items where they serve eight different dumplings one each i did not like crab roe dumpling but the rest of them were great i went there in june 2016 and this time we went there twice, best soup dumplings the place is very nice located in the kids zone in the ifc shipping mall 3rd floor, this is a great place for dim sum  order lots of dishes and share the xialongbao dumplings come in many different flavors and the spicy peanut noodle soup is very good too this is similar to din tai fung but cheaper and frankly just as good, this a fairly new restaurant on level b2 of the shanghai tower the food was really good especially the soup dumplings and the green beans with pork and very reasonably priced service very good as with a lot of places in shanghai only local cards are accepted  no visa mastercard or amex, had lunch with some colleagues in this dim sum restaurant there was a good selection of excellent dim sum some spicy but all full of different flavors and according my colleagues mostly local shanghai cuisine there was a little wait but i think it was worth it the atmosphere in this place is also good you can come here for many occasions maybe not so much for romantic dinners but everything else will work, i love the shanghai soup dumplings and this is where i come every time im in shanghai to get them its great that there are a number of flavours the other food is good too but a little pricey , it is a sort of shanghai szechuan cantonese resto i found the food we ordered quite tasty flavorful and great value for money the restaurant has good patronage from the locals it is just located in a not so central area of shanghai, i ordered noodles with peanuts and fried vegetables noodles is spicy which i like while the vegetables is too oily i felt like eating oil than vegetables, great food and service you usually have to wait for a table but its well worth the wait the staff are very helpful and super efficient there is a good selection of food dumplings noodles sea food i think its very good value for money and would always search out if i am in the area , trying to decide what to have for lunch in this mall we saw the picture of the dim sums which turned out to be some special kind with 8 colors of dumplings the menu had an instruction on how to eat them which was very helpful and also in which order to eat them so the taste of the different one matched
before having the bamboo basket in we had a plate of their signature pork soup also with a kind of dumplings in as well we ordered two soups for two which in hindsight was overmuch should have done it the chinese way and splitted it into the smaller bowls at the table also had some steamed vegetables and salad rolls with sesame sauce
everything was really good and the dumplings were just heavenly definetely recommended , the place is hidden at the dead end of an alley they serve good local food there was always a line waiting to get in the restaurant is in the same mall where we were staying we went there three times in four days we tried many of their dishes we liked their food and service the place was also very clean, got here after shopping at shang xia wishing to try the eight colourful xiao long bao and their signature pork noodles soup the soup base is delicious but you can find better noodles opting for a scavenger hunt down dark alleyways in shanghai
the service is the one you would find in an average eatery but when the xiao long bao got eventually  they forgot my order served the culinary jorney started
eight dim sum each one having a different filling starting from the original through ginseng foie gras black truffles crab roe cheese garlic to sichuan pepper
i savor the dim sum variety and enjoyed particularly the crab roe the sichuan and the garlic filled dim sum, this was a gift from my son for mothers day he had eaten at this restaurant in three different cities in asia and loved it we had traveled to vietnam and returned through shanghai we arrived at 1100 am and proceeded to order the colorful dumplings scallion pastry steamed pork bun and chinese bun thoughts on all of them
chinese bun just the fluffy bread and sweet dipping sauce it wasnt bad but very boring
scallion pastry this was delicious great texture the pastry would fall apart in your mouth and was very crisp
steamed pork bun this was interesting the bottom portion was fried while the rest of it was steamed it was filled with soup like the dumplings but was huge a bit harder to eat but still delicious
colorful dumplings dont know the chinese name exactly but these were phenomenal you get 8 dumplings all different colors which allocate the fillings i dont remember all the fillings but the black truffle garlic original and foi gras were by far the best i could have eaten those all day
this place was so good that im going again for dinner tonight, the sichuan pepper chicken has a little cumin flavor and is quite nice dumplings are exceptional as are most all the dishes we tried like a cross between din tai fung and south beauty recommend you get a reservation as it can be a bit busy, excellent food and service highly recommended dont be shy easy english menu at par with ding tai fung try the peanut noodles and of course the dumplings, spent 6 months in shanghai and this was my favourite for dumplings and the peanut based soup wow my mouth waters every time i think about this place must try, this amazing place is hidden a bit next on one of the ifc mall floor you can get there great dumplings stuffed with whatever you want and my favorite spring bean with grained pork and chili prices are ok and the atmosphere is very nice, paradise dynasty is difficult to find tucked away at the end of a lane of kids shops on the 3rd floor of the ifc mall its worth seeking out this very industrial high volume establishment however for decent xiao long bao and other dumplings and a good range of other fare we enjoyed the lettuce bundles in sesame sauce and the excellent bitter gourd stirfried with xo sauce in addition to the multicoloured xiao long bao option and some panfried veggie dumplings very reasonably priced too but go early for lunch as its packed by 12 noon a good find , great xiao long bao as well as various noodles dumplings and shredded meat with pancakes didnt order so cant remember the names

im not a fan of sichuan spice numbing ma la flavours but the flavours of the noodles was just right and not overwhelming

btw this is the review for the iapm mall, modern clean tasteful interior
champion hero signature dish is multi coloured multi flavoured xia long bao
xia long bao tastes very good
other chinese staple dishes like sweet and sour pork pepper beef all good
convenient but slightly obscure part of the landmark ifc mall in pudong, food was not tasty at all yes except the xia long bao which was juicy and liquid in the mouth perhaps the best weve ever tried but the service kept watching their watches as we were in the late afternoon and i thought this is the way they were telling the guest to leave they charge chinese tea by head without asking if its ok which we thought was for free
maybe will buy some xia long bap to take away next time but never sit in, my friend took me to the one opened in iapm mall although i saw this 8 colored xiao long bao in hk advertisement awhile ago finally tried in shanghai very nice and yummy highly recommend must try we ordered other food as well like cold dish  spicy black mushroom worth to try all the food we ordered were delicious only one thing i have to say in shanghai or china every restaurant has many waiterswaitresses but you need to call them up then they come for service otherwise they are just busy lookingchecking their mobile phones instead of providing service to the customers, recently i have been eating a lot of xiao long bao i just love the thin dough skin the meat or shrimp mixture inside and of course the juice is the best part as iapm opened a year ago i have since seen a lot of advertising about the paradise dynasty restaurant opening after a long wait it has finally happened so naturally i had to try it the place is modern as iapm is very clean and well situated on the last floor near the imax cinema
the service is � well i don�t want to sound racist but chinese restaurant have a lot of things to do to improve their service paradise dynasty is a big brand who want to sound chicluxurous so the staff should be almost perfect instead of that they were lazy noisy talking to each other and laughing loudly not very active and we waited way too long for our order 30 minutes at least regardless we were there to try those famous xiao long bao the second surprise was that the prices are not that high although of course it�s expensive compared to the local small businesses that sell the xiao long bao baozi etc� but it�s really affordable 200 yuan for two being full and delighted at the end of the feast
now let�s talk about the xiao long bao 58 yuan for 8 firstofitskind types of xiao long bao such as the original ginseng foie gras black truffles crab roe cheese garlic and szechuan they are all really tasty and surprisingly taste as described the ingredients are probably genuine and not �flavoured� the cheesy xiao long bao and the black truffle are my favorites for those who want to try it it�s highly recommended if you have family or friends visiting and they are tired of the local dirty restaurant but delicious we all agree paradise dynasty is the perfect spot they have most of the traditional chineseshanghainese food for a nice price in a nice environment even if that local dirty shop really tastes better, even im a more meatsteak lover  you get hooked by these dumplings
i swear i cannot eat any dumplings somewhere else at least all get measured to these here
also all the other dishes are simply fantastic
make sure you have a reservation if you are more than 2 people this restaurant is always crowded, you must try their colorful dumplings each color has a different fragrancetaste and a different filling chicken to crab to all kind of other meat

heard that the place is always crowded and that speaks for itself must try, located in the ifc mall on the 3rd floor this well crowded place serves great dim sum and ramen

unfortunately none of the employees speak english so hand gestures will get handy however the menu is in english along with photos to make it easier to order

price average is 140 rmb 20 euros per person and you get a fair deal of food

i recommend the sweet and sour chicken beef with black bean sauce shrimps with tomato sauce and fried rice

attached photos, loved the colorful dumplings surely a unique experience if you take a picture of your food and post it on wechat chinese whatsapp and show it to the waitress you will get complimentary durian dumplings, nice spin to the traditional dish taster of all the unique flavours was a real treat they even recommend the order to eat them to get the best taste experience awesome that its located right outside the ifc residential, i think these dumplings are the best ever had in china better than din tai fung they always have promotion buy 1 get 2 really worthy one minus almost no one staff speaks english, great chinese food and found it relatively affordable servers also know how to speak in english i suggest this restaurant if you have friends visiting in shanghai, the food here is very typical chinese and authentic clean and modern restaurant with good service they almost dont speak english but the menu does p favorite dumplings xao long bao 10 different flavors love it also has nice views, what drew us here was the 8 coloured flavoured xiao long baos since we each wanted to try every flavour we ordered one basket each while i found that the original one was not as good as jia jia tang baos the black truffle and ginseng ones were so good
we ordered many other dishes and they all tasted amazing the sai pang xie and the noodles with chicken soup are must tries
this is my new favourite restaurant in shanghai cant wait to go back, the food was quite different and taste good but the was not so ideal since its over the end of the alley with no people passing by and have to locate for it, while living in shanghai we enjoyed xiao long bao soup dumplings  la mian pulled noodles quite often we tried many different places but paradise dynasty was by far our favorite we left shanghai soon after they opened but managed to have it twice  we miss their food so much in addition to the xlb  noodles we also had their pan fried dumplings all the food was excellent as well as the service give them a try you wont be disappointed","dumpling restaurant",0.605317591668201
91,"this restaurant has been around for a long time when i came 8 years ago  it was really good

recently went back with a bunch of colleagues the decoration was the same as before the food quality was better i thought

we had our own private room so quite quiet service was ok not too bad nothing to write home about

not sure how much it costed but i would hope not excessively expensive

decent but nothing that would suggest i shd go back, brought here by locals that new we were looking for local cuisine the place was just ok and food and service also just ok wouldnt come back, plenty of fish prawns noodles and rice with the prawns being the stand out dish duck in pancake rolls was ok with remainder of duck was brought chopped up in a sauce great fun for four of us at about <u+00a3>35head, this place recommended by four seasons concierge i wonder why does he get kickback cant think of any other reason service is beyond terrible lots of staff standing around doing nothing no business repeated calls to clueless manager needed to get anything done vastly overptriced and poor thought out wine list food is average at best overpriced no wonder they rely on touts to bring in the fee customers unlucky enough to land there, the place is very nice trendy fancy good elegant style not overdone still cosy and friendly the menu has pictures top vote there the food is good big portions so order little and add to it
the service really needs improvement 3 of the dishes we ordered were not delivered luck because we already had so much food but still we received the check 3 times without asking for it the waiter brought us coffee instead of fruit we pointed on the menu what we wanted and then got upset
it was a bit expensive but again we ordered far too much food 1 meat dish is good for 3 people to share, have been several times over the years we lived in china they have very nice private rooms even a small bar at the front good dim sum lunches and good local food dishes for dinner very nice atmosphere  western toilets, i am jaded by many years of delicious meal experiences in china so read this with that in mind lynn was very reasonable in price by us standards  $30person with a bottle of good french wine the lamb stands out as particularly delicious the stewed egg could have done with a little bit more of the caviar so one could actually taste it and the cabbage roll was too salty but an enjoyable experience overall the atmosphere is dark handsome and calming and that adds to the experience that made this an enjoyable evening, lynn is my favourite shanghai eatery i stumbled on this place about 5 years ago and it is now an absolute must every time i visit shanghai
their modern take on shanghai cuisine offers many options and there is sure to be something to please everyone
the service is exceptional while not being over bearing ad the decor and fittings make it great for a quiet meal
always consistent an value for money, the entrance of the lynn sets the tone  this is not your regular shanghai eating place the restaurant itself is quite spectacular with high ceiling dim lighting aligned rows of tables staffers in black and white uniforms
the menu comes with plenty of pictures that makes you mouth water one page after the other in spite of its highend look the lynn is reasonably priced
for food our lot of 3 ordered spicy eggplants tofu with veggies crispy duck with white buns crab foie gras a must try and some more veggies all in all this was a pleasant dinner in a quiet atmosphere for business dinners there is a private room on the right next to the entrance
if i have to find a flaw it would be the fact that tables are too close to one another to my liking this is a fine dining restaurant after all, lynn is an important culinary stop in shanghai to eat highend culinary local shanghanese food with a array of choices and of various vegetables fish meats and many other special dishes
the place is certainly designed for tourist yet many local chinese come too as the food regardless what you choose is always good
it is now over 10 years that i visit this restaurant and eventhough the turnover of waters is high their training is good allowing a very good and friendly service
if you are not familiar with the real chinese food and want to get your pallet accustomed to an easier chinese cuisine to start with lynn is the place for you, +nice decoration and atmosphere
+extensive menu
+very delicious food
+value for money given the quality of food

only ordered 3 dishes and all are exceptional
1 fish head and hairy crab soup
2 lobster fried rice
3 cold tofu with century egg

will definitely be back to try other dishes, i went there with couple of friends for their dimsum deal on weekend for 98 rmb it was really worth the price they have good selection of hongkongs style dimsum from noodle rice usual dismsum stuffs roast meat dessert etc we pretty much order everything on the menu it was very tasty and yummy
my favorite was their shanghai spring roll altough one of my friend doesnt like it the eggyolk custart bun charsiu bun and everything on dessert section
this restaurant is sitting on xikang road just at the back of portman ritzcarlton hotel on nanjing west road i would advise to come early as this deal ends at 2pm, the biggest challenge with this place was trying to find it somehow less well known and not on strip with other eateries food was excellent including truffle and mushroom dim sum  service very good and interesting modern ambiance it was strangely deserted however, my first shanghainese fusion food impressed with its setting and how the food was presented during my first trip to shanghai

it obviously cater to expat crowd but i must say i like the ambiance and the plating of the food a typical chinese food but serve in western style, i celebrated my birthday at this restaurant excellent upscale chinese contemporary food in a beautiful somewhat trendy environment prices were very fair the wine list decent will definitely come back, wed been recommended lynn as a slightly upmarket experience of shanghai food we most ate in more ordinary places but wanted to try a different atmosphere and to see what else could be done with shanghai cuisine we werent disappointed lynn is easy to teach on foot from peoples square  a halfhour walk along west nanjing road starting with the most elegant shops in the city and then changing gear

the restaurant is a place to relax over a meal and other tables were mostly chinese diners taking their time though its clearly also popular with visitors to the city the ambience is attractive the service attentive  i wouldnt have wanted every meal in shanghai to have been in such a setting but it was very enjoyable the prices were very reasonable for such a place we had a spectacularly good crispy eel as starter  shredded eel deepfriedin a wonderful sweet and spicy coating then excellent chicken with eggplant wed gone for different dishes  id chosen chicken with peanuts and chillies only to find that it was chillies with chicken and peanuts and the chillies were not only plentiful but also particularly powerful my fault i shouldnt have taken the risk and i had to order a second plate of what my wife was eating which arrived quickly

all in all a restaurant id thoroughly recommend if you want something a little special in shanghai but take care when it comes to the chillies, lynn has a fresh take on classic shanghai food each dish is well balanced to bring out the maximum flavor we enjoyed the seafood hot and sour soup highly spiced take on the classic the mushroom dumplings were woody and flavorful a sizzling rice seafood dish varied from the classic sweet sauce with a subtle wine sauce and the most amazing prawns with cashews and chiles will never live up to description all of us gasped after the first bite into the large split fleshy prawns surrounded by perfect supporting sauce there was a moment there when all of us at the table shared a transcendental moment
all in a contemporary atmosphere is it expensive not as much as the places on the bund and the food is so original its hard to put a price on it didnt go crazy with drinks and the meal came to 480 yuan for three, delicious food shanghai duck sauteed prawns with mustardwassabi sauce especially nice location but the service could use a bit of training we kerp coming back one of my absolute shanghai favourites good to take visitors as it is a kind of chinese cuisine which you rarely if even get outside shanghai, lynns was our favorite chinese restaurant in shanghai the look of the place is not particularly chinese the big art on the wall is rather modern but the food is great and overall it has a good vibe the dishes were not oily or fatty the fish had was excellent as were the diced chicken pockets in fact we liked all the dishes we ordered and the service was decent its a modern environment for modern chinese food, periodically i go to this restaurant that is located in the same building of the ritzcarlton portman hotel but the entrance is external
i had sweet sour pork soups fried noodles and other dishes most of them were very good if you dont like spicy food you should make sure what you order is not spicy
i do not recommend dumplings that are not as good as in other specialized restaurants
the service was thorough, a treat  a western focussed but authentic restaurant a treat to find a menu in english as well as chinese and a decent wine list my friends and i feasted on many delicacies  knowing what we were eating and accompanied by some half decent wine food was delicious and staff helpful and efficient, formal restaurant in a very chic area service is excellent as well as the food and the atmosphere highly recommended, went here for a business dinner they have great wine options and the food is delicious def have the wasabi flavoured prawns and the pork belly, located near shanghai center  very popular among nonchinese
great local dishes dongpo pork is the best brown meat tofu is also great
some dim sum dishes are also good, on saturdays and sundays you can eat as much of this delicious modern shanghai food as you can manageand all for 100 rmb this is a steal compared to the weekday a la carte prices the space is clean and modern and the ordering is simplejust mark what you want on a paper menu with pictures they bring small plate versions of each item so you can sample a plethora of items we really liked everything we ate it helped to have a local with us who explained each food item, i came here for a business lunch with a dozen of my colleagues the food was very good and we had a large variety of local dishes portions were not too large so we did not have much wasted i thought the decor was quite elegant and would recommend this for a nice date or a social gathering for adults although i think this would be fine for older children i thought it would not be ideal for young kids, great restaurant to relax and enjoy some great food the prawns cooked in egg white and the chicken with chillis were amazing the service was very good and even though we were the last people in the restaurant they did not make us feel rushed, the restaurant is ideal for both business diners and travelers who want to get a good taste of modern chinese cuisine i ordered the famous duck which was amazingly delicious their other chinese dishes are very well cooked with balanced taste its bit pricy but it worh the money, lynn was a treat to the palate the food was fabulous the ambience very nice modern decor and the service was great my favorite eating experience in shanghai and best chinese food ever, the staff very kindly accepted to take us despite the relatively late hour quite a modern place with very good staff the ability to speak english was variable and fortunately there were a lot of photos of what they served on a very long menu the food varied from incredibly delicious lamb shank pancakes crispy duck and sauteed shrimp to rather dull vegetable dumplings, the 88rmb weekend dim sum menu is excellent value and the food is good quality and delicious popular with both locals and foreigners i did have a booking arrived early and was accommodated but i did make a point of arriving close to opening time approx 1100 am i was seated at a front table for four and once seated the waiter cleared away the excess placements i was initially provide with the a la carte menu but as i was aware of the dim sum menu requested it there are a few staff members who can communicate well enough in english ordering was done by marking on the englishchinese menu you can order more progressively as you eat

the service was excellent staff kept a close eye and removed empty dishes replenished tea with hot water tidied etc when one of the waiters noticed my handbag on the floor he brought a little stool out for it to sit on so cute the space is a modern restaurant dining area i was escorted to and from the bathroom it got busy vey quickly recommend to book in advance especially if going in the weekends
the dim sums were very good and huge variety to choose from from a green salad to shui mai to prawn dumplings to desserts the lynn fried noodles were the only disappointment of all my dishes i loved all the other dishes especially the fresh tofu wrapped vegetable rolls, after first visiting the place in 2009 we always wanted to come back there which we did in june this year as the title says  the restaurant provides a unique romantic setting great food shanghai crispy duck is still my favourite, nice modern and clean atmosphere in this huge place volume is impressive reservation is better although not mandatory the menu is comprehensive and there is plenty to chose even from 2 business lunch it is one of those place you can have an elegant and tasty chinese dinner at a reasonnable price although not cheap service is excellent and attentive, theres a lot of fuss about lynn what i liked was that the setting is beautiful tables are nicely spaced service is excellent so it makes a great setting for conversation business meal or catching up with friends the food is good just that nothing amazing wowing or happily surprising so all in a all a reliable place, lynn is not a cheap restaurant by shanghai standards if you want cheap go elsewhere that said the food we ordered was extremely tasty and we enjoyed our meal we had lemon chicken which was beautifully crispy and perfectly cooked and the pork belly also incredible if a little rich for our tastes wine is expensive here but thats what weve experienced elsewhere in shanghai

service was above average which is saying something our experience in shanghai has been of great service they even have hot towels for when you arrive

overall a great experience if a little too oriented towards a western crowd for our liking, were a group of 7 people visited lynn yesterday for dinner the deco and atmosphere there were modern and nice we have a table at the corner with privacy we ordered 9 dishes theyre all yummy as they are modern shanghai restaurant the dishes are not as oily as those traditional restaurants desserts are also good the chef reduced sweetness we will come back for sure, the food here is a modern take on shanghai food and they have succeeded for the most part dishes are well presented and flavours are wellbalanced i would say this is a good place for at least one meal while you are in shanghai, the food was good to above average the wine cooked beef tendon was very well flavored the bean curd crab dish was also good the lamb wrap was also very tender and full of flavor though i didnt like the shanghai roast duck  and the desert wasnt very sweet not tasty, a must try especially if you have a weekend in shanghai
on sat and sun only  set priced menu for all you can eat with a wide and delicious selection of appertisers hot and cold mains noodles soups and desserts all for rbm 88 per head they charge for drinks at around rbm10 per head  a small price considering restaurantscafes in the area charge about rbm 4060 per drink

on weekdays a la carte menu dinning which again serves up a delicious selection of local shanghainese cuisine i have been to this place several times and each time the quality of the food is great

do book ahead on the weekend as it is pretty busy, this chinese restaurant near the portman ritz carlton has a great menu
an amazing selection of fresh seafood some of it prepared near your table
you can feel the freshness of the seafood on every bite
the peking duck was also very good and was rapped for us
the service was superb as well and they have great wine selection
the design of the restaurant is very moderen and i liked it, we went for this restaurant as it had some good reviews  what a mistake they have a large menu so we took ti e to order eight of the dishes we chose were out of stock as it was getting farcical  we asked the waiter to tell us what was in stock no chicken of any sort no pumpkin ect we chose an eel and a beef dish they were very average we have had better chinese meals in england we had hopes for the peking duck but that was terrible dont waste your time or money, we were a bit disappointed with other chinese restaurants in shanghai but we really enjoyed lynn its not a particularly chinese looking restaurant in fact i would describe it as quite modern looking inside its good nice high ceilings and its quite dimly lit at night its a very clean restaurant with good friendly service the food was not too oily or fatty unlike some of the other chinese restaurants we had in china the food tasted fresh and healthy we liked the salmon and avocado although we dont see how that is at all chinese the spicy and sweet fish was really good as was the crispy chicken our waiters were quite friendly whenever we called they would refer to another waiter who was probably the only one who could speak english in the entire place it was a bit funny we would definitely recommend lynn especially after being disappointed by chinese food at other restaurants, nice place with pretty intersting dishes from various inspirations wine list is eshaustive as well, lovely interior with sophisticated lighting and semiromantic atmosphere though i was there on business excellent selection and items we ordered were delicious portions not enormous so three choices for two of us were fine highly recommended great location, we have just been to this restaurant having read the overall good viewsreally disappointed average food and terrible service the staff doesnt speak much english fair enough but the restaurant is obviously targeting foreign clientele you have to get their attention to order the food or you just can spend the whole evening waiting for then to come and take your order the food is delivered with 10 minutes gap between dishes the rice served possibly as dessert since it came after we had finished dinner we canceled and they didnt charge and then we had three desserts that we thought to be complimentary because we hadnt ordered them but they were added to our bill there are plenty of less expensive restaurants in shanghai with better food, lynn modern shanghai cuisine is a sleek restaurant with an extensive menu in english and chinese serving excellent cuisine at modest prices there is something for everyone fish chicken pork beef and vegetables the preparation of each of the dishes ordered was to our taste not too spicy but very tasty the presentation of each dish made our mouths water even before we took the first bite service is observant without fawning overall this is a restaurant to return to over and over again as so many of its patrons seemed to be doing clientele was upscale with many smartly dressed men and women of many races although blue jeans were perfectly acceptable located in excellent neighborhood just off nanjing road","Italian cuisine",0.998381180813252
92,"i went with my a colleague whos a local guy born and bred in shanghai this is a a place he called a little bit localized to accommodate foreigners but it is very close to authentic cuisine

we tried the braised pork with garlic and the fried fish with its sweet sour sauce the pork was probably the best i ever had and its one of my favorite dish

in addition to the cooking which is great the place has a nice atmosphere quiet and stylish

you cant go wrong with this place, we had one night in shanghai abd this being our first visit wanted to make the most of it after having lunch at a small restaurant where our food turned out to have been cooked in the alley ye shanghai and the general area xintiandi had been recommended by our hotel concierge we were the only big noses at ye shanghai and only one or two personnel had much english so that makes me feel the place was a place visited by locals which is key for us the menu did have photos and basic descriptions in english as well we had the starter shanghai spareribs and dumplings both were excellent the dumplings melted in our mouthsi had been searching for dumplings all day and they are not as easy to find in the street as one would think the spareribs were served cold the waiter had warned us and had a wonderful flavor for main courses we had the mixed meat and vegetables and eggplant and pork again both were excellent the portions are not huge as in western restaurants but plentiful the wine list was also good with nice interesting and reasonable options $30bottle the service was very attentive we did need to ask for rice it wasnt indicated separately on the menu so we assumed the main courses come with rice but they didnt as we dont know the traditions in shanghai we just were fine with asking for rice initially i was put off by the menu as everything at the front was very expensive mainly seafood but the back of the menu had reasonable prices we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the restaurant we did need a cab back to the bund after walking to the restaurant and they tried to call one for us but after we waited a about 10 minutes they couldnt get one we easily found one on the street about a block away also the plum candy on your way out is very nice, dreadful food dreadful place dreadful service we hated itmenu was horrible food nothing like the photographseverything was extra and lots fried too much with pork, it used to be one of my top eats when it opened and still sometimes is due to a very decent environment designer friendly its top location and still shouting glamour ok the food has suffered a little in the last few years due to personally l think to the lack of creativity in the dishes they do change depending on season l do like the fact that l know what l am getting is decent and the quality is standard so good but not great, good chinese food in touristy xintiandi everything was excellent and very good service balanced in price and very kind staff good recomendation the place is clean and very well decorated, went for dinner with my wife for my birthday we were very disappointed with the service the food is good but too expensive for what we expected
the main dish came first without the rice and side dish then came the starter after 1520min the rice arrived but the main dish was already cold

resto qui pete plus haut que son cul, after a day of disappointing eats in shanghai and a tiring day of touring it was great to have a meal in a place with ambience and good food the mapo bean curd was heavenly and so was the french beans wished they had more duck in the order food was heartwarmingly delicious great end to a long day, ye shanghai were very good the last time i visited but theyve gotten even better the four of us went for dinner recently and were equally impressed by the courteous service the great atmosphere and setting a talented pianist on a grand and an accompanying local singer and very important the standard of the dishes wed ordered everything tasted delicious, we had walked past this place the day before it looked good so we booked we then spoke with an expat working in shanghai and he said we had selected well and we would enjoy it he was correct

apart from being a bit dark the evening was good good staff and good food plus importantly very clean bathrooms  always a good sign

good food  i particularly liked the camphor smoked duck, all was great fantastic from the beginning to the end of our dinner located on the french concession area it was easier to access than i could imagine no traffic no problems at all easy to reach
we got a menu with english version and out host helped us by choosing some of the dishes all served on a chinese style in a round center table i personally chose the deep fried yellow fish a dish that i first ate in beijing and it didnt disappointed delicious and the star of the dinner but all dishes were just perfect the pork dumpling eggplants spring roll and the second best of the night giant shrimps on a chili sauce
servers were fantastic and food came extremely fast to our table
i strongly recommend ye shanghai if you spend at least one evening in the city, the prawn dumplings and shanghai style pork dumplings are delicious also try the fresh water river shrimp doufu soup with salted pork and mushroom and bamboo was delicious as were the beans with bamboo shoots, i would definately recommend this restaurant located in the restaurant area xintiandi well made chinese dishes from good ingredients, so this place is in xintiandi and that is very nice we come up into a old colonial building with a little dim red lights there is a window with lots of trees so it feels like we could be in french food was delicious  we had appetisers and mains for the appetiser the 18 vegetable treasures was amazingly fresh and nice hangzhou duck had a special tea taste for the mains we had the seafood bisque which was delicious and crab meat toufu which was good all in all it was a very good night, okheres the deal on this place out of this world stellar food but small portions great great service atmosphere and food just know what to expect it is my favorite in sh one of my favorite in all of china we had green beans with bamboo shanghai style pork belly dumplings and the sweet and sour fish is to die for they also gave us free ice cream we ordered a glutinous rice ball with red bean that was the only one that we werent over the moon aboutbut great place my compliments to the chef, we came here on a sunday evening partly on the recommendation of our hotel concierge we were seated upstairs where there was a pianist and singer later in the evening we ordered wine to drink and a dim sum basket with shrimp pork and spinach dumplings we really enjoyed the chicken and pine nuts in a crispy sesame seed hollow bun our green beans with bamboo shoots and the sticky rice with pork and sweet potato that was baked in a bamboo stalk the piano player began to play american standard songs like carolina moon and the shadow of your smile the singer joined him later and she was very good too our only issue was that one of my companions was allergic to shrimp and although she showed our waiter that information written in chinese we found the shrimp dumplings in the dim sum basket we found that out before she ate them however so all was well, this restaurant in xintiandi is a must for the ones who want to taste real shanghainese food in a typical atmosphere the place is elegant and the food spectacular definetely suggested, the restaurant offers a large selection of dishes but the ones we tasted had very little flavor the drunken chicken appetizer was good the octopus very bland and the braised pork belly was good service was very attentive nothing special and fairly expensive for the offerings, a friend of us was visiting and wanted to try some shanghainese food he picked this restaurant due to proximity to his hotel and also some good reviews the servers do not speak english and they didnt have all dishes available the food was not very tasty and the server was not very friendly we would pick another shanghainese restaurant for guests next time, if you are looking for traditional chinese food stop looking the peking duck is stunning and wrapped for you at the table staff is super friendly and prices are reasonable, the location is very nice in the heart of xintiandi the food is very good but its not as sweet as other shanghainese cuisine, nah just really nah the price isnt worth it the staff is terrible how dare they charge you 10 for staff ive been used to shanghais hospitable atmosphere but this restaurant is horrible the food is ok  but really not top notch or even close to what youre paying for  but the staff you couldve put them at mcdonalds and theyd be under serving their consumer bad, recommend this place for shanghai cuisine the place is very nice in a renovated shikumen house drunken chicken baked rice in bamboo tube and xiaolongbao were all very good
from xintiandi subway station walk up huangpi south road and it will be on the left, good dim sum options at reasonable price quality good service slow venue quite nice and comfortable good restaurant for bring guest and business lunch, the duck skin dish was really terrific as were the green beans all around the best meal we had in shanghai, had dinner here on a friday evening

loved loved loved loved loved it

from the location to the ambience to the service to the quality of the food i simply cannot fault anything with this venue

great for business or a romantic evening not so good for families with young children

reservations are a must especially for weekends, located in the xintiandifrench quarter this is a modern chic restaurant rather than authentic old chinese food and service was good and relative value ok there seems to be two sections upstairs  the larger area for locals and the smaller area at the front for those brought by private tour guides as we were
one surprise was the availability of good wine by the glass they opened a new bottle for us so no issues with freshness
very clean western toilets are always a plus, very pretty and elegant restaurant in the xintiandi area just across from the andaz and next to godiva and maurya fancy szechuan place easy to find the menu is foreigner friendly and our dinner could not have been more delicious and better balanced friendly service too for apps we chose braised duck hangzhou style and steamed pork buns for mains the mapo tofu wo crab prawns in sweet spicy sauce and dan dan noodles we washed it down with the special merlot from columbia crest half price afterwards its fun to walk out back in the trendy square starbucks and haagen daz are good after dinner stops, attended ye shanghai for dim sum earlier this week and thoroughly loved the entire experience the prawn wonton soup was the spiciest ive ever had and thought it was excellent their xiaolongbao is above average and su mai was great

the venue is in xintiandi and is worth visiting as well you can have a great daytime or evening experience at the restaurant and then walk the neighborhood afterwards

highly recommended, this was my 1st visit here food was excellent and unique with local twists added it wasnt oily nor too salty the ma po dou fu  beef with scallion were most impressive and dim sum was generally all good except for spring roll loved the interior design too so do visit upstairs as well, very cool renovation of an old structure we had a private room that was a nice twist staff was very attentive food was good and they had a nice selection that was not too spicey, in an ancient chinese decor the food and service are excellent must book in advance you may find several different courses of hunan cuisine refined and worth going, the restaurant is beautiful set in a shikumen house gorgeously lit very serene however we had better food at places like jishi the service while attentive was odd all of our courses came at once and very quickly and we had to ask repeatedly and wait quite awhile for bottled water also i ordered a cocktail when we sat down and a bottle of wine with dinner the wine came first before the food and the cocktail came after the food so the meal was out of order and kind of rushed i would go here for a special occasion just for the decor but if its great shanghai style food youre after id cold to jishi or similar, we had lunch at ye shanghai on a saturday the restaurant is located in the french concession surrounded by trendy shops and restaurants weve heard the restaurant is famous fortunately they were able to seat us for lunch without a reservation

the decor is clean and crisp with starched linen tablecloths we ordered the unlimited dim sum lunch for about 138 rmb about $2100 including a glass of sparking wine or juice tea was also included and topped up continuously

the dim sum was excellent my wife and i ordered three or four selections at a time the steamed shrimp steamed vegetable and steamed pork dumplings were excellent we liked every single thing we ordered service was not rushed

its a great value at a well regarded restaurant in a trendy part of town

the only negative was the language barrier we needed to point to items when ordering which is not a big deal however we couldnt ask for advice or descriptions, we enjoyed a range of fish and vegetable dishes each with its own subtle and distinctive flavour highlights were stuffed soft shell crab chinese yam and the smoked fish

the service was helpful and efficient and the ambiance calm and comfortable, like typical higherend shanghai restaurants ye shanghai has nice comfortable setting great food and high price tag the menu options were great service is ok the dishes we had were delicious it is definitely a nice place to bring friends over and have a great time while i enjoyed my experience here i have had equallydelicious food in other places in shanghai with 25 of the cost, food was excellent and service was just right good business lunch will be back for dinner
dumplings were my favorite and large shrimp were fresh tastings, great place to have some traditional shanghai cuisine the ambiance is nice great and convenient location and great service, had the hairy crab with the vinegar and yellow wine top class and other dishes were all very balanced and cooked to perfection my guests commented that despite the restaurant was full it was easy for us at the table to have a good conversation we think its because of the high ceiling and maybe sound proofing, an upmarket chic restaurant serving tasty food in rather modest portions the place has a nice buzz to it and the service was very good despite being in the rather touristic xintiandi district ye shanghai seems to attract a mainly chinese crowd who may of course also be tourists rather than expats or western tourists as another reviewer has noted there is a live singing act upstairs while on the ground floor the atmosphere is more intimate where there is a choice of tables or booths definitely worth a visit, went there as part of a big group and we had a set dinner  the food was tasty and well presented

downstairs is more intimate and the upstairs is large with music

the restaurant is well located amongst many other restaurants, went here for late dinner food was excellent and great service in a stylish setting prices reasonable and easy to order for our nonchinese speaking family highly recommend, my friend had booked us the hairy crab set meal online which was quite different to the one on the set menu in the restauranta lot more crab on it and the food was very good and there was a lot of it

the restaurant is very nice and we were given a booth and had really good service the wine list was great and had a good selection of wine by the glass as well as by the bottle

i would definately return to try the rest of the menu which looked very inviting

lovely ambience nice service and great food would highly recommend especially in hairy crab season, ye shanghai was great from start to finish tables upstairs were nicely set out with most either along the windows or overlooking the grand piano halfway up the wide stairway the place has atmosphere which should appeal to all types of clientele  couples business groups friends or families our family outing certainly enjoyed it

of the dishes we tried the tofu for entree was a bit dry on its own but went well when dipped in the chinese vinegar sauce salmon sushi avocado with sesame seeds was delicious and the capsicum and mushroom salad great too very fresh and crunchy bean curd clay pot melts in your mouth with a delicate but clear flavour crabs were a bit expensive but tasted nice perhaps more for the international guests the sweet and sour pork was nice not too saucy the onion was crunchy but a tad undercooked noodles were not too heavy or strong  perfect with the sesame oil and seaweed strands added just the right tang

the service and pianistsinger on show during our dinner was excellent for us the pricing was well worth it will definitely return, ye shanghai is an excellent very upscale chinese restaurant in xintiandi one of the trendiest eating and shopping districts of shanghai the restaurant itself is very beautiful with great atmosphere there was a live piano player and a very talented female singer service was excellent and not rushed the menu was extensive with a very good selection of starters and main dishes meats poultry and seafood ranging from simple dishes to the exotic of greatest importance the food was excellently prepared and absolutely delicious this is one of the best restaurants in shanghai, have been for lunch three times in recent months to this old favourite and found that its more than holding its own in terms of quality and consistency although we usually run away from all you can eat type offers the saturday dim sum plus lunch offers excellent value without in any way compromising quality

all our favourite shanghai cold appetisers were there plus great hot dim sum standards like turnip cake onion pancake and additional plates of beef with scallions stirfried pea shoots and shanghai fried noodles really hit the spot

draft kirin beer and beijings excellent yanjing are welcome on the list of beers as we are no friend of tsingtao and budweiser judging by a neighbouring japanese couple who polished off a bottle of champagne and then worked their way through a bottle of chardonnay on a warm and sticky day the wine list must deserve serious consideration too , the reason i say that is that it might not all arrive perhaps im being a bit harsh but we were taken to this restaurant for sunday brunch by our local guide it was a set price as much as you wanted to eat 108 yuan very reasonable i thought the guide ordered a number of dishes for us and at first they came out from the kitchen quite rapidly then they stopped and we hadnt had everything she had ordered we ordered a couple more dishes and again half of them turned up
on a more positive note the food that did arrive was fantastic we tasted steamed pork buns wontons fried beef pancakes minced duck with snow cabbage spring onion cakes and hong kong style spring rolls there was as much jasmine tea as you could drink and a clean western style toilet for when you had
if only the service had been better id have given this place full marks, restaurant good situated near shops and attractions friendly staff but kind of unsure with foreign visitors peking duck was ok dumplings and springrolls tasty nice live music its a fair restaurant chinese seem to like it, having dined in ye shanghai in hong kong at pacific place when we saw it in shanghai xintiandi we decided to try it we managed to get a table on a saturday night without a booking at 1730

we were seated on the second floor which was lovely the decor was quite dark and nicer than in hk we ate our favorites  chicken soup fried bean curd entree river prawns and cabbage with ham for dessert we ate the egg white with banana and red bean pancake and the mango sago cream the food came quickly the seafood dishes are not cheap but the other dishes were reasonably priced we enjoyed the dinner more than in hk which i rated a 4 due to the decor, our favorite restaurant in china
crabs noodles drinks lovely atmosphere inside and out
highly recommend, very good traditional shanghai cuisine nice place ciao not too crowded or noisy like usually in the region even romantic atmosphere decent prices and friendly waiters place nicely decorated with retro chinesse style live music on weekend nights","Italian cuisine",0.999717130439268
93,"must try the burratta tartare steakall is
excellent one of the top restaurant in shanghai you can feel the vibe definitely not a boring spot, is one of our favorite restaurants in shanghai we love the taste of meat grilled in the josper charcoal oven the blue lobster rice beef tartar the burrata cheese the tiradito and the most important the unbeatable friendly environment chef juan is the best host for a wonderful night dont hesitate if you are looking for a relaxing place with best food, great steak very good wine hard to find good reasonably priced steak in china very friendly staff we had the cheese plate asparagus yellow tail and steak terrific meal i will return, the restaurant is upstairs and is not that big with a long bar table we were quite early 730 and the restaurant only had a few customers we decide to sit at the bar and were greeted by great smiles and offers to drink from the other side

a gentleman 2 seats down working with a notebook heard us ask about cuts available and asked what we liked we explained we liked more meaty flavoured cuts vs just very tender meat he said hell look after us turned off his notebook and went into the kitchen we left it at that and ordered our steak tartar and wine

the tartar was quite good my mate found it perfect to his taste i prefer a bit more onion in mine next time we know

then came the steak it looked perfectly cook as per our specified temperature medium rare outside perfectly charred and inside pink and juicy first and subsequent bites did not disappoint it was an excellent piece of steak and i am happy to report the animal did not die in vain

on leaving we discovered the gent we spoke to is the ownerchef and he invited us into the kitchen to show off his oven this thing was imported from spain and burnt on wood and charcoal with internal temperature running up to +300�c no wonder it was so tasty

we left about 930 and by that time the place was packed chockablock

well be back, i was invited to raw by a work colleague and liked it so much i went back again the next night probably the best meal i have ever had in shanghai i have been going there since 1995 i give this my best recommendation, once again went there for a team diner
everything perfect from the welcome of juan and jon to the best meat in town
some amazing wines to discover, repeat visit to this favourite eatery in shanghai great food so tasty and creative nice atmosphere and great staff and chef keep it up well be back definitely recommend it if you are hungry for juicy meat, we were here for dinner with some friends they recommended the restaurant already we went there the first time but we agree its a really nice place even if it tooks a long time since we got our foodgreat meat and also the starter are delicious we also enjoyed some good wine
if you have some time have a visit at the bar below they have a big selection of any kind of alcohol and make special cocktails be aware of the barkeeper you could get wet if you are standing directly at the bar , i had best new year dinner before party at raw their seafood was delicious for an affordable price and best quality champagne 
i have also been for their brunch and love their foie gras and beef tartar, a great restaurant to have dinner in the environment is quiet and cozy the staff is gently and taking care of all the details at all time the food was all amazing and the meat is a must always coming back, its not a cheap place but quality is superb
nice and friendly staff willing to please at any time
wide range of food meat cooked on wood grill is simply amazing try also some hamburger you will definitely enjoy it
popular among expats located in a calm area of sh
was already few times a restaurant i always go when i am in sh, finally a restaurant in jingan area which is just great everything clicks from interior food wine list meat crowdi love coming here and so far the food and the service have been so consistent which is very surprising for shanghai where restaurants tend to get worse in a matter of months
but raw is just great meat any meat in any form was just outstanding
what i also love is the way they do the fusion of south american dishes with mediterranean touches nice job
i keep sending all my friends here who crave for fulfilling dinner made with high quality ingredients and superb meat, sunny sunday  delicious brunch at raw their brunch menu is heaven me and my friend tried beef tartar rouge foie gras and with a glass of wine
my sunday couldnt be any better after that meal and relaxing contemporary ambiance of raw restaurant, we tried several starters and mains all delicious the burrata the tartare the asparagus with trufe the foie the meat is a must tasty mouthwatering we have to wait a while for our table and they treat us with a drink good service and good atmosphere we will come back for sure, wow simply great casual atmosphere imported ingredients good wine list just great for a nice dinner with friends owner comes to the table even though the place was busy and confirmed the order and added recommendations food was fantastic, i visited raw during their softopening and had a good experience the service was great the food was great and the atmosphere has a nice balance between nice and casual but their main thing is steak and im not really a steakguy i had a visitor in town from texas and this is a guy who can talk all day long about different cuts of meat etc anyways long story short he was impressed what more can i say, the tenderloin was excellent well cooked and flavorful sides were decent potatoes and cauliflower would get the potatoes again but maybe not the cauliflower good wine and great goat cheese salad will return, being a foodie i am someone that is quite picky when this risotto arrived at my table it was jawdropping the risotto was cooked to perfection  adante but slightly softer to fit the chinese and the lobster was fresh i had stomach flu for 2 months since living in shanghai so what i eat i am very careful my stomach tells it all when something is not fresh the wagyu beef with mash was also amazing the aroma and flavour was extrodinary the beef tartar was presented really well in their own container and ice very chic and fresh they use farmranged raw egg so it is very safe to eat in china loved everything  if i had to say something bad the dessert was not as amazing as the main courses but good enough must try if you are in shanghai, i went back to my favourite spanish restaurant once i heard they are back with a new brunch menu on weekend they started serving first their delicious bread basket followed by super tasty eggs cooked at 63 degrees and drinks yummy weekend thanks to raw, ive been there several times and it has become one of my favorite restaurant in town

everything is simply excellent and the owner is also very cool which makes it even a better place to go, i think ive never had such a great experience anywhere else until now in shanghai the food is awesome the drinks are amazing and the atmosphere is super the waiters the manager the chef are super funny and super nice with everyone and they talk to every client despite the fact that the place is always full their eggs are awesome they do in a lot of ways and the one cooked at 63 degrees is just awesome really worth try it not once but a lot of times i will try it soon for brunch because they told me the brunch dishes are as cool as the a la carte menu, this restaurant knows how to treat a good egg with each variation exquisitely executed by this very creative chef the simple egg becomes heaven on a plate  order any dish that you see with an egg on it and you wont be sorry

also notable are the dragon beans and the ceviche enjoy, already the entrance makes you wanna go inside the lights are dimmed to create a cozy atmosphere we got a place at the bar where you can watch the barkeeper live his passion you defenately have to try some of their cocktails

on the menu youll find different parts of the beef but also some great seafood and fish we started with a baby lettuce salad a little bit too much salt but amazing tomatoes and the beef tartar the tartar was served in a little box on ice cubes with fries they were nothing special the meat was super tender and well spiced

the main dish was argentinian picanha with baked potatoes tomato salad and grilled onion filled with minced waguy beef which was the highlight from the main course

the restaurant has charme and invites you to stay the whole night service is friendly and the food delicious def a must if youre in shanghai and craving some good meat, raw made my birthday dinner most tasteful one in years the food was fast super delicious yummy meat and other side dishes every dish was brought with special care and great performance the ambiance itself is quite and clean
thank you raw for amazing dining experience specially on my bday , i just stepped out of the place and have to say that we all loved the steak it was wood grilled to perfection as it has a certain rawness like it was a 5 star camping kitchen made service staff were pleasant and the place was pretty cosy with an industrial design to wrap the restaurant package up

whats good
 loved the ribeye steak you can order by the size of the cut or by telling them how many people should share you can order a smaller piece so you can share and try other variety of items
 beef tartar was also excellent i think they buy pretty good beef cuts here

definitely will return to check it out again, going into this place is like having a food orgasm really the meat is amazing and their dishes with eggs are just fantastic i love the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and also the 63 degrees eggs ive been here a lot of times and all my friends want to come back as much as possible price are ok for the high quality food you eat the meat come from chile and argentina and is perfectly cooked im in love with their burger and their tartare the only problem is that you need to book in advance because the place is not big and its always full and its open daytime just on the weekend for the brunch but not weekdays also the location is very convenient as its pretty close to my apartment","Jazz bar",0.351148507767318
94,"it is good yes it meets a niche vegetarian chinese modern cuisine in this order solid option if going with a vegetarian but overall not impressed
we were 3 people for dinner the beginning was not the best we decided to order 1 winter set menu + a la carte dishes for the 3 of us to share 5 minutes after the order is done and the little receipt placed on the table the waitress comes to tell us that the set menu has a minimum order for 2 guests well this was not written anywhere nor were we informed before kitchen could not do one menu only then we decided to order all the dishes a la carte we asked the waitress to choose the dishes for us in order to replace the notavailableforoneperson set menu she did very kindly however i had the impression that staff are not very knowledgeable of the dishes in the menu having such a niche concept i would expect more knowledge about it
on the food side highly recommend the steamed mountain yam with pistachios coixseed  lily bulb cream soup creamy and rich the crushed pistachios make the perfect contrast in the dish and musttry the lotus root our favorite
the place has a nice interior zen style it conveys the image of organic and care for the ingredients would come back in the case they have a special occasion seasonal set menus guest chefs or others, a creative vegetarian menu that will delight vegetarians and non vegetarian look forward to returning for the deserts, vegetarian restaurants are often more miss than hit for me but you can be confident going to wujie its a highend restaurant tucked away on the 4th floor of a building on the bund previous comments about needing detailed directions are accurate decor is sleekcleanrefurbished industrial red brick walls bare concrete floors wooden furniture our grup of seven lobbed in quite late 915pm on a friday night  it was quite empty by then we ordered a bunch of dishes to share i enjoyed all of them the mushrooms in chilli peanut sauce and the lotus were particularly good be aware that you need to book a private room if you want to bring any alcohol with you no corkage but 10 surcharge on bill, this is an upscale vegetarian restaurant and the prices reflect that with an average plate price of $70rmb needing about four plates for two people  the restaurant is beautiful although it is buried on the fourth floor of a large building with no external view  a shame given it is on the bund

if there was external signage i didnt see it but found it because of the english address on the outside of the building and asking the doorman who let us in the building it is in has soho written at the top in white  understanding of english is not great  service was good even when they messed up our order and ended up giving us two free dishes worth $160rmb $25us by accident  language was not a factor because we  ordered by selecting our choices via an ipad

i have been a vegetarian for ten plus years and would have given the place only four stars because the tastes were not highly differentiated  the extra fifth star was for how they handled the extra unexpected dishes with grace, fantastic selection of wonderfully prepared vegetarian food we ate at both the shanghai and hangzhou locations and enjoyed every single dish we ordered the restaurant is upscale with terrific service our group included both vegetarians and nonvegetarians and everyone left raving about the food and completely satisfied, this is a gem of a restaurant they do not serve alcohol but the food is divine get clear directions from your hotel it is on the 4th floor of what looks like an office building but once you arrive you are in a different world we had three dishes and probably paid about $40 total they refused a tip the atmosphere was restful and i have no reservations about recommending anyone to go it is vegetarian food on a completely different level than i have ever had fabulous experience, wujie on the bund offers some of the most novel and surprising dishes i have tasted exquisite flavors unusual and thoughtful compositions of ingredients spices and textures and creative and beautiful presentations i have eaten there five or six times and each experience has been excellent most plates are small which is good because you can order a wide variety of dishes i have taken a number of chinese friends and every person has left impressed and very satisfied

prices are not inexpensive given chinese standards but the food is well worth the cost with beautiful minimalist decor and overlooking an impressive atrium in 22 on the southern side of the bund the one disappointment at wujie is that they do not serve wine or other alcohol however their juices and teas are lovely wujie is not simply an excellent vegetarian restaurant but is an excellent restaurant period and serves among the best and most elegant meals in shanghai, would definitely recommend this restaurant to vegans and vegetarians who are feeling deprived of good vegetable based food not always easy to find in china the mushroom lasagna is amazing and the walk along the bund to the restaurant makes for a lovely evening, although the place is placed in the 4th floor of a building and may be not so easy to find when i arrived i was surprised the waiter spoke english the menu had a great variety of vegetarian milk and egg and vegan dishes all of them beautifully photographed in the menu

i ordered a tofu and a mushroom dishes both were excellent in presentation and taste the kiwi juice was freshly made 100 natural

and the last but not the least although it is a restaurant located in a very nice place almost all the dishes cost around 50100 yuan which is very reasonable for this sort of restaurants in china, there are no words to describe the passion the crew put into those dishes in europe this would have 5 michelin stars at least you get stuff you never saw before everything tastes great and is perfect until the smallest detail not going there is a crime, my daughter prefers vegetarian so when we asked our hotel concierge for recommendations for chinese cuisine he recommended wujie we loved the food im not vegetarian but left feeling i wanted nothing beware that aside from being vegetarian they dont serve alcohol either i wouldve liked some wine however i cannot say enough good things about the food so flavorful and fresh i wish id written down each of the items we ordered the first was a mushroom dish then also a noodle dish fried on one side and also a broad bean dish all delicious i also ordered a burdock dates wolfberry tea which was interesting too for drinks they had something listed as peach vinegar which i hoped would be wine but wasnt however it was tasty in any case the staff were very busy and a bit hard to flag down but other than that we thoroughly enjoyed the meal the place is pretty nice so i was also please our final bill came out to only 282 rmb great value, stumbled upon this restaurant at the world financial center had a mushroom dish that was excellent and also a raw beet with avocado plate both very good, most of our family is vegetarian and were quite experienced with various vegetarian cuisines but this restaurant gave us many happy surprises from the beverages to the main courses to the desserts the servers were wonderfully kind and helpful we did not find the restaurant easilyperhaps give yourself a little extra timebut we thought the setting lovely, my wife and i like a break from meat once and a while and wujie fit the bill located at the very south end of the bund it was an easy walk from the fairmont peace hotel they used an ipad for a menu that described the dishes well included important facts such as if milk is an ingredient the ipad took take care of the language barrier we had the pad thai which was not like pad thai at all more of a lightly curried rice noodle stirfry very delicious we had interesting little tidbits made from rolled lotus root with crunch veggies inside with a dipping sauce and a japanese like noodle soup i wish i took pictures of the dishes they were beautifully presented but i was enjoying the food too much to snap photos very original vegetarian restaurant, this is an amazing vegetarian outlet in the 4th floor the service is quite good and the quality and flavor is enhanced

will return many times more good find, this was probably the best vegetarian food i ever had we took a set menu menu was in mandarin and i had no idea what we ordered and every single dish was very tasty and a real positive surprise

the location is on the bund in a very nice old building service is good and efficient personally i prefer a menu card instead of an ipad to order the food but overall a very positive experience, love the vegetarian food served here although i would avoid the thai vegetatian curry as it is very heavy handed and not the light curry that the thais do so well
easy to order as pictures and descriptions are loaded about each dish on a ipad the staff do not have much english and if you are going here for a view of the bund you will be disappointed the average price of most dishes is the 4870 rmb, we have been at the location at the world financial center we loved the food it is an amazing variety of vegetarian food from different countries both my wife and i are vegetarian and we really enjoyed the food at this restaurant, my husband and i went to this restaurant on a date night i am vegetarian but he is not and we both had a great meal the food was delicious creative but not pretentious and the service was great the price considering the quality was very good value the only reason ive not given it 55 is that they dont serve alcohol but otherwise it was a great place and well definitely being going back, amazing vegetarian fare excellent presentation one of the best vegetarian restaurants that ive ever been to one problem that i had was to find the place since there was no signs english signs outside the majestic looking building a bit expensive but totally worth it, i am a carnivore through and through i thought i would leave the restaurant hungry i left full and happy feeling a lot healthier than if i ate a steak and potato meal the presentation is fantastic and all the veggies and mushrooms extremely flavorful i recommend the lotus root that was my absolute favorite i couldnt believe there wasnt meat in there

the food aside go to the bathroom ladiesim sure you have despaired about the restroom offerings throughout shanghai their bathrooms are golden with gold toilets and gold fixtures its all selfie worthy if youre that type also the interior of the building itself is gorgeous with gawk worthy bridal shops, unique menu pure vegetarian ample choice and well presented very good location no alcohol service in restaurant but good choice of bars in same building, brilliant selection and excellent presentation the variety was great and we had four main course dishes all of which were equally superb
the restaurant is in a great spot on the bund in shanghai city centre nice ambiance and very clean inside definitely one of the best restaurants ive been to in shanghai
if youre a vegetarian in shanghai you will love this place
its not too expensive either and the portions are a better size than they appear in the menu we paid 440rmb <u+00a3>45 for 4 mains and 2 desserts total which for food this good is excellent value, i visited here with indian he is vegan however he was very satisfied of course it is tasty for me there are some couples in this restaurant, travelling in shanghai with an indian vegetarian colleague who had never been to china i wanted to treat him wujie is really a treat it has no view but the building on the bund is really pretty and the restaurant itself is modern and chic but not formal
the service as pretty good and the english ipad menu made it easy to order apart form the thai curry which i didnt like as i found it too sweet but then i live in sea and love spicy curries so i am a bit picky the food was truly delightful the green salad already had a great dressing and i really enjoyed the stuffed lotus roots we also loved the choice of drinks and i really liked the bhutanese saffron tea something really different i would definitely return even with my carnivore husband, my niece and i went to wujie for lunch beautiful restaurant great presentation and best of all the food was delish the flavors were sumptuous the blended fruit juices were fresh and clean had no problem with the cost and bought a box of miss ma macarons for later we wanted to return for tea but ran out of days we will be back and for a real kickcheck out the bathrooms  even if you do not need to use them the womens room is all liberachithe mens room just over the top, overpriced menu for this kind of price i would expect a better presentation or taste you paid for the location only as it near the bund which is a common issue in shanghai, this restaurant lived up to its reviews we took the set piece for two great presentation wonderful taste and texture also surprisingly filling loved the beetroot and ginger also rose and dragon fruit juice recommended, excellent food and great service must do restaurant for vegetarians we will definitely visit here again, this restaurant is on the fourth floor of a building on the bund and was at the opposite end to our hotel hyatt on the bund we had a 9pm reservation on jan 1 and apart from the couple who left as we arrived we were the only two diners it has an ok decor nothing particularly special but it is pleasant some of the dishes we ordered were amazing flavorful and spicy ordering from the ipad which also has the menu in english meant we got a little carried away and ordered way too much food im really bad at not writing down the dishes to share on ta but we tended towards the spicy mushroom bamboo shoots type of dishes they were great we had 2 appetizers four dishes and rice way too much for just two people two dishes we werent so keen on a tofu curry and a tofu vegetables dish the pictures on the ipad give you a good idea and we managed to do well with 46 excellent choices drinks were rather pricey dont think they serve alcohol ordered a bottle of water for $3us and thought that would do both of us i didnt read the menu properly as it was tiny have to say on a 17 night trip the dishes we liked here were the best we had excluding a couple of indian restaurants my husband is a full fledged carnivore and even he admitted that it was delicious tough to find a place that is thoroughly enjoyed by veggies and meat eaters highly recommended service though is a bit tepid if you go make sure you do a trip to the ladies or gents toilets are in an adjoining circus themed nightclub and they are quite elaborate and funky, i was in shanghai and in search of a vegetarian restaurant wujie on the bund was just a few blocks from my hotel so i went to try it out

its on the 4th floor of a historic building there is no view from the restaurant in case that is your primary motivation for going

the decor was simple and peaceful and that added to the experience before i went i had found a menu online but cant seem to locate it to provide the link here the building website is httpwwwbund22comdinningphp there are a few photos on their website

i had gone on my own so that i could enjoy multiple items i ordered two small dishes i could see where going with two or more people would be beneficial as many of the items on the menu looked so good the food was presented very nicely and more importantly tasted great

as others have said you order on an ipad there are pictures of all the items with descriptions in english if needed if you have questions the waitstaff will be happy to answer them, a friday night i was told by one of the staff by the door that my reservation is not in their system this is hilarious i showed them my phone records evidently proved i contacted the restaurant twice confirming my reservation been made it is a very important dinner to be that is ruined without any sense of politeness and apologetic attitude she demanded us to sit by the chairs over there she was out of sight forever 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes past no one ever came over and talk to us about the solution we are kept there waiting certainly no one bother to apologize and they might assume we failed to make a reservation after 15 minutes of waiting i walked to the front desk and said we will be leaving now she was woken up by that sentence and decided to take us to a seat their service is horrible and unacceptable the service afterwards is under average clearly the staffs dont have any politeness

the food however is good even though the food shy portioned the taste is special i wish it could be less oily as most of the dishes are heavily oil

the service doesnt match the price bad value and i wont consider to go unless i really need to, being married to a vegetarian i get dragged to a lot of veg restaurants most of them are average some are boring and using mock meats and a few are good wujie is great better than great even dedicated meat lovers will enjoy this exquisite meal the food doesnt pretend to be something else its extremely well composed and executed and leaves you wanting to come back mushroom katsu and mountain yam is amazing but basically everything we ate and we had a lot was fantastic its not cheap by chinese standards but you can easily walk out after a full meal for two having spent around us$ 100 thats ok for such an amazing meal, we went her because of the fact that our business partners are vegetarian i prefer meat on my plate but to be honest what a pleasant surprise nice dishes well prepared spiced and good to eat and healthy i will not become vegetarian but will come back also keep in mind that this restaurant doesnt serve alcohol so healthy all the way, the peace and quiet of this elegant restaurant is to enjoy after the hustle and bustle of the bund the staff were very patient whilst our order took time to be created on tablet presentation was eyecatching and mouth watering this from a nonvegetarian i cannot speak too highly of the quality of the food and would certainly recommend a visit, i am a vegetarian so everything i ordered on this menu was divine not only was it good because the options were aplenty but every dish was tastefully put together and flavors were authentic with unique flair this was by far the best food i tasted in my travels through hong kong shanghai and beijing i absolutely loved everything about this restaurant it is classy with a nice ambiance and easy to order ipad system, quick visit to shanghai and my friends took me to this wonderful vegetarian restaurant the location is right across the road from the waterfront with all the stunning shanghai views the meals are all presented with as much attention to the presentation as the taste and every dish just blew me away
when i return this is the place i will be returning to, few friends selected this vegetarian restaurant as the solution for having me dine with them stepping into this very discreet place gave a good impression and the restaurant seemed very popular with many locals the menu and ordering on ipad is convenient and very helpful takes away the language barriers the dishes are all very elegantly presented very tasty to eat for me this is more of fusion cooking nice blends of styles in china

though the dishes were for single serving we went the chinese way and shared all of the dishes not one dish was to less interesting which kept the excitement of the evening the location is the best as one can walk on the bund before and after dinner which is before and after sunset walk each being a beautiful experience timed around an exquisite dining experience, we actually went to wujie xujiahui park branch of the same chain it is located on 392 tain ping road xuhui district shanghai china 200030 tel 4009201517 the food was exquisite in taste i cannot figure out the names of all the dishes including a fantastic tomato soup with some vegetables added
there were tofu dishes taro noodles `meatlike dishes lotus pickle a great mango sherbat for desert etc i think we hung around for 2 hours during lunch although the restaurant was full i was told that you need to book in advance particularly for dinner i have eaten in many veggie places in beijing nanjing xian and other cities but this was probably the best veggie food that i have eaten in china

subra a, wujie charms from the beginning with its delicate still life in the entryway once we figured out the ipad and how to order we were off to the races every single thing i ate was excellent especially the eggplant dishes and an interesting vegetarian take on a local delicacy made with lotus root the chef loved our enthusiasm so much that he sent out a special condiment for us to taste that he is working on launching in august it was dark jammy with the flavors of caramelized onions and mushrooms and one of the most delicious things i have eaten in a long time i look forward to returning time and time again, we used an ipad to order our food which helped with pictures and some introduction about the dishes
everything looked quite exquisite although the portion was shy
my personal favorites fried tofu thingy chiloe and bean noodles, we struggled to find this little gem as i went off the address on trip advisor once we found the building we were amazed at the beauty of it we had a pram and two young children the door man carried the pram all the way to the restaurants door
the restaurant had a relaxing feel no one spoke english but that didnt matter because we were handed ipads to order off
we had five dishes although small they were full of flavour and completely satisfying my husband and i believe this is one of the best meals we have ever had visiting china even the kids loved it definitely going back, the food was excellent all in the details especially like their tofu cut into tiny bits full points for the craftsmanship if not for its high prices i would give it a 5, the food was delectable we ordered a soup as well as a noodle dish just right for the two of us if you like spicy food simply ask and the chef will gladly oblige fortunately one is provided with an ipad which has pictures so for non chinese speakers ordering is seamless the food was well presented a nice alternative  innovative menu the mel was complimented by fresh juices will i go again  a big yes, if you think vegetarian food are boring then you have not eaten at wujie the food here are not just delicious but artfully presented too taste so good that youd forgotten that you are in a vegetarian restaurant

im most impressed with their creation of veggie based macarons which not just take up the natural coloring of the ingredients but tasted yummy the other deserts dishes are to die for too

i have to say this is my best gastronomic experience in shanghai this whole trip if you only have time for one proper sit down meal in shanghai forget the michelinstarred restaurant fancy steak houses or overpriced japanese omakase meal this is where you should eat, not only was the food amazing and the location really special but the staff were helpful and friendly the lady who spoke english attended upon us and was happy to give recommendations because she was so familiar with the extensive menu particularly recommend the lions mane mushrooms and whatever you do make sure you dont forget dessert, we had a nice dinner at this place  way beyond our expectations do not forget to try desserts
everything we ordered were very delicious and tasty, located in a 6 story commercial bldg across from the bund same bldg as napa wine kitchen on zhongshan rd im not vegetarian but i am inspired by incredibly prepared local ingredients wujie is such a refreshing alternative to the overpriced overhyped restaurant scene in this area i had 3 wonderful dishes for 200rmb that stack up with the finest nonvegetarian food i have eaten there is no beer or wine served here which is less than ideal but i would make that tradeoff every time for this wonderful dining experience, in our trip to china i decided to avoid eating meat among the reasons one is that they seem to eat many things that id prefer not to eat so we went for vegetarian restaurants
this restaurant is located in a beautiful building in an impressive place the bund the architecture is part of the experience the restaurant decoration is rather modern and minimalist
the aesthetics of the food is remarkable the taste of the food we chose was in agreement with the aesthetics of the restaurant remarkable, located at 22 the bund level 4 in a gracious old red brick but totally refurbished building overlooking pudong across the river  wujie the bund is a fabulous restaurant preparing vegetarian dishes as good as you will find anywhere on the planet with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients and inspired presentation  and impeccable service delivered with utmost professionalism by the attentive restaurant staff  wujie will impress the most discerning gastronomes i have attached images of just three dishes  each one unique and delicately and perfectly spiced two of the very pleasant and helpful staff  jessie and sheryl  took pains to explain the ingredients and how they were prepared the aesthetics in the restaurant are a mix of serene tradition and clean lines  an atmosphere of refined sophistication  making dining a relaxed and enjoyable experience the combination of firstclass food beautiful surroundings and attentive and friendly staff  wujie will make your visit to shanghai memorable","Healthy",0.840490819370382
96,"the church i was attending in singapore their missionary team was in shanghai recently in the 2nd weekend of march they treated us to this restaurant for dinner

the decor is very classy and comfortable one of their specialty they recommended which is very famous in shanghai was their cold leng in mandarin cai and it did have an exquisite taste

their xiao long bao was very tasty and soupy

their san pin in mandarin was just nice and suit the tastes of all the guests

their chicken feet was well done

i particularly liked their winter bamboo shoot which could not be found in singapore

their fried prawns rolls were really delicious too

their dessert the almond dessert with egg whites was luckily not too sweet

no doubt this restaurant also lives up to its reputation same as the one in singapore, the food is is the best cantonese in the city the only restaurant i view as up to hong kongs high standard of cooking the decor is very classy but comfortable the management team and waitstaff excellent they all do a very good job of taking care of their guests
the weekend dimsum lunch menu is fantastic but the waits are crazy make sure you book far in advance dinner is not as crazy but is more expensive still reasonable price and for the quality well worth it, great chinese dim sum in a nice restaurant we loved the interior design we hav<u+00b4>d several specialties and all were very tasty, wonderful restaurant with incredible food great lunch and great dinner the goose and the custard buns were just incredibleas well as the shrimpsand many other very good dishesthere are many fancy very expensive places in shanghai but this one just looks good and the food is great for a price that is very very reasonable i miss the posibility to order wine by the glassa pity since they have nice ones too but that is a problem in almost any restaurant in china have no doubt and just enjoy ths great kitchen, service is really good and welcoming is great dim sum and chicken sticky rice really tasty got also some pork dish with crispy skin with mustard and it was also a good dish but im over surprised that this place has been awarded with 2 michelin stars, i had the pleasure to enjoy this restaurant repeatedly and every time it is a triumph if you are looking for a good advisor ask for lester who is the manager very polite and professional great job keep it up thank you, on new years eve we wanted to treat ourselves with michelin star chinese food but were utterly disappointed the food completely lacked taste and presented itself as ordinary plain everyday dishes but at very high prices which had no connection whatsoever to the quality you can buy the same dishes allover shanghai at less than a fifth of the price service was nonexistent and dishes very cleaned by the staff in the middle of the restaurant the room had no magic if you do not want to be fooled for your own money then do not go and michelin should remove the star immediately, not sure what michelins criteria or how much they were paid to grant the two star rating but i had much better food in my home town congee queen restaurants

maybe i ordered the wrong dishes but out of the 7 plates i would think at least one would knock it out of the park instead all were mediocre at best so paying outrageous prices for a mediocre meal did not sit well

decor was nice but service was spotty our tea was cold and not replenished

will be leery of michelin rated restaurants in the future

as for the imperial save your money and eat at the many other quality restaurants, amazing tibetan tea started us off and our colleague ordered an assortment of items including three types of dumplings soup steamed with shrimp and a fried pork  delicious the rice noodles were one my favorites  light and so flavorful with some bean sprouts and a big beautiful shrimp yum, upscale chinese at its best the dumplings were done to perfection  they had a little liquid and expertly prepared meat the sweet and sour was harmonious rather than being flavors that ineffectively compete everything we ate showed great balance try the mango pudding for desert, was in shanghai recently and some chinese foodie friends took me to this place we arrived at 200pm after making a reservation and had trouble getting a table to say this place is popular and busy in an understatement no idea how to reserve as my friend took care of it but you will need to

decor is nice with both private rooms and large dining rooms we were in the dining room and it had that nice hustle and bustle of a good chinese restaurant it was not so loud though that a comfortable conversation was not possible

the food is what you come here for and it is amazingly good with subtle clean flavors that are perfectly on point for the dishes this place serves small plates with a shanghai touch that is not to say typically shanghainese in flavor but a definite touch in a very good way that differentiates it from traditional cantonese styles i am not going to remember all the dishes we had but here is a close list salted duck egg buns watch for the filling squishing out dried fish pork and apple soup amazing flavors to it looed pork hock skin chewy and tender at the same time with a ginger flavor tripe pork ribs shu mai rice pancakes with shrimp they add sliced you tiao for a subtle and delicious crunch pork liver zhou the zhou was creamy smooth and the liver has a nice flavor that was not strong or overpowering and tofu soup yummy with a subtle herb broth all the food was good some of it was amazing service was okay but nothing special as we arrived late they were out of a lot of their popular dishes we were also shooed out a bit as they were cleaning for dinner and the guy with the vacuum was not interested in waiting for us to leave

go for the food because it is amazing, we went to a few places that were all booked on a friday night as we had just arrived into the city 10 people total the reception staff was standard but when we met alan he was simply the best he spoke good english and was funny he told us no table for 10 was immediately available but he let us place our order while waiting so when we were sat which was pretty quickly we had our food within 10 minutes the food was great we have some food preferences in our group and he allowed us to ask for a dish but without pork the food was delicious we had the chicken with cashew and chili and the chicken claypot with out pork liver the others in our group had crispy taro duck which was great alan was most accommodating to our group and we absolutely enjoyed our time the restaurant is on the 4th floor and the only tenant on that floor the decor is beautiful upscale and high class with affordable options we had a great time

thank you alan, this is my first visit to this restaurant we went there for a family dinner the main seating area is spacious and looked kitch with long lightbulb ornaments hanging from the ceiling as you can see in some photos
all dishes were superb but the peking duck was our favorite they first gave us some tiny pieces of skin which are supposed to be the best part of the skin the think crispy wafer pieces felt so light in your mouth and tasted really great
the sharks fin with the thick chicken broth was also very good very creamy
this is not a cheap restaurant a bit pricey side but its really worth it, being a fan of this chain having it in singapore the quality here is just as good but service here not as impressive actually the captain was nice singaporean i assume but the local waitress was rude to start with and staff not as attentive even at 8plus almost 9 where the restaurant wasnt crowded
i love the daily soup and always have it but today as the waitress exclaimed was already finished by lunch that was disappointing but was gladly surprised by the watercress soup and my guest was also impressed by how good simple dish like kailan was so nice and crunchy

it was overall expected of this chain to provide good food and why i will always return service could be better like in singapore, i went to lunch at imperial treasure which was just across the street from the peninsula hotel i went with three chinese teenage students whom i had become friends with in the us during their studies at a boarding school they did the ordering since i knew them well enough to know that they are very good sophisticated eaters the assortment of dishes that they ordered were outstanding fish chicken squab dumplings vegetables and on and on everything was perfect the restaurant is modern in style and has great service a reservation is a must, a dozen of us  work colleagues  came here for dinner on a monday night we enjoyed a wide variety of dishes community style that is so popular for chinese meals very classy place within walking distance of the bund there were so many excellent dishes  one after another  it is difficult to recall each one i really enjoy this style of eating  almost like sampling so much different nicely prepared dishes great place for large groups  very good food service classy atmosphere  that can be followed with a nice stroll on the bund, this restaurant  and the whole group weve eaten at their branch in singapore  is one of the top dining establishments in the world the ambiance is refined the service is impeccable and the dim sum is of extremely high quality we had traditional items and some unusual innovative dishes and all were skilfully prepared and very tasty one dish was called a baked char sieu bun it was a fluffy bun on the bottom with a sweet crust crown on top the filling was extremely moist and a perfect balance of sweet and savoury

anyone who is critical of this restaurant cannot be pleased by anything, the dim sum was fantastic and very good most of the dim sum is made to order as it is only cooked after an order is made the decor is fantastic and service is excellent great for family outing or business, the surroundings are spectacular in a luxury shopping mall full of super brands you walk out of the lift into a long corridor with wine chillers either side of what i suspect to be fine wines the decor is classy and modern warmer than nyc chic but certainly far from traditional dim sum restaurant

the dumplings were moist juicy and delicate har gau my barometer with dumplings were fresh sweet and with a thin pastry that was the perfect delivery mechanism for the prawn filling chung fun like wise had the delicate rice pastry with a delicious fried prawn and bamboo filling a roast duck and noodle soup duck yolk sweet bao steamed glutinous rice chicken feet were all excellent a special mention goes to xo sauce turnip cake and the taro croquette they were the best ive ever had

cost for 3 ppl 70usd now i know this is far from cheap for local standards but amongst the other places i went to in shanghai this was good value to me ive since found out imperial treasure is a singaporean chain ill certainly look forward to trying another one if i see one on my travels, my review now is probably tinged by the fact that this was the last restaurant visited on my stay and so unless you are blown out of your socks a certain weariness has set in the dining room is spectacular an the atmosphere is elegant refined and feels very luxurious the food was certainly up to scratch but in a city which offer so much variety and so much exquisite food this just fell slightly short on wow factor dont get me wrong a an enormously varied menu well present and with many highlights best enjoyed with chinese hosts to guide you through the standard is high and the service is attentive but i would keep searching in a city so well endowed with fabulous eateries, i have been to this restaurant twice the first visit was back in october 2014 for dinner and the second visit was in september 2015 for lunch i personally prefer the food served at dinner time however if you are after the dim sum then you must go during lunch the last time we were seated at the common area which had amazing views of the lighted buildings of shanghai at night this time we were in a private room the restaurant overall is beautifully decorated and has this sophisticated feeling to it the food in general is average to above average standards with the exception of the peking duck which i did find it to be one of the best i have eaten so far the servers were attentive to our needs which i think could be due to the fact that were in a private room on the contrary we did find the manager to be a bit arrogant overall i would be recommending this restaurant anyone who wants to have great chinese food does not have a tight budget and is around the bund area, been here previously in the summer for dim sum and it was for the most part dim sum with the usual offerings but there are some dishes that shows innovation and flare such as their ha cheung fun that was wrapped with deep fried cruller other dim sum items are perfectly good returned in feb for dinner wn one of the private rooms with our family with lots of kids the private room is huge with tv for the kids and a private bathroom nearby the wine list is pretty decent with some good offerings

the manager came by and recommended some dishes to try and they were all excellent since we had a private room for the most part we were served by one wait staff that was fairly attentive during the meal

the nonprivate room portion of the restaurant is pretty fancy and cater to providing very good cantonese food to probably a host of expats from hk singapore the dishes i have tried are all consistently good, dishes were served in strange order as if we are here just to fill our stomach fried rice comes before the entree and soup came when we were half way through the meal ordered a vegetable dish and had to changed it 3 times as the waiters keep on suggesting dishes on the menu that they ran out of ingredients staff doesnt seem to care if they interrupt conversations at the table the food was average and do not order the lemon chicken in which the sauce was thick like glue the overpriced cod which comes at rmb95 per person is just a rip off it is not worth the price tag, beautiful decor attentive service gorgeous plating sumptuous food

our dinner in a private room was such a respite from the usual noisy and smoky dining in shanghai the private powder room added a nice touch to the whole private dining experience

every dish was served course by course to each diner and paired with excellent champagne and wine plonking all dishes and drinks on the lazy suzy just wont do here

lester the restaurant manager who speaks english mandarin cantonese and malay in his affable and discreet manner made sure no detail was overlooked loud talking and gesticulations by service staff are simply unacceptable

imperial treasure hailing from singapore certainly did not disappoint in terms of unsurpassed service and assurance of quality food sourcing only the best that singapore has to offer

we bade farewell to the shanghai skyline wellfed and happy , overall a good experience the dishes we tried included shrimp dim sum vegetable dumplings and xiao long bao  all excellent mala tofu dan dan mian and the soup of diced seafood were outstanding fried rice with pork  shrimp were standard filet turbot fish was good but not great wines were quite expensive at this price level however you expect more attention to details  the restrooms toilets sorely needed cleaning though ayi was present the dining room allowed noisy children to disturb other guests never urging parents to restrain them also theres no special views of the city or bund from this 4f setting the sting came with the bill  an unexpected 10 service fee i would recommend a onetime visit but there are other cantonese and all types of chinese restaurants with better food for this price, i went to this restaurant on a friends recommendation it was on a weekend over lunch culturally cantonese lunch is about dimsum and it is exactly what we had

reservation i called at 11 oclock in the morning to reserve a table at 1130 on the same day to my surprise the receptionist said it was overbooked and the restaurant is full bear in mind that i found out that the restaurant is supposed to be open from 11 onwards nevertheless i walked into the restaurant 15 minutes later and found out that there is a long waiting line the receptionist asked us to wait while taking our details after waiting for about 10minutes we were shown to a table for 4 the morale is do not call to book walk in early to get your table

car park there is a car park at the basement of the building no free parking available

food simply great very authentic hong kong taste dimsum is very awesome reminds me of how it is like in hong kong

service very attentive waiterswaitresses managers around are very helpful quite a bit of cantonese speaking managers around if your putonghua is not great speak in cantonese

recommended for those who desire a hk dimsum experience in shanghai, i think this is the best chinese food i ever had the beef the prawns the fish and the veggies were fabulous and what to say about the dimsum ill certainly go back there
the restaurant is quite beautiful as well, the best thing about this place is the interior decoration and service feels upclass even as soon as you enter the foyer of the building wait staff are attentive and operate on a unique 2 step service system 1 person brings the food in another person puts it on your table

we ordered a few dishes veg plates were nice but nothing exciting the main issue i had was with the meat dish 3 meat grill plate which came with a scarce amount of pork chicken and duck the poultry was extremely bony and lacked meat the price you pay for it can elsewhere get you a whole roast duck or a round of peking duck for two

theres better upclass chinese elsewhere definitely but perhaps come here to say you tried, arrived earlier in the day and luckily dinner was already planned for yu bao from start to finish the meal was fabulous as was the service if you are looking for classic chinese cuisine then make sure yu bao is on your short list while in shanghai, been to imperial treasure from the early days when they opened till now where you absolutely have to make a reservation especially during weekends for lunch
its a great restaurant as they serve great dim sum as well as dishes to share
for dim sum the usual fare are great but you must try the wonton noodle soup as its so flavorful yum roast duck and pork carrot cake with xo sauce are very good too
for dishes the crispy chicken frogs leg with crispy ginger slices stewed abaloneomg its so good stewed fish head from  lakes with a thousand island and even their version of the famous chili crab from singaporewhere this restaurant originates from are must try
a highlight of the restaurant is their manager lester great personality and a great host he can more suggest and recommend to your liking and ensures a great dining experience, very good location and food beautifully appointed room and attentive staff not too many westerners make it to this restaurant even though its so highly rated and the menu is translated into english  we were the only westerners there when we visited and were warmly welcomed

the menu is extensive and it was a tough decision to chose just a few dishes the bbq combo duck and pork in our case and the prawns in singaporestyle spicy sauce were the two highlights for us yes i know the last dish isnt really chinese but all the food we ordered from dim sum to mains were very good

be aware they dont serve wine by the glass this is understandable as all the locals are drinking tea and westerners are rare wasnt a problem for us but just so you know

id definitely return, we went to this restaurant in august 2014 and i would definitely return this place while upscale appears to be geared mostly toward locals we were the only westerners in the restaurant this is confirmed by reviewing the menu which includes many traditional chinese dishes that most westerners disfavor which is exactly what we were looking for for example the menu which is huge by the way includes things like birds nest soup pigeon and pig ear

our meal included birds nest soup xiao long bao dumplings chinese vegetables and peking duck everything was excellent ive had better peking duck in beijing but this was very good nonetheless

the service was also very good they were very attentive and helpful and spoke english very well, this was an important business lunch and the location is good in an excellent high end shopping mall the quality of everything is really very good and exclusive the quality of the private rooms ideal the decoration is sophisticated modernfood is excellent and of a high quality we had a wide selection and i am sure that all of the food here is excellent
this is one of the best that i have been to in the last couple of years in shanghai and beijing, we came for here for dinner on the last day of our trip this was highly recommended by a friend of mine we came for here for a great experience and there was nothing more we could have asked forlocated at the bund you should be able to find yifeng galleria on google maps the setting and ambiance is what you would expect from a fine dining establishment good decor and furnishing service was good as well

pricing wise the restaurant offers certain flexibility if money is not a constraint by all means go all out otherwise be prepared to spend above rmb200pax we had the sichuan style spicysour soup claypot seafood beancurd soy sauce chicken and prawns we were impressed overall by the flavours texture and balance of the dishes certainly the best meal we had in shanghai it was a really good dining experience

definitely a place to visit again do make a reservation in advance

note the location as per the map is slightly off, we were invited here by family friends who live in shanghai and truly appreciate chinese food i can say without qualification that this is the best dim sum i have had anywhere including 30 trips to hong kong vancouver new york guangzhou toronto it makes sense though there is the demand and purchasing power in shanghai for excellent food and this food is excellent the peking duck was succulent and crispy they had you youtiao and shrimp wrapped in rice flour rolls  this was spectacular excellent turnip cakes and ha gao and extraordinary variety made to order all in really comfortable civilized setting good luck getting a reservation on the weekends this place is booked by regulars, when it comes to chinese cuisine in shanghai you can never find one that consistently provides top quality variety of chinese cuisine be it a sumptious meal or just for dim sum

i have lost count on the number of visits to this restaurant whenever i do get to shanghai every alternate month the restaurant features modern decor and you have a choice of a private room with intimate settings be it for personal or business functions the outlet is really crowded especially during the lunch or dinner period it is advisable to place a prebooking to avoid any disappointment

there is an increasingly wide selection of chinese cuisine to opt for my favorites which you may try it includes

1 roasted beijing duck
2 deep fried crab claw stuffed with minced shrimp
3 pan fried tofu pork meat in chicken soup
4 deep fried live prawns with pepper  salt or soy sauce
5 steamed or deep fried soon hock fish with superior sauce
6 pan fried egg with shrimp
7 steamed minced pork with chenpi
8 deep fried frog with sliced ginger
9 stewed fine noodle with ginger  onion

my compliments to mr stephen chung and mr lester fong both executive mgr of the outlet who has done an excellent job in maintaining the food served are consistently at a high standard you may also get to enjoy the excellent vocal cord of mr lester fong to sing you a romantic song while you dine

try it and am sure you will not regret visiting the outlet for all you know you will keep visiting it again and again like me who loves chinese food, one of my best dinners ever in china all dishes served were from an outstanding quality even if some were rather challenging tastewise for europeantop wine card with some exclusive and expensive french wines but also good choices at a more reasonable price level, what an amazing meal the peking duck was sensational the chef sliced it in front of our table the staff were wonderfully friendly and were extremely attentive word of warning it does not show on the correct place on the shanghai map we will be going again 5 stars, ive had many decent yum cha in many countries and this restaurant has a beautiful combination of excellent surrounds great service and quality food the dim sum is a la carte which is nice so there isnt the usual shouting mess of a busy yum cha restaurants they also have excellent bbq products and the usual selection of cantonese dishes the restaurant is not the cheapest but for shanghai its good value for excellent food id happily come back again, this is one of my favor chinese restaurants in shanghai it offers authentic cantonese dishes which is the most popular one in addition they also offer wellknown for roasting the beijing duck all of them are amazing  all dishes were well presented the prices are on the high side the service is acceptable but slow because this place is always full, if you are fussy about food quality etc in china the quality of food at imperial treasure will put you at ease service is also top notch however the food is also catered a little more to the chinese palate so it can be a tad salty so it you prefer a lighter taste inform the captain to make it less salty and less oily you will then most probably have a delightful meal there, the dishes look clean and tasty i am not a fan of shark fin rather despite the dishes however everything else was good this is a place for fancy southern chinese cuisine slightly pricy but affordable for oversea tourists","Chinese cuisine",0.999827345465153
97,"good pizza with a fun atmosphere tried a pizza a bruschetta and a lasagna very good wine recommended by the waiter great location in the french concession close to a lot of other restaurants, have just moved to shanghai and this has become a local favourite the food is fantastic try the lasagna or the lamb skewer  the service is very efficient and the atmosphere buzzing but equally relaxed have sat at the bar a few times just enjoying a hearty meal and glass of red keep up the great work, this place is nice overall atmosphere and food is quality and pleasant on the pricey side for what it is

recently while there we experience some unfortunate service when our change of 50 yuan was not returned after a discussion we discovered one of the waiters apparently thought it was a tip and had pocketed it causing a rather awl award situation for everyone instead of apologizing as they should have the staff seemed annoyed that we had asked for our change it left a bad impression after what had thus far been a pleasant meal, cosy atmosphere cool interiors tasty italian food especially the pizzas good wines in magnum size bottles young modern and friendly chinese staff recommend to take a stroll in the french concession area before heading here for dinner, i been there a few times always promising and consistent however this time the service was way below standard very disappointing due to cny they offered a limited selection but food was good as always staff was not motivated though, we had the chicken insalata in saltimbocca form and the pizza incazzata from now on the best pizza i had in my life we wanted to try the arancini balls but they were sold out unfortunately both plates were extremely good the chicken was moist with a subtle yoghurty flavour the pizza was an amazing mix of flavours that worked very well the mozzarella they used was top level as well the plates were quite big the two plates filled us quite well we were two persons a little expensive but well worth it and better value than some other restaurants in the area would be a nice place for a coffeewine and cake as well though we did not have room to sample the dessert menu, a very good italian the atmosphere is really good we like the food basically all choices are good, visited during a business trip  had been a favorite place of a colleague when living in sh wide selection of quite varied italian foods  should suit all tastes the food we had was generally well presented and tasty some of it fit into the comfort food category with bulk favored over quality there was a decent selection of wines as well and not surprisingly they were overpriced service was friendly and generally good though our table of 4 was quite cramped when the accoutrements of a proper meal all arrived dinner for 4 with wine was close to 100 usd per person
requested that the restaurant call a taxi or give us a reliable number  staff would not and suggested we go out and flag one down
we met the only sketchy individuals of our whole visit to shanghai outside on leaving the restaurant but luckily flagged a good taxi relatively quickly, positive surprise in shanghai excellent food friendly service nice and relaxed atmosphere and on top of all this comprehensive wine list and reasonable prices easy to recommend when you are fancy some italian food while in shanghai, make sure you reserve a table once you tired of chinese food and want some great western food i definitely can recommend doc gastronomia a great italian restaurant that serves familystyle great pizzas salads and meats so far nothing has been to my dissatisfaction even though i find the wine list a bit limited

enjoy white pizza salads served in a pizza shell wagyu steaketc

venue is nice and cozy, great neighborhood italian restaurant not just by china standards i live down the street and this is one of our usual goto spots i have never had a bad thing on the menu pizzas pastas arancini best experienced family style tends to be pretty busy on the weekends so if you are more than 2 people definitely call ahead, first thing to say nice venue even though it pretends a little bit too hard to look typical italian second from an italian point of view food is ok considering it is in china but nothing more than that good wine selection though definitely overpriced not crazily but nonetheless overpriced 6 out of 10, nice cozy placeduring weekends busywine chianti very nicede pizza margarita i took was delicious ingredients topthe spaghetti was al dente coockedthe sauce however could be more tasty and was missing the ingredients to make it greathowever we are in chinaall togather i recommend the place for food and environmentprices are moderately priced, excellent fresh well made and tasty great beer wine and cocktails too one of my standards when i come to shanghai salads are delicious too, delicious pizza from wood fire brick oven we ordered the angus beef minute steak with arugula both dishes were really delicious, we had a nice meal at doc and i enjoyed the casual and inviting atmosphere of the place the dishes were all good and the service polite and helpful, excellent quality with good wines and beers
went with 2 colleagues and we all enjoyed it however i would note that we ordered way too much and probably each of left half a pizza
meats and cheeses to start was superb and i guess imported
a nice taste of european food in the french quarter
we will return however it should also be noted that there seems to be a big choice of restaurants in the area, within the french concession on a street filled with restaurant i really entered hesitating was surprised by the warmth inside stony and woody as most med restaurants good food well presented great pizza and service to find english fluent waiters and waitresses in china is not easy good wine list with bigger emphasis on italian wines italian restaurant right reasonably priced good experience will probably repeat although i tend to eat chinese only when in china, the perfect restaurant to have a proper italian dinner the place is nice the staff is very helpful and the food is great and there are a wide selection of beers and wines they pay attention to details i recommend for everybody who love italian cuisine, very nice place with good italian food
ingredients are surprisingly very fresh and of good quality
the concept is good and the atmosphere too
waiters are very professional compared to other places in shanghai and they speak english
so for the food restaurant and service you are on the good way

the only complain is the sparkling water price that doesnt reflect the restaurant standard or service we took a san pellegrino 750ml imported italian water that is usually considered as a standard water in italy for 70rmb 10�  an appetizer is around 65rmbso ill let you think about it before ordering water and maybe change for some wine or cocktail instead
on a total of 350rmb the water price was almost 15 of our lunchthis is crazy if you know that on the bund you maybe find less of this price at gg or mercato, this area is worth a wander with lots of interesting places on offer doc was where i was meeting my shanghai friends and it was a perfect foil to a week of business lunches at chinese restaurants italian  aperol spritzes pizza pasta really good and some very delicious salads really enjoyed this place service was great and while we were put on the second floor out of the way it was all about what was on the table and the company which was exceptional, great food nice environment good service and never had a bad experience all ingredients imported from italy so very authentic entire menu recommended but if the chocolate souffle is on dig in, having made a 12 days trip in inland china this restaurant brought a european touch to the whole stay exquisite lunch topped with probably the best tiramisu i ever ate this in an atmosphere of good taste a very hospitable owner lovely interior a willgoback, the wood stove pizza here is splendid very tasty and worth the expensive price there are much cheaper pizza joints in shanghai but you are genuinely getting what you pay for here

my only significant complaint about this place is that they really pack it in with the tables your very close to each other and the environment is very loud expat talk heavy if you are thinking of a nice quiet romantic italian dinner this perhaps isnt your place there are other venues in the city for that

i did not try anything else other than the pizza but all the dishes on the other tables looked delicious this will be my goto joint if i want a highquality pizza place walks all over pizza express, we arrived at 1900 at this restaurant in the french concession the restaurant is on dongpin road which is a nice street with shops bars and restaurants we were here in march and the restaurant being almost empty at that time we found it very cold we were actually eating with our jackets on which is actually not strange in shanghai in winter being the 5 of us we ordered 4 pizzas to share and had a bottle of wine the pizzas are good but a bit overloaded with good toppings we could not finish all the pizzas the 4 pizzas a bottle of wine and some drinks for the children we ended up paying more than rmb1000 which is very expensive, ended up here by default a nearby restaurant was closed for chinese new year and this was close by sat at the bar and ordered ribeye steak which was very good and one of the best i`ve had in shanghai returned a week or so later and enjoyed bresoala and pizza, the best italian restaurant in shanghai  best pizza cooked in a wood oven the staff is very very professional  the chef make me feel really like at my home , pizza go between 130 to 190 and there is absolutely nothing special about them
bruschetta is 65 to 90 yep thats a toast of bread with some tomato and other simple food

and service is just  terrible
 sat down waited 10 min still to waiter when there are only 3 tables occupied had to get up to pick the menus myself
 waiter comes for order i say hello my partner says hello he replies with a grunt  which he continue to do through the meal

great balcony, we go there quite frequently it is best pizza in shanghai salads and extremely good deserts nice wines we were not impressed by their olives and focaccia with pork bread is always excellent and you can buy it for take away
not cheap, overall we felt that the food quality has gone down quiet a bit while the prices have been increased service and food delivery was slow anyway the key point was that the waitress knocked down the whole glass of red wine over my wifes cashmere scarf blouse and trouser a hasty sorry was offered but no other action extra service or offer was extended except if needed to send my wifes expensive clothes to a local laundry which hardly anyone is willing to risk to send designer clothes to anyway accidents can happen but proper and sincere service recovery should be expected from this sort of restaurant what a nice valentines experience indeed thank you very much we paid the bill and left to never come back again for sure, we went there for lunch we had a good time but i feel that this place a little overpriced for me i would have expect at least a little more quantity, we have been here twice and it is a nice place with great food i always order pizza at an italian i do not know very well as they usually mess up other stuff but next time i will dare take something else or maybe not as the pizza is great good ingredients, tucked away in a suburb of shanghai that somehow escaped the china chaos syndrome this italian restaurant is another place thats worth the taxi fare from your hotel authentic pizza cooked in a wood fired oven an outstanding collection of international beers and friendly staff its also very popular with a good mix of international clients booking in advance is recommended and probably essential, went for christmas lunch with a group of friends really enjoyed the food great salad seafood pasta and steak good selection of wine unfortunately the service still needs to catch up better to go with a bigger group as youll have more attention and service, excellent real taste italian restaurant close by shanghai downtown

especially good pizzas and pastas with great selection of dishes and wines and beer

very cozy environment

pricy but worth it if you want to stay away from the thousands of fake italian eatery around, a lively joint with a great menu we had a party of 10 and they accommodated us easily and were very attentive the wine was flowing heard nothing but praise about every single dish ordered i enjoyed the casual atmosphere and would go back anytime, this is my 2nd visit to doc and our first visit started off been a big rough although ended up been a wonderful evening with family and friends

this time around i arrived with a colleague without a booking and after a quick drink at the bar we were ushered over to a table

theres the standard menu and a lengthy specials menu and i have to say it all looks good

we started off with what i thought was going to be a standard looking pizza although with quite an unusual mix of topping sorry cant remember them all although what turned up is best explained as an open top calzone  it was chewy rich with cheese and loaded with flavour what a hit we then both headed for pasta dishes one speacial ragu with ox tail and i had spaghetti with a beautiful tomota base and pork cheek both dishes were hit

we washed all of this down with a great bottle of italian red

not only is the food great the venue in relaxing that great wood pizza oven cured meats hanging in the background locker and rings of fresh crunchy bread in full view give the place this very italian rustic feel in the middle of the french qtr of shanghai

the service is efficient without been intrusive so keeps you relaxed while food turns up without any intrusion have to give a shout out to sam who kept us well looked after

as they say do yourself a favour and head over to doc when in shanghai, even my italian colleges in china say this is the best in shanghai
try the meat and cheese plates as a starter they are very good and the warm rosemary bread is excellent the main courses are not too big because there is a wide variety i would recommend to just order a few dishes and share them, very trendy italian restaurant modern great food choices loved the italian music and ambiance ordered the arugula salad and principe pizza  solid options we went on a tuesday night and it was always packed each night i passed it during the week, i had an amazing meal at the doc in the french concession the food was great the wine was authentic and the tiramisu is selfproclaimed to be the best in the world you will have an amazing experience with the professional staff and great food at the doc, typical italian food extremely generous portions need to be hungry especially good pizza with mushrooms and the desserts good not the best wines by the glass nice location too, group of four and all were extremely satisfied with our meals 2 pizzas huge and 2 pastas were all amazing started with a cheese and olive board that were very nice and served with great bread

come for the atmosphere stay for the food

would be 5 stars but the service isnt the best dont go if youre in a big hurry, in the heart of the french concession this is one of the best kept secret for tourists not so much for locals pizzas are excellent the pasta options is good wine list very interesting
if you book a table +86 21 6473 9394 make sure you ask for a table by the window, sometimes curiosity gets you to just check for consistency second time around doc delivered on better seasoning last time too salty in everything and freshness with its shrimp and frisee salad pizza pappardelle bolognese was quite flavorful and home made pasta well received

compared to its competitors quality is right there devote fantastic price still premium, pizza lover fully satisfied with very good replication of authentic italian wood fired pizzas

menu stated that their tiramisu was very very best having lived in italy and become somewhat of a tiramisu bore i was highly sceptical my bad this was an amazing tiramisu theres this place in milano though

very well done doc great restaurant

one complaint the food was brought to us too quickly is this a complaint we felt slightly rushed and this made us a little uncomfortable, popped in here with friends fantastic food always they told us well i have to say id go again and envy them living so close
lively atmosphere beautifull fresh fruit and seasonal options
i was hard pressed to choose my food really delicious, first i have some doubt about the italian originality of this restaurant  the service very bad  italian restaurant with chinese restaurant style weathers   bad quality of raw material used for my pizza  i tested separately the italian salsiccia and mozzarella over  absolutely not good   frittelle di baccala almost whit out baccala  stock fish   the test of the wine nero davola look like fake and 075 l of san pellegrino water 70rmb  in italy it cost less than one euro  , this italian restaurant has excellent food and wine choices its also welldesigned with rustic charm i loved the open floor windows on the 1st floor the patio on the 2nd floor and the floor tiles if you call to make reservation and nobody picks up the phone youll greetings in english on the answering machine and feel free to leave a message in english or chinese theyll call you back fast i found this efficiency to be very western and i liked it, i liked to come to doc at the very beginning it had been a long time since our lars visit and decided to have a pizza over there

good was good it has always been without being exceptional service was on the other hand not at the level you would expect and finally it was very expensive

prices were never cheap but they increased a lot from the beginning 190 cny 25 eur the san danielle pizza was simply outrageous

shanghai offers several other more reasonable options look for mercato for higher end pizzas prices are very close but the quality is much better or not to far mamma mia which is an excellent option, the lady matred here is terrible and dense came here for early dinner at 515pm when the restaurant was at most 15 occupied and totally empty she wanted to sit is next to the cash register and when we requested for another table a little further inside since there was no one she said it was all reserved we went across the road for dinner and after dinner we came by doc at 630pm it was at most 40 occupied so dissapointed with this place","Italian cuisine",0.567305765765148
98,"ok first off i admit we probably ordered the wrong thing the idea of a picture menu is fine but you still dont know what you are ordering
had heard this place talked up quite a bit from another tour we were on so decided to try it out yes grannies mashed potatoes were ok but nothing special the crispy beef and nut dish we got was disappointing the beef chucks were tiny little pieces like mom left in the skillet back when you fried hamburgers
again im sure we just ordered the wrong thing but not overly impressed, great restaurant great service tasty foods and good price dont know about the menu one of my friend who stay in shanghai help us to choose i like the fish soup and the black chicken dish with veggies very yummy, been there several times cool environment friendly staff and awesome and reasonably priced food around 60 yuan gotta try goat cheese the mashed potatoes and worms they are a bit expensive but definitely worth the experience, my favorite dish in this restaurant is roast fish its crispy and yummy last time order 2 roast fish for 5 people other dish like noodle also good
for those who want to try traditional yunan food this is the right place
good food and good price 
better make reservation before come especially weekend, the restaurant was bigger than expected during dinner time a bit crowded but we got a table immediately the food was delicious but very meat focused vegetarian options for main dishes seem very rare kind and helpful staff, the restaurant is always very busy which probably explains the lack of consistency in the dishes i visited around 5 times as my friends liked the restaurant and each time we went we ordered the same food some times i would like it sometimes it would be cold and dry the goats cheese was aways good tho, it was a little crowded during dinner so we got a table in the yard it is ok on a cool night food wise  good quite a few specialty offering which they can recommend service is good passable english not too expensive, had a very pleasant meal surrounded by locals having been recommended it by someone with local knowledge very nice variety of food with plenty that suits more western tastes of you pick carefully lots of vegetarian options also make sure you try the mashed potato  it is a unique experience in a good way, very traditional yunan style food with great value and excellent taste really enjoy the foodhighly recommended, good food great variety and great service the place was mobbed with people which tells you the popularity of this place, enjoyed a wonderful dinner with six people here the dark beer is recommended if you like dark beer there is a wide variety of options on the menu and the staff was attentive and friendly, went there with 11 friends and got a private ate a lot of stuff and drank lots too and got away paying only 100rmbperson great value for the money highly recommended if you can enjoy spicy food from southwestern china, this place serves food from all parts of china good price value for good quality the waiters dont speak english one of the owners is british so you can ask him to translate if needed on weekends you need to reserve, we went there with some friends living in shanghai we really recommend the restaurant nice food and prices are really reasonable, kind staff great place to eat with friends and even on a business trip loved the food nice menu to choose from, large but still cozy restaurant staff sometimes a lottle slow but you usually get what you ordered food is great just take you time with the menu special orders are working out aswell
great value i never paid over 120 per person
and the food is great, this is one my favourite yunnan restaurant in shanghai although i havent been to yunnan i think this place is better than any yunnan restaurant in shanghai and most of all the price is really reasonable
goat cheese and roast fish are 2 of the mustorder dishes i also like stirfry lotus root and the spicy black chicken
if you are an adventurer and would like to try something outofordinary do try their bullfrog and deepfried bee pupae looks like a worm though, i absolutely love this place when i lived in shanghai i would go often for lunch and dinner recently had the chance to organize a dinner for 25 people at this awesome restaurant and from the faces around the table everybody was more than happy with the food

i miss this place already, i visited here as it was close to where we were staying and had a fantastic meal very reasonably priced and service all fine etc the food was delicious especially the prawns with cashew nuts would definitely visit again, primarily serves yunnan style dishes and those i eat were very flavorful my favorites are sauteed lotus root fried beef and tea leaves the mint  licorice herbal tea is very refreshing find the restaurant upstairs the decorations cleanliness service all good, everything we ate was beautifully presented cooked and the service was friendly and prompt i think the trick here as i found with many restaurants with english barrier is to go with your favourites when you see them in the pictures the pork was great so was the brocoli, ive been to the lotus eatery several times what i especially like is that the english speaking owner greets his guests and is always helpful finding a table or placing an order for those who dont speak chinese especially when youre a big group i always felt welcome
the yunnan food is delicious the lotus and the beef salat with lemon are a must try i love the way prawns are prepared they are never too dry and overcooked what ive often experienced in china i also enjoy the fresh fruit juice watermelonorange mixed the waiters are always helpful and the price its very reasonable for the amount and quality you get one of my favorite places in shanghai, we loved everything we tried fresh spicy food with mint lemongrass and chillies mixed in layers of flavours i totally recommend, the service was a bit all over the place but most of the food was delicious and very spicy the beer was served at room temperature and they had no cold beer overall it was ok, great option for dinner with a big group try the fried kidney beans lotus roots mashed potatoes green salad and cold cucumbers all the dishes are excellent and if youre brave you can even order fried bees, went out for some food with colleagues found this place communication really difficult took five minutes to order a round of tsing tao beers food very weird in my opinion yes i know it is a regional restaurant offering regional food only a few things i wanted to eat from the menu, this is a charming restaurant with very good service the regional beers of yunnan add to this interesting experience dishes are relatively mild but with lovely flavours, ive spent the past two weeks eating with a mixed group of chinese and american business folks and each night has been at a different restaurant last night however was a true adventure and the most intriguing creative and flavorful of this trip so far once we got three little kittens shooed out the window we sat down to nearly a dozen dishes new to my palate i cant even remember all we ordered because we let the locals choose for us a decision for which im grateful you cant go wrong here be patient with the service order some beer sit back relax and savor these amazing flavors from south central china i felt like my mouth was tasting the ancient spice route, i dont eat much chinese food and dont eat meat in china so was a bit hesitant but my vegetarian friend recommended this place and i thought the food was great we actually ordered too much so took it home will definitely come back, took my family here while visiting its nice for larger groups so you can try more dishes menu is in english and has photos of the food definitely get the goat cheese and grandmas potatoes the staff is friendly but little english go here for a more local feel and half the price of other yunan restaurants, i was absolutely blown away by the flavor every dish had two of my new favorite things are now lotus root and morning glory i could not stop eating them i went with a big group of friends and there was something for everyone to enjoy we had a couple picky eaters and they tried everything we ordered the feel is relaxed and you can have a conversation across the table no problem everything was great i will definitely be returning, i might never have found this restaurant if i had never met a guy at the police station for the household registration incidentally i live close to this restaurant and that guy recommended me to try this restaurant from that point on this restaurant is a top choice whenever i want to order some food from home there is one other branch in yangzhai road and my favorite menu is their mushroom casserole crispy fried fish and spicy minced meat

if you are a hygiene freak forget this restaurant the price you pay is well suited with the quality of service they provide cheap to be honest i really dont like their service but the delicacy of their food always makes me come back or order food from this restaurant, i love this place its simple yet lovely and homey its cheap yet delicious the owners are extremely friendly the food is great

i honestly cant think of one single thing that i ate there and didnt like my favourite being the yunnan goat cheese yummy

its small though so make sure to book in advance or be ready to wait a little bit on busy nights totally worth it though, went to the lotus eatery on dingxi lu last weekend for the first time with a group of friends foreign and domestic not the easiest place to find and the front desk was a mess with reservations but a chilled atmosphere and pleasant decor helped offset things having lived in yunnan kunming for a year i have to say the food was quite authentic  from the goat cheese to the grandma mashed potatoes and the miao roasted fish could have used a lemon or tangy sauce and the lotus won me over nearly every dish was above expectation and the prices were respectable which is a rarity for yunnan restaurants in shanghai  where you are typically paying for visual stimulation leaving taste as a second or third  nod to lost heaven southern barbarian yunnan beer and yunnan liquor also available for a cheap price and while as exciting as qingdao or heineken was fun to drink local we were so impressed my girlfriend chinese and i walked to their other branch on xinhua and yangzhai this branch was all smoking smelled like it service staff took up the only available table on the first floor playing on their phones until we asked if we could have it as we were customers the food no where near the new location in taste and left totally disappointed

lotus eaterys dingxi lus location is a great place for a group of friends to experience yunnan and its cuisine, the food is very good considering the prices if you look for a good night out you can start here as the beers come very cheap as well always packed locals also which is often the best quality mark book ahead if you are a group, tasty and cheap describe the food here we have been here and to the yangzhai lu branch a few times and there are a few musthave dishes that we order  the omelette is excellent being fluffy and not oily though it can be a little salty grandmas potato mash is also good and the various chicken in chilli sauce are also delicious we usually end with a couple of bowls of spicy noodles with minced pork  these can be inconsistent though  sometimes the soup stock is very strong while at others it can be a little on the diluted side prices for two including beer or coke are usually around 140 rmb, this is not the place for pretentious foodie snobs who cream themselves at a hint of truffle oil this place is where you go for great authentic yunnan food  preferably with a big group so you can order lots of different dishes some of the standouts are the baked fish with chillies and peanuts  its amazing the fried beef with mint and of course the mushrooms the different mushrooms are seasonal and not all are always available so you have to ask which ones they have

this is the second branch of a great place on yangzhai lu i havent been to the original branch in ages because it got too popular with the ironic crowd and it was difficult to get a table the dingxi lu branch is about 10 times the size of the old one and although you will sometimes have to wait a few minutes getting a seat is not an ordeal

well worth a stopin  you wont be disappointed, simple but surprisingly tasty food service was nothing to shout about but adequate  the mashed potatoes was good hot pot black chicken was new and the grubs were interesting","bar",0.998010055479944
99,"table no 1 is in cool docks area in shanghai a nice place to visit and with many choices of restaurant especially summer time its a good choice
our first time to table no 1 and the interior is great and the waiter and service were good the main courses chosen for part of the company were however not good this evening meat choice why the rating cannot be higher than 3
might give a second try if have a chance in the summer, i love the vibe here think industrial meets the restaurant version of anthropologie walking in also made me want to stay at the hotel it resides in the waterhouse food was delicious i got the burrata as a starter  it was prepared very unusually almost like a dip the star of the show was the corn  marscapone pasta ill be dreaming of this for dessert i had the candy bar banana mouse service was good and majority spoke english im sure to be back my next trip to shanghai, it is always very disappointing to visit one of your favourite restaurants only to be decided we have visited this restaurant on a number of occasions and always been delighted we visited this weekend and clearly standards had slipped the food was lacking in flavour and lacking in attention to detail we might try again but i think we will wait for a while v, food smoked salmon tuna generous appetisers sole and bass mains excellent ambience superb  modern jazz cool and right level wonderful balconies with views and comfortable couchesgives the right mood if you didnt have it to begin with, the price was high
the portions small really small
the white wine warm
seriously we ordered cake for dessert and blob of sponge half the size of a golf ball the lamb rack was two slithers of meat on a bone the other dishes were lukewarm
no one asked if our dishes were ok although they got the point when the chips and cake were sent back
this was a birthday celebration and table 1 let us down

if you have special food requirements they are good gluten free ect, chef eric has a wonderful taste experience in store for you his black truffle soup was heavenly all of the entrees with a common start have wonderful tastes injected making them a wonderful taste journey to experience, this restaurant is really great  the food the service and the atmosphere all excellent i strongly recommend this place to eat  the staff are so friendly and efficient they treat you really well
we had a private room for my friends party and then night was so much fun all made possible by the way we were welcomed and treated at this restaurant  go you will love it, we found this restaurant located inside the waterhouse hotel here you can find some delicious european cuisine in a casual setting loved the tapas food here very simple tapas done to perfection love the modern gastrobar atmosphere, we arrived to a restaurant that was far from full but despite this we waited at least half an hour for a drink for starters we had the oysters which arrived dressed with far too much vinegar the tuna starter was delicious the pate was ruined by too many pickles and lacked flavour the pork ravioli as also tasty but quite heavy for a starter the brisket was tasty the lamb was ruined by the sauce which was far too sweet and the steak was average staff move swiftly around the restaurant but fail to take in when drinks are finished or offer you more even the water we had to get up and replenish ourselves there is one salt and pepper that is shared so if you want to season food you need to ask for it we had high expectations that missed the mark service was lousy and the food was far too expensive for the experience we had, we enjoyed a multicourse dinner with friends at table no  and really enjoyed every course the pork ravioli with broth and the roasted duck breast were particularly good along with the berry and chocolate souffle for dessert great food and a good price for the amount of courses we enjoyed, ive been here a few times now and given the competition in shanghai that speaks for itself pricing is fair according to local standards and the food is really excellent as much to look at as to eat service has been variable but it was perfect on this most recent visit
if you have managed to find the cool docks amidst all the building work reward yourself with a meal at table n�1 that is just next door, came here as a group of 7 and started with cocktails at the bar christophe the gm came over for a friendly chat and gave some recommendations
i had the smoked salmon followed by the veal and both were excellent also had a side of mashed potato which was possibly the best id ever tasted

after dinner we took our drinks up to the roof terrace which had great views
all in all and excellent experience in the cool docks area, overall high quality food great taste and presentation we love the desserts too service was really average with french gm only managed his service staff from a distance leaving his servers clearing plates without checking if we have done with the food waiters and supervisors knocking against your chair each time they walked past you to serve another table we were unfortunate that some taiwanese large group came for family gathering and the whole restaurant  only 2 other tables beside this group was very noisy with people shouting across conversation and children running around totally spoilt our dinning mood , amazing view on roof top bar the cocktail is good but snacks salad and oysters arent too bad either table 1 price isnt too expensive with the chef reputation, good food and service only let down by the location and decor the modernised industrial unit does not work for me as a fine dining venue in the cool docks its pricey for somewhere that does not have a view or a more appealing location, looking for a nice area for international cuisine in shanghai the cool docks is worth a try a well spread area with several restaurants  bars having both indoor as well as outdoor seating this place is interesting for an evening many tourists are seen in this area quite easily accessible from the bund transportation is never an issue when we spent an evening at the cool docks the area was bustling with activity though raining the restaurants were busy, menu was perfect considering the quality of the food price was a bargain staff spoke impressive english owner was very friendly i can fault this restaurant on nothing, we had the tuna and the salmon for starter and then the suckling pig and wagu as mains all dishes were packed with flavour and texture and some flavours that we were not expecting we would happily order again be warned after three courses we were very full but happy, had been told table no 1 was a great spot for either lunch or dinner and after a morning of walking the bund we needed somewhere away from the craziness we couldnt have been more pleasantly surprised tucked away in the developing area of the cool docks on the south bund and located at the water house boutique hotel table no 1 is a true delight outstanding service an extensive menu including a great lunch and dinner set menu and a fantastic wine champagne and cocktail list  its not to be missed jason atherton has out down himself we started with the tuna tartar and burrata salad two words  blown away portion size is excellent and the flavors textures and pairing with the bollinger bubbles was perfection for mains i had another starter  white asparagus risotto and my husband had the wagyu brisket  both excellent accompanied by a side of the recommended cream corn which is heaven a must for either lunch or dinner while in shanghai and we hear there is a roof top terrace open from 5pm we will most certainly be back thank you for an outstanding meal and experience, had a family brunch at table no1 this weekend good restaurant with nice atmosphere service is very friendly the french manager christophe was taking very well care of us menu propose a good selection of dishes and wines selection as well with reasonable prices im looking forward to come back again to try their dinner menu, dined in here on a number of occasions and this time once agin perfect beautiful decor world class food impeccable service if in shanghai you must try, located at the old cool dock area <u+8001><u+7801><u+5934>this restaurant serves mainly italian food it is nicely decorated n quiet generally however the taste of the food is passable, the restaurant is located in waterhouse hotel it was our first visit so we go with the 5 course set dinner the fb manager  mr christophe capron is friendly and nice he made excellent recommendation of wine i love every dish that was served especially the orange risotto cake the waygu beef that tear apart easily by fork and melt in the mouth and the citrus tart with fennel seed ice cream i highly recommend this place and i would definitely be back when i visit shanghai again, the restaurant is located in the waterhouse hotel area nice place with a lot of other restaurants all around the atmosphere is very enjoyable and quiet they welcome you with a slice of bread and pistachio dip excellent service is good and waitresses are very kind and helpful
the quality of food is good but i feel it is a bit overpriced more than 200$ for 3, greatest food at the bund love the pistachio dip and chocolate truffels the best beautiful location modern with asian touch together with the waterhouse hotel, i knew nothing about the provenance of this restaurant when we were invited to eat there recentlyi will leave that to other reviewers our hosts and we table for four all shared the entrees with wine recommend by the sommeliersomething many people balk at i knowbut it also worked perfectly from an extensive list to complement the mains we chose every scrap of food was consumedthe selection presentation ingredients and quantities almost exceptional we were enjoying the hospitality so much i almost neglected to look aroundbut when i did others seemed to be having just as pleasant a meal i believe the place is located somewhere a bit eclectic really who cares when the food and the ambience is so good, i usually dont write reviews but i absolutely had to after this meal i had the creamiest cheese ive ever had in my life for the appetizer then waygu steak was like ice cream  theres no need to chew if i could give it six stars i would its a must try if you come to shanghai

in addition christophe and his team has done an amazing providing the best service in shanghai, shanghai is bursting at the seams when it comes to options at meal times it is with opportunities such as the restaurant weeks which allow you the chance to try new and interesting restaurants without needing to spend too much although the area is going through some pretty drastic changes the restaurant itself is a calm cool hipster oasis against the construction work around the corner the staff were warm friendly and very attentive  in fact there was almost no space to breathe in between each course a slight negative maybe the food was delicious with fresh flavours and an excellent list of wines to accompany i would say that despite the five courses we were left a little hungry  the beautifully presented but meagre portions left me contemplating a burger on the way home, we have enjoyed jason athertons food since his days at maze where imho he excelled we went to this restaurant in the cool docks area because of his name its an up and coming area rather like pollen street and poland street so there is no view its urban shic and therefore relies on the food initial impressions were good modern restaurant in boutique hotel staff are attentive and friendly particularly christophe the md who hails from among others an old favourite the mirabel in mayfair cocktails were delicious as was the focaccia and pistachio spread olives were good too we had the tasting menu an oyster in vinegar was ok the pressed iberico cheek was very thin very bland and could have been any tinned meat in any case it was over powered by the over pickled veg the truffle risotto was stodgy rice in a pile with some truffle an insult to risotto the duo of veal was largely tasteless and the puree bland and tepid pre desert of grapefruit fine if you like grapefruit wife does i dont raspberry souffle excellent but why one between 2 with two teaspoons to eat and no plates almost inevitably i spilled some on my shirt jason atherton needs to either take a grip or ditch this place before it damages his reputation the menu seems to have been designed to be simple and foolproof a miscalculation im afraid, if you are out for a treat i def recommend to try table no 1
the place itself has a great decor made out of raw and industrial materials sort of minimal chic style kind of thing food is mouthwatering mise en place great and service excellent
on top of that cristophe the food  beverage manager is really professional and very friendly, i used to love table number 1 but we recently went for lunch and we left hungry we did the lunch special which is not cheap compared to other restaurants we spent more than 400rmb on lunch for 2 people the appetizer course was a few paper thin slices of smoked salmon and a clear broth the entree was laughable the steak was eaten in 3 bites and my fish consisted of 2 slices the size of a slice of cucumber both were accompanied by a few drops of purreebaby food and tiny cut up veggies that i make for my kids when they were babies when we left we had to go somewhere else to eat again because we were so hungry after lunch its such a disappointment because the flavor is good but the portions were just too tiny for the price they charge service was also terrible we had to ask multiple times for more water the check etc, visited the restaurant 2 years ago when i was in shanghai and was impressed by the quality of the food then as well as the pricing decided to go again on a recent trip and even though prices have increased significantly the quality of the food was so bad that i rather just remain hungry every single dish was soaked in oil much more than the usual chinese fare

i guess it was obvious when the restaurant was close to empty compared to full house 2 years ago stupid of me that i did not picked that up

when staff asked why i did not finish my food and i replied that its because food quality has fallen so much since i last visited he rolled eye at me seriously if you cant take feedback then dont ask, but i couldve possibly set my expectations too high the chicken skin was underwhelming and heavily battered biting into it we can taste the fat of the skin pork leg was good and skin nice and crispy creamed corn was good, we reserved table no1 with friends after work the ambiance was fantastic the taste of appetizer to dessert was fabulous  staff was really helpful and work in timely manner
i recommend this spot when you visit shanghai for food after business, ive been to a number of jason atherton places and i would say that while this still delivers it is not among my favorites the location is quite out of they way located by cool docks which is not convenient from almost anywhere in the city 

the food was good and i had no issues there atmosphere did not blow me away though so when i combine the long haul the fact that i can get food as good closer and that the atmosphere was nothing to draw me on its own i would have to say youre best off going to a place like commune social, my husband and i booked this as an anniversary treat having read previous views we were very excited about spending an evening eating great food and we came away greatly disappointed maybe our expectations were too high maybe having enjoyed a lunch at another establishment were we were truly spoiled we were expecting too muchhowever our experience does not match any of these other reviews

to be fair it got off to a bad start when the restaurant had lost our online booking looking at previous reviews this seems to be a common theme so maybe it is time this was sorted this would not have not been so bad had the attitude of the staff been better instead we were made to feel we were lying until we showed them evidence of the booking then we were just waved to a table

we selected the tasting plate i then asked for some advice on the best wines to have with each course and was told by the waitress that was too difficult and just to go for a red and white i have had similar menus at other restaurants and this has never been an issue we were then rushed through the courseswe had finished in less than 90 minutes to be honest we had left alot of the food the chicken skin was oily and left a strange taste in the mouth the pork was ok the corn mash seemed under seasoned and the desert was undercooked for the price we were paying this was poor value

the service was poorthe waitress did not even comment or notice that dishes were going back unfinishedi would expect someone working in an establishment like this would pay attention to their guests when my husband explained we were not happy with the food she basically ignored us and ran off

the manager came over as part of his service and he did seem shocked when my husband explained our issues however he was far too defensivetalking about how he had tried these dishes earlier he may have done but they were possibly cooked better and name dropping a previous employer to reinforce the idea he and not we knew what good food was he did take the service charge off tbh i would not have paid it and one of the dishes but it was still massively over priced i was so upset i had to walk out of the restaurant before my husband paid the bill i felt my special night had been totally ruined

overall this restaurant is over priced and offers a poor service there are very few places that i have had to write such a bad review but i feel i had write this one for those who like my husband and i read all the glowing reviews and end up wondering have we visited the same place, we reserved this restaurant with my wife for a special occasion because of the level of cuisine and ambiance and we were not disappointed the food style is based on a sharing concept that makes the dining a great experience and fosters the connection between people even in a fully booked venue the venue is inside the waterhouse hotel and the design is modern and casual but elegant at the same time
as we arrived the maitre d greeted us by name and with a flair that made the start of the evening a joy the restaurant has recently remodelled its interior making the dining space more open and lighted and it has improved service to a level that makes it a great place for an evening romance or otherwise
the wine and food were superb with good presentation and speed of service not too fast or slowjust perfect to inspire our already special evening the food is expertly prepared to allow for a sharing experience with taste and flavour and with excellent presentation the portions are just right to give you the perfect balance between flavour and size combining taste and texture with expertise
we closed the evening with a beautiful view of the river sipping on an after dinner cocktail on the terrace of the hotel
in short a perfect romantic evening, a lovely restaurant with excellent food i was dining solo and made to feel very welcome from the beginning and the environment was relaxed and comfortable the restaurant manager personally escorted me to the main road to hail me a taxi bookings not possible on a saturday night hand made chocolates at the end of the meal were a nice touch about <u+00a3>50 for a snack entree and main with a side plus two glasses on wine english speaking staff but did not feel at all touristy, came here while in shanghai an it didnt dissapoint good food good service and great cocktails special mention to rick and the restaurant manger who made us feel welcome, my husband  i dined in this restaurant with a friend we often dine in commune social and wanted to check out the table no 1
the restaurant was full thank god we made reservations we had a few drinks by the bar to start off cocktails were good staff were very professional  paid special attention to detail
the restaurant had a very rustic deco it looks like it is still under construction with its unfinished wall plaster  open ceiling
the manager was amazing very energetic  friendly did great recommendations of wine enjoyed his recommendations portions were quite generous ill say overall a good experience  will definitely drop by again, i have only given this 4 out of 5 due to my visit to the commune social after this which was in my opinion better
however table no 1 was a really interesting place to visit you walk in and are met with a very understated unfinished look but with a beautiful modern twist its a real gem the roof top bar has a phenomenal view of pudong it looks magical at night and its a must with a cocktail in hand
throughout the night i tried several of the cocktails on the menu and every single one of them were fantastic real attention to detail and they have a very skilled mixologist indeed shout out to rick hes very attentive and made us all feel very welcome and his cocktails are great
now to the food the food is really good as a party of 6 we ordered quite a few dishes and i cant say i had one that i didnt enjoy the sausage was fantastic and the pistachio dip was definitely up there with my favourites theres a rustic feel to dining experience which i loved desserts were great too and theres something for everyone to enjoy presentation was good and the service was fab we were always met with a smile and they were all very professional its well worth a visit if your on the bund, i have been to table no 1 many times for dinner but just tried the brunch for the first time it did not disappoint we shared the yoghurt with marinated berries and granola the eggs florentine and a tomato and onion salad with whipped feta the yoghurt was homemade and tasted homemade creamy texture and nicely tart berries were fresh and there was just the right amount of granola on top so that all the favors and textures came through the spinach on the egg florentine was perfectly cooked with still some crunch and not gritty at all the hollandaise was perfect the tomato salad was delicious very fresh red yellow and green cherry tomatoes with what looked like cream on the side but was feta flavored and also some tomato relish it all worked very well together and tasted like it had just come from the farm the only complaint i would have is that the latte i was served was tepid and also in a cup that was a little too small for my taste i will definitely return for brunch when i am looking for something on the lighter side and will recommend to friends, we went there last night after en exhausting travell to shanghai
the restaurant is incredible nicely designed as part of the waterhouse hotel  which shall also be incredible from what we hear
the restaurant has a super nice atmosphere staff is well trained and the food keeps all its promises
we ordered some starters incredible maindish wagyu beef and dessert
this was all very nicely cooked and the meat tender as it can be
all was super niced the dessert was a bit too much of experimental however never mind im not a big dessert fan anyway but still very nice
all together we payed 1300 for the two of us including a bottle of very nice wine so in my opinion it was every penny spent more then worth
btw the bar does also nice cocktails, i start this review by revealing my foodie travels on this trip will take me to 3 of his group restaurants starting here in shanghai
my chef friend started with a listed san pellegrino top 100 restaurant with ultra violet but at $640 nzd per head there wouldnt be a lot left for the holiday
so this industrial dining space is located in huangpu in a contemporary hotel with a must go to roof top bar
may the maitre d must be commended very delightful and very proud to be the face of the brand in fact i was surprised she hadnt had the opportunity to be inducted first in a flag ship restaurant she made us feel welcome and our night began
the shared plates were a resemble size but lacked a little punchy flavour that you might expect being in northern china the desserts were well worth ordering especially the range of petit fours they were cool
perhaps more focus is on commune social and i do hope kensington social due to open in sydney gets some of the stretched lovin

note | typing club in bethnel green london is the one in the group to try, this place has been in my top 3 for moderneuropean western food in shanghai since it opened its sister restaurant is excellent as well its been a while since i last visited but my gfs birthday prompted a special meal and it didnt disappoint shanghai suffers from the fatigue of good restaurants deteriorating after the first year when the opening star chefs move onwards and upwards not so with athertons places he obviously attracts and retains the talent
i recommend the pork shoulder but its all good
the chinese staff rating as very good for china and the manager is attentive friendly and professional, weve lived in shanghai for 2yrs and have been meaning to come here for quite some time based on recommendations by friends and we wished we had come here earlier a beautiful and relaxing atmosphere was matched with delicious food and fantastic service especially from may the restaurant manager the foie gras beef tongue and tuna tar tar were some of the amazing dishes pricing is about on par with some of the other high end restaurants around shanghai and definitely worth a visit also try jason athertons other restaurant the commune social our favourite brunch in this city, one of the best european restaurant in shanghai the food was very tasty with many ingredients in one dish the kid menus pasta was served in a very unique way and every dish was decorated nicely, ambience  great set in an old warehouse turned boutique hotel and situated in a quieter part of the bund brown tone large glass tungsten lamp gives it a cool industrial vibe

cocktails  did not try but lobby bar outside not in restaurant looks cool rooftop sounds cool from other reviews

food  mostly good the mash potato with bone marrow sprinkles was fantastic tuna tartare was very tasty the pork shoulder was very generous and rich in flavor dont have this if you cannot take fat  this is well loaded

wine  pretty sparse list passable not great check if you can byob

service  the big letdown consistent with other reviews the staff was poorly trained got our main orders wrong brought chicken out instead of pork  not sure how that could heard wrong they all looked indifferent when waved at and gruff  brusque in their replies as an apprentice of gordon ramsey of hells kitchen fame no less i had expected a minimum standard from jason atherton but was soundly disappointed

worth coming back again in a few month where hopefully service has been brought up to the level this restaurant deserves, the venue is located by the cool docks an old fashioned area perfectly suited for upscale restaurants targeted towards expat customers the restaurant is well decorated with an industrial theme however voices and noises seem to echo very well around the restaurant although it wasnt loud enough to be bothersome it was certainly noticeable especially given the modest amount of seats available in the restaurant space the appetizers were amazing and full of flavor many of the european dishes seem to take on an interest asian twist very refreshing the main courses were great too however not particularly as impressionable as their small plates and desserts we ordered the coffee panna cotta for dessert and it was delicious i loved the way their dessert seemed to be made out of contrasting components that together combined to create a very sophisticated flavour for their dessert the staff was my favorite aspect of my dining experience the waiters were very polite and courteous and were quick to service when needed the managers and chef were all very friendly and personable and all made more than their needed rounds to accommodate and converse with us our interactions felt like it was between good friends and the conversations felt very comfortable and organic i would suggest everyone to their bar upstairs after dinner great view and a refreshing selection of drinks, table no 1 is situated near the bund but dont come here for the view there isnt much of one instead come here for the rich food and attentive service
the food is geared towards plates meant for sharing 2 of us shared 4 dishes charcuterie foie gras tuna tartare potato mash and were full by the end of the meal
we opted for cocktails instead of wine and didnt regret our choice dessert ice cream was nothing spectacular
i would recommend this place for people looking for a quiet but sinful meal","dumpling restaurant",0.97887363313344

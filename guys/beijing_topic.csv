1,"the food is prepared to the point the service outstanding and the wine compliments the food at his best, we had a wonderful dining experience at trb from start to finish there were so many nice little surprises from the welcome glass of champagne to the delicious cookies packed in a box to take home my husband and i ordered a different number of courses and without saying a word they brought him a bowl of soup on the house so that he had something to enjoy while i ate my salad the food was unique beautifully prepared and absolutely delicious, it is a magical place with quite a chinese feel updated with western renovation the french food is probably one of the best in beijing which is of good standard it offers a pleasant experience of east meet west and the place will be a good place for entertainment the bill might set you back a bit though and is perhaps the price to pay for good enough french cuisine in a place where standard is still needing improvement, ok it is not an easy place to find but worthy the effort it is located inside a hutong in a 600 years old temple beautiful place with an elegant mix of old and modern china the food is great one can choose a la carte menu or set menu nevertheless what impressed us most was their service top of the class it is a kind of restaurant that would be great in any other place in europe or north america world class congrats for trb team, our last evening in beijing after 35 years and we picked the trb at the place to say good bye to this tremendous city everything was just perfect food wine and the definitely best service in beijing thanks trb team for all the great evenings during the last years and especially for this unforgettable last one, what a great find fantastic restaurant in a great location we came here as a party of 8 and all had such a lovely time we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of champagne and some appetisers the service was excellent and the food very western we paid for 3 courses and were served around 6 we also all got a tin of baked french goods to take home will definitely come back when in beijing next, the quality of the food is good to great

service is subpar at best slow and forgetful waiters slightly arrogant receptionist one of these overweight old guys who thinks being arrogant equals good service and makes guests feel welcome

when leaving the restaurant we had to yell to get a waiter to show up and bring us our coats no smile or thank you when leaving the restaurant at 3000 cnyrmb for lunch for 4 people the service is a joke

overall experience = not worth the money, had dinner last night family of four with two young kids the staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating providing custom food and drinks for the girls from the moment we walked into the beautiful courtyard until we were driven back to our hotel in their private car everything was exquisite our family welcomed a high end evening away from the hustle and bustle of beijing next time im in town this will be on my list again thank you ignace and team for a memorable evening, i made another visit to one of our favorite french restaurants that happens to be 8000 miles from home

in ten words or less temple restaurant beijing is worth the trip my wife and i have been going about three times a year i guess that makes us regulars

i arrived a few minutes before noon this is an important detail because it helps track the pacing of the meal i had a tasting menu because i asked them to make all the selections for me

on this trip i was dining on my own the restaurant was pretty full for lunch although i was seated at a table for one the next table consisted of four stylish young women who meet the ladies who lunch description

the meal started with a glass of champagne as i observed other tables being served a sparking wine on the house was standard practice for everyone

the amuse bouche was a zabiyone with a cooked egg served in a footed porcelain bowl

fois gras pate was the first official course the slices were long and thin as if sliced from a tart they included various toppings including popping sugar this was served with a chinese rice wine that was very similar to a sauternes i ate it in tiny bites closing my eyes as i did it was very good

next a seafood course arrived accompanied by a spanish albarino wine this included sea urchin three large lumps of caviar cauliflower puree and burnt califlower for real

next another seafood course followed this was accompanied by a white burgundy wine the primary ingredient was icelandic halibut yet it was served with two triangular ravioli the wrapper was thinly sliced radish not pasta the filling was mashed potato wow

its now 100 pm

next the meat course arrived this was a piece of wagu beef about 5 x 1 x 1 this doesnt sound large but the cumulative effect of the multiple courses and the accompanying dishes made it more than enough it also included wagu beef carpaccio and a small clear dish of short ribs topped with mashed potatoes although its an overused expression this dish was a taste explosion each little bite had great flavors i ate slowly

the meat course was served with a shiraz cabernet blend from australia

by this time it was about 130 pm

dessert followed it was served with a muscat dessert wine the dessert was their interpretation of mango cheesecake this involved seven inch tall cylinders of mango sliced into ribbon each was stuffed with cheesecake there was a dense mango sauce in the plate when you ran a spoon through it the sauce stayed separated

its now 145 pm

the restaurant has a tradition they serve a small round chocolate cake about 3 inches in diameter they take a photo which is developed and presented in a cardboard frame by the time the bill arrives at the table of four women next to me each was given their own copy of the photo

from my point of view this is about as perfect as perfect can get its about 200 pm when the meal is over

are there drawbacks although the restaurant is located in the center of beijing it is in the middle of nowhere i wandered in one direction a couple of visits ago and eventually found a subway station this time i asked the hotel for directions they suggested i circle the building and head right which i did

this deposited me in a hutong a neighborhood of one story homes on narrow streets similar to alleys no street signs but since this is china i probably wouldnt have been able to read them anyway however all the homes were freshly painted in a uniform grey and very well maintained for those familiar with brooklyn it was the park slope of hutongs eventually i found a main street and a subway station three trains later i was back on familiar ground

as you can tell its worth the trip, have lunch or diner here is a perfect combination of visiting a temple of same age than the forbidden city and tasting kind of the franch style food i love both chinese history and le cuisine francais their foods are refined the service is the best of beijing waiters are attentive but discreet the ambiance is intimate trb is where i go for lunch or diner with my family or best friends as often as possible
i highly recommend for both who live in beijing and who visit beijing, the set menu price is average and affordable food was above average nice presentation of food but kind of lack of some wow factors the dining experience was quite casual as well, went there with my family went to celebrate my daughters birthday its still as good as it was but more chinese guests now than foreigners, we ate here on our last night in beijing the food was offered with a nice variety of 35 course selections and my boyfriend asked for the chef recommended wine pairings for each course i am a very picky eater and i found every bite absolutely delicious more outstanding was the service from the moment we stepped inside until we left in the restaurant car every detail of our experience was artfully choreographed the ambiance was intimate modern and sophisticated and we were even presented with a going away cake for desert with pictures of us to take away later i highly recommend this restaurant is you are looking for an exceptional experience, i have now been in this place 3 times for dinner  brunch and i have to give my compliments to the team there for doing a great job
interesting but a bit hard to find location hidden in an old temple compound
lovely interior design run by a french maitred  chef couple who train and lead there team very well surly one of the best western fine dining restaurants in beijing, the total experience is special and we enjoyed the food service and we think value for money is also great by international city standard

venue
this place is hard to find as it hidden in a narrow hutong near forbidden city just when we thought we got lost we saw many luxury cars parking outside a temple looking door here we found it the road lead to the restaurant is very classic beijing and nothing fancy but once you arrived you will a small heaven hidden inside the temple is peaceful and calm with some interesting sculptures and a art gallery the actual restaurant is build inside a temple as you can tell by the roof we loved the venue a lot

service
let me out this way apart from the staff english is not perfect everything else associated with the service is staff speak very fluent english just with local accent nothing wrong at all

to compare the service my husband and i even thought it is better than two twomichelinstarred places we have been recently one in la and one in london

flawless and with a personal touch you can even feel the greeting from the kitchen as chef prepared special desert to welcome us as first time visitor

food and wine
there is a serious wine book all in english plenty good choices and we tried a chinese red wine as a test and it was very nice

food is fine dining standard with plenty options the only criticism or improvement advice i would say on the food is that it is a bit fine dining as usual what i mean is that we have similar food in all other cities and it feels lack of identity

the food itself is fantastic but lack of innovation and creation in my view when opening a fine dining restaurant in one of the most historical city including history of food i would expect more from the menu something creative something with a eastwest twist and something different from a fine dining restaurant in other city of the world

i appreciate that local chinese might like pure authentic french food so my above comment is purely driven by personal preference

all in all great experience at a reasonable price by international standard we would love to come back next time in beijing and hope to see some surprise in menu, i could write a book on why i feel the restaurant is the best i have experienced in the last 20 months of my expat life here for starters the entrance and ambience the restaurant is in a temple can u beat that prime location and once ur in u forget ur anywhere in beijing great food awesome surprises and fantastic service met the general manager stephen here by the way he also manages the other trb bites and he remember me from my last visit from the other restaurant 2 months back generous and intuitive service i am generally critical about dining experiences but they did not let me find any faults again ask him to recommend a meal and he will not let u down the staff is eager to assist the local and a few expat staff are proactive rare in china amazing dining experience, if youre looking for worldclass cuisine you cannot miss this gem incredible wine selection that will drop the jaw of any wine enthusiast excellent meats fish and fowl highly recommended also its beautiful inside and very tastefully decorated, it was an experience which cant be expressed in words i had gone there as my wife booked a table for us in order to celebrate our anniversary right from the moment we entered we were pampered to the core by its wonderful staff the food was simply incredible and its the best french cuisine and international cuisine one can have right from the complimentary starter snacks to the desert every piece of food item was served with love compassion and the most exquisite toppings i had the best salmon till date in my life and also the special complimentary delicacies made our anniversary a really special one the best table was kept for us every time we were served a dish we were reminded by its lovely and adorable staff that its our anniversary in the end we were served a surprise cake and a gift trust me i have the experience of dining in some of the best fine dining restaurants across the world but trb is not a restaurant its an one of its kind experience one can have in beijing right from its exquisite location inside hutong to the splendid collaboration between modern decor and ancient chinese architecture everything was just perfect their staff including sara ignace ricardo were simply fabulous and we never exprienced a better service than this, i was there for a business dinner with twelve others but the service was still efficient even though we didnt order the same menus the portions are small so you dont feel overstuffed there were also nice surprises such as i got a bowl of icecream with strawberries even though i just ordered decaf cappuccino for dessert the presentation of the dishes are very delicate and artistic while the food itself is tasty meat not overdone fish moist and vegetables still have a bit of bite to them, we returned to temple restaurant beijing trb during our most recent visit to beijing bottom line if we can go to just one restaurant in beijing this it it its one of the major reasons we keep returning to beijing from the philadelphia area

we have always come for lunch they do a nice three course lunch for 198 rmb which is about $29 usd in reality its about a seven course lunch counting all the extras they throw in i dont think anyone gets everything but everyone gets a few extras plan on two hours plus fyi they usually throw in a glass or two of wine

on this occasion we brought a guest everyone ordered different courses my if and i left the choice up to the staff we were waited on by vivian and alvin when you keep coming back from 8000 miles away we take the time to learn names

here are the highlights

they started us with an amuse bouche of four small tastes each under an inch in diameter this was accompanied by domaine chandon sparkling wine fyi the lvmh folks produce this in china

next came a porcelain bowl on a pedestal it contained an egg dish which my wife described as a variation on zabigone this was another extra

now time for the first course one person had the gravlax cured salmon covered in dill sliced at the table i had this oyster and caviar dish with oysters tempura on the side it was served in the largest oyster shell ive ever seen i took a photo with a pen across the top to show the scale my wife had a scallop and caviar dish all of these were great

next came another extra it appeared to be crab ravioli yet instead of using pasta the wrapping was thin slices of radish wow the disk in the center was powdered seaweed

time for entrees i had the beef which was about an inch by an inch by about five inches long it was accompanied by two small disks of wage beef carpaccio served on a section of bone when i shared the wage beef they brought out a third disk so we could each have one

another of us had the lamb that was quite good too my wife had the halibut about the same sized portion as my beef i tried it and it was great

time for dessert i had a dense chocolate cake with chocolate disks on top it was accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by powdered chocolate our guest had a meringue bowl with milk that was somehow turned into solid sheets ice cream held it together

my wife had the standout dessert it was mango cheesecake only the mango was tiny tubes with cheesecake piped inside it was served in a pool of mango sauce

then small pastries arrived another extra there were three per diner finally they presented a small shiny round chocolate cake this is a standard thing they do because its included in the photo they take of diners at the end of the meal moments later a printed color photo is presented to diners in a cardboard frame

can this get any better its hard to believe but the french couple who run the place chef and maitred were both back home in france for a short break they were able to deliver this quality of food and service through the rest of their team that is amazing

you can tell we love the place we keep coming back, the good romantic classy environment good service english and chinese wonderful food presentation unique food the bad small food portions wasnt very impressed by taste, beautiful restaurant set in a temple that previously a television factory superb service very good food extensive wine list, i had come to trb for weekend brunch several times and thought the experience was great the service was always exemplary and the layout was neat  spacious atomsphere is cosy and is expected for fine dining the food portions were sizeable but was taste was ok coming for weekend brunch provides the best value, great food nice room and fantastic service from arvin and his team  highly recommended even the loud and rude tourists seated next to us didnt take away from the night, came to this place couple of times service is great food portions could be little bigger place for a celebrations arvin the server was attentive, we had been to trb a few times in the past but those experiences did nothing to prepare us for what we would experience on our most recent visit

the setting remains one of the loveliest in beijing and the wonderful staff provides impeccable service

shortly after being shown to our table we were greeted by oliver i hesitate to call him our waiter because his warmth sincerity dedication and attention to detail were so natural and complete that he was much more like a combination of guest relations officer and old friend throughout the meal he went to great lengths to ensure that we had the best possible experience and yet it all seemed effortless to him

service is important but every restaurant lives and dies by its food the food at trb is among the most spectacular anywhere indeed the offerings on the business set lunch compared favorably to some of the most creative cuisine we had tasted at jose andress las vegas restaurant e with a rising accent over the e while molecular cuisine sometimes can feel contrived there was nothing gimmicky about what we were served everything was done in the name of flavor and everything was excellent moreover it was all achieved for around rmb200 per person

it is now apparent that trb is a destination dining establishment not only is a visit to beijing incomplete without a meal at trb people might want to start thinking about traveling to beijing with the sole purpose of eating at trb, everything about my lunch at trb was wonderful from the careful attention of the staff to fine detail of the foods presentation i look forward to returning and sharing this experience with other friends in beijing, sometimes you have an experience that is so exceptional that it causes you to recalibrate everything that came before with new eyes such was our visit to trb on my recent birthday every dining experience i had before it is now lessened i have dined before at fine restaurants including several michelin star places in both the south of france and the usa nyc but our experience at trb was second to none we arrived and were asked if we wanted a drink at the bar or to go direct to our seats and chose to go right in no problems or delays that seem to have been experienced by some other diners i ordered one of the taster meals with wine pairings my wife ordered some vegetarian dishes from the a la carte menu the food was of a consistent high standard throughout easily matching my admittedly limited previous michelin star experiences in both quality and quantity the food was spectacularly tasty the portion sizes were lets say �more than filling� the bread supply alone was enough to feed a small family but that wasn�t what made it special from the second we started there were so many little touches that made the evening memorable to mention just one because i was having the taster menu i had one more course to eat than my wife the staff recognized this they didn�t say anything but without asking prepared a small extra vegetarian dish for her for free so that she had something to eat at the same time i did that attention to detail is just stunning to cap things off at the end the wine waiter asked which of the wine pairings i had enjoyed the most and then promptly brought us back two generous glasses of it the level of conversation from the wait staff was friendly but unobtrusive and they just hit that fine balance exactly right the sommelier was excellent � knowledgeable but not keen to bore us to death with it at the end after we collected our coats probably having drunk too much a waiter walked with us down the road until we were safely inside a taxi and on our way home tripadvisor doesn�t do 6 stars if it did this was a six, we joined some friends for a dinner party and were immediately impressed by the temple grounds and the intimate setting of the restaurant  like much of beijing rich in history the dining area was dimlylit with pleasant ambiance the team of servers were quite a bit more attentive than what one normally experiences in beijing and their insistence on englishonly even with myself and a chinese patron attempting to speak mandarin chinese was a unique feature as well the food arrived early and often in smallbutfrequent courses of upscale western cuisine that left the palate intrigued and satisfied and various surprises that were welcome treats while trb clearly targets wealthy expats as its clientele niche we were pretty astounded at the price of the meal and also at the graciousness of our friends for hosting the meal in relation to the quantity of food flavor notwithstanding to sum the experience of the restaurant and the food itself would yield something greater than four stars and the pricing and overthetop westernized service detract only slightly however the kicker was literally that while i was seated at an outward corner of our table a member of the waitstaff kicked one of the legs of my chair each time while passing by  no less than around fifteen times throughout the meal  an annoying distraction from an otherwisegood experience if the staff tried as hard at navigating the bustling restaurant interior as they did at speaking english this would have merited a fourstar or very good experience, dining in a refurbished templeenough said the restaurant was pretty hard to find so make sure you have good directions from the restaurant before you head out it seems as though you are going through alleyways and then its off to the side but walking into the space is just amazing the food truly wonderful unique takes in eastern and western cuisine everything was delicious the service was amazing as well and we were given a special welcome to china dessert courtesy of the restaurant it was so memorable and i would definitely go back, we have an excellent lunch at the trb in beijing the service is outstanding the menu was extremely criative and food very very good  never expected a restaurant at this level in beijing , every time when im in beijing i must visit trb the service by sarah benahmed was first class the food is very well crafted and it was a very enjoyable and happy experience the journey to get to the restaurant is a bit of mystery and fun thanks the chef frank who always gives thoughtful surprises, we went for sunday brunchits a little bit of a challenge to find but the treasure is worth it
the temple grounds are impressive that being said it was cold and snowing so we spent most of our time inside
the staff is really topnotch gracious helpful and very cheery and quick to help us when our daughter  at her first bigtime restaurant dumped her water all over the table
the food is spectacular  both visually and to taste the menu is set up to be able to order 5 of anything  which gave the girls a lot of flexibility theyre 12 and 13 while my wife and i experimented more
the breads alone are a meal you really do have to try everything
we thought we were done  then came out the extras  both dessert nibbles and drinks
brunch was a 3 hour event  and easily could have been longer
overall an incredible place for a truly wonderful meal, poss one of the best restaurant experiences i have ever had amazing food staff ambience whatever i write couldnt do the restaurant and staff justice you must go, excellent european food with an impressive wine selection with attentive and generous service in a spectacular historic temple complex that has been restored in an authentic and respectful way will come again at my next visit, ate here for sunday brunch with the family good service even though the staff kept dropping cutlery in the background

wine pairing was not that great given the two of us had different dishes though from the same course was more of a course pairing than individual menu pairing

staff were attentive and know when to step in and when not to do so looking after our little one very well

food was great just would have been nice to have been explained the each course more some were and some were not

soup had a some great flavours but poured into a cold soup bowl

would return again as over all experience was a 910, the restaurant is very classy and the dishes were beautifully presented the whole experince included the waiters presenting us the food at the table and adding hors d�oeuvres on the house the actual flavour of the food wasnt anything exciting and the portions were small the service was good but it took a long time for the dishes to come and the prices were extremely high nice for a onetime experience, nice setting but the food was overpriced and quite bland if you are visiting beijing better to spend time discovering all the authentic chinese delicacies, excellent multicourse dinner with friends in a reserved room for eight very difficult to find trb which is part of the charm immediately upon entering a choice of some special drinks we finished off the bottles of 71 and 73 armagnac other choice whiskeys and wine some wines were not available the service and food were excellent and the wine decanters are entertaining overall price was midrange 23000usd with nice drinks in the private room will return with another small group dont miss oh yeah you even get photos at the end of dinner that the staff take and develop, the tasting menu was lovely and i hear they rotate the offerings every few weeks however the star of the show was the service we went to temple to celebrate my sisters birthday and it was the highlight of our day the staff was extremely attentive and pleasant i can not say the same for many of the high end restaurants of beijing sarah the matred was very friendly and remembered my sister and details about her from when she went the restaurant with coworkers >6months before she helped us select a reasonably priced amazing wine the other staff were also great we were waited on by vivienne and 2 men whos name i did not catch will definitely return on future trips to beijing
logistics
 its a little bit hard to find as it is buried in a hutong and there isnt great signage we used google maps but i would not head out without clear directions and writing the name of the restaurant in chines so that people on the street can help you when we finally got to the restaurant there was a large door directly to the street which we had come to but were not permitted to go through so maybe it was just closed when we came if so then it is easy to get to
 the staff speaks english in varying degrees but enough to get whatever you need and if the person you are speaking to does not understand they will find someone to help
 if you are on a budget go for lunch we had a lovely 3 course tasting menu plus the usual extra courses that come with a tasting menu a bottle of wine and 2 bottles on water for less than $200 for 3 people
 the water was very expensive >10usd for ~1l, thank you trb for another unforgettable culinary experience all dishes were expertly prepared and plated we loved every single course especially the sweets the restaurant itself was not easy to find but definitely worth the effort, we have been remiss in not posting this review earlier we visited for lunch in late september the serenity the service the food  all spectacular temple has hit upon the secret to leaving guests with the feeling that the pricey lunch is priceless the surprises throughout the visit cava as your friendly and exceptionally professional staff first come to your table complimentary was that the appetizer no that was a complimenary small course dessert what we ordered and also a small cake drizzled with the words welcome to china wed let on it was our first trip not realizing why our server had asked do not let fears of small portions enter your mind it was nigh onto impossible to finish the desserts when we got to them bravo temple owners may you continue to succeed and may you in your kindness ensure to share the rewards of that success with your very deserving staff, my husband and i had dinner at trb to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary we had a wonderfully memorable evening  awesome food excellent service and lovely ambience

the dishes at trb are unique delicious and beautifully presented

we had the 5 course set menus our favourite dishes are  apple foie gras lobster  beetroot grilled oyster lobster  pork belly the milk  blueberry and chocolate desserts were yummy too

although it was a 5 course menu they surprised us with appetizers in between some courses which were delightful and delicious

we were very impressed by their warm friendly staff and impeccable service a little pricey but highly recommended one of the highlights of our trip to beijing

print a map for the taxi driver we didnt print one and our taxi driver had difficulty finding the restaurant as it is located in the hutong and the place is not well lit at night, everything about this experience was spectacular the venue is beautiful and the service was top notch you can either pick one of the recommended set menus or pick your own i picked my own along with the wine pairing even though some of the options were outside of my comfort zone i enjoyed everything there are a lot of little delightful surprises throughout the experience this is more than just a meal i loved every moment and felt welcome as solo traveler highly recommend, i had a great evening here i was by myself and the staff was very friendly and did everything they could not to make me feel alone  the atmosphere is lovely its a beautiful setting and very peaceful

though i had to wait 30 minutes for my table this was compensated for with generous top ups of bubbles the food was very good really enjoyed it the staff came with good recommendations for wine as well

they are paying attention to detail a tiny stool for my bag was brought over the gm came to say hello and check if all was ok very attentive

after dinner getting a taxi took a while but again i was comfi waiting at the bar while my drink got topped up

it is a place thats not easy to find make sure you print a map for your taxi driver but once you find it youll love it, i have heard of the restaurant and always wanted to go the reservation online is convenient and got a response immediately the restaurant is also in contact through messaging to remind me and to arrange delays due to traffic

upon arrival we were greeted with free proseco a treat i only enjoyed in italy the chef will also randomly give us appetizers from now and then which were completely exquisite i had a gel like thing on a biscuit that explodes in my mouth with delicious tomato juice the texture and the experience was fantastic its chefs tasting menu or a mixed and match tasting menu only i had a two course but we were provided with surprise courses soup dessert and a cake at the end

the restaurant is in a restored temple and it is a beautiful courtyard that people can visit there was also a movie projected on a wall outside the story of the restoration beautiful sculpture and a gallery with beautiful exhibit great experience just on its own it is quite pricy and french tiny amount but the food service and experience all worth it, since 2 years ago i visited trb for 4 times already for family gathering friends gathering and business appointments
the location of trb is a fun for all visitors to explore bj in a little deeper manner
the dishes and environments are excellent nothing much to add
all 4 visits were great, saw friends post pictures of this restaurant  finally got the chance to try it

must admit that the food was very decent while the service was impeccable

we ordered a bottle of sparkling  the staff still gave us some wine to accompany our dishes

the food speaks for itself while we just cannot say enough about the service

for foodies  truly worth the experience, housed in an old courtyard sitting next to the wall of the forbidden city the restaurant has a stunning view  a very nice choice for dinner dates and special occasions
the mix and match menu is a great idea everything is delicious and elaborate with the exception of the dessert which was rather at the level of a midrange restaurant
very attentive service and surprises for those celebrating a birthday
portions are rather small expected at such a classy venue but somewhat disappointing that the mains are the same size as appetisers  especially that dishes were so tasty, this is a great change of pace from your typical beijing fare and from your typical fancy food i had trepidation beforehand because portion sizes at fancy restaurants are usually small and im never quite sure what im eating at trb they bring out not only your meal but a plethora of free appetizers and even alcohol the waitstaff was attentive and spoke great english the location cant be beat nestled in beside the forbidden city i highly recommend this for a nice evening out","steakhouse",0.999805268778834
10,"siji minfu which literally means people min are in happiness fu all year round siji four seasons of the year provides the best beijing duck with reasonable costs cny198 for the whole duck other dishes have been modified to better accommodate flavors of people from different parts of the world yet still authentic chinese food not some fusion that has lost the spirit of chinese food another thing i need to mention is the service they provide is really of high quality because of this you need to make a reservation but only before six oclock if i remember it right or only for private rooms not tables in the hall or go there before 5pm otherwise you will end up waiting for up to 23hrs, wir haben etwa 40 minuten gewartet das restaurant hat ein wartenummernsystem und es lauft alles sehr organisiert das interieur ist gemutlich traditionell
zum anfang hat mich extrem verargert dass zwar die karte unter anderem auf englisch ist aber die bedienung kein wort sprach oder verstand in china ist das ja nicht ungewohnlich aber in einem so gut bewerteten restaurant hatte ich das jetzt erwartet

wir kommen wieder, this is my first experience eating peking duck and what a place to do it it was superb so was the beef pork and pepper kung pao chicken and strawberry and blueberry drink all of it was delicious and visually nicely prepared the duck was superb the skin was crispy and the meat was tender with the various sauces and accompanying ingredients the overall effect was fun varied and tasty and when the bill came i was pleased that the total was under what i expected, we were greeted with smiles the moment we stepped into the resto food is no doubt delicious you should try their noodles and meat balls o<u+fe0f>, la prima sera a pechino avevamo appuntamento con degli amici che ci hanno portato in questo locale che e stata per noi una sorpresa assoluta tanto da esserci poi tornati lultima sera prima di ripartire un locale abbastanza caratteristico con un ottimo servizio e che nonostante fosse affollato il sabato abbiamo atteso circa 1 ora per sederci riescono a servirti abbastanza velocemente la prima sera abbiamo preso un assaggio di antipasti tutti molto buoni una zuppa di abalon ed una di carne squisite e soprattutto l anatra che e il loro piatto forte labbiamo scoperto la prima sera ovviamente come loro usanza lanatra viene servita con una sorta di sfoglie che vanno riempite con lanatra stessa e salsa e ortaggi vari che ti portano in piattini appositi ad ogni commensale il suo piccolo porta vivande la seconda sera io e mia moglie abbiamo pagato il corrispettivo di 22 euro una cena eccellente ricca con due birre cinesi da mezzo litro ognuna da non perdere assolutamente, when in bejing eat the beijing duck and this is the place to do it no reservations can be madeneeded just show up and take a seat and nibble on some snacks whilst awaiting seating and the wait is worth it, �� ����� ���� ������ ����������� ��� ���� �������� ����� � �� ������ � ������ ������ ����� ������������� � ���� ����� �������������� ������� ����� ��� ������ � ����������� ������� ����������, <u+98df><u+7269><u+6c34><u+6e96><u+4e0d><u+932f><u+70e4><u+9d28><u+6c92><u+6709><u+5f88><u+9a5a><u+8277><u+53ea><u+662f><u+5317><u+4eac><u+7684><u+6a19><u+6e96><u+6c34><u+5e73><u+3002><u+70b8><u+91ac><u+9eb5><u+5f88><u+597d><u+5403><u+5176><u+4ed6><u+6dbc><u+83dc><u+7092><u+83dc><u+4e5f><u+90fd><u+5f88><u+597d><u+3002><u+503c><u+5f97><u+63a8><u+85a6><u+7684><u+662f><u+6dbc><u+62cc><u+8c46><u+82d7><u+597d><u+50cf><u+662f><u+9019><u+500b><u+540d><u+5b57><u+3002><u+4e00><u+5b9a><u+8981><u+8a66><u+8a66>, <u+5317><u+4eac><u+670b><u+53cb><u+5e36><u+6211><u+5011><u+53bb><u+4e86><u+9019><u+4e00><u+9593><u+70e4><u+9d28><u+5e97><u+9673><u+8a2d><u+5178><u+96c5><u+3002><u+9664><u+4e86><u+70e4><u+9d28><u+5916><u+6211><u+5011><u+9ede><u+4e86><u+5e7e><u+500b><u+5c0f><u+83dc><u+50f9><u+9322><u+4e0d><u+841b><u+592a><u+8cb4><u+98df><u+7269><u+7cbe><u+7dfb><u+597d><u+5403><u+53bb><u+5317><u+4eac><u+4e0d><u+9632><u+4e00><u+8a66><u+4e0d><u+904e><u+8a18><u+5f97><u+8a02><u+4f4d><u+554a><u+3002>, the beijing duck was well presented and tested great along with all other dishes we ordered the wait in line was tedious but had stools available that made it bearable it does allow for some time to observe locals and their ways there is an unfortunate part to most traditional restaurants around wangfujing the cleanliness is rather poor and they pay little attention to details not a bad choice but a big contrast to unsurpassed chinese luxury restaurants found in the top class hotels, ��� �� ��� ����������� ���� � ���� ���� ����������

thank you, the duck and other dishes were exceptionally delicious but the over 1 hour wait to be seated as they do not take bookings and watching as some customers were treated preferentially and jumped the queue made the experience not so enjoyable
arrive early and not ravenous and you will be fine
two suggestions for the restaurant would be to a serve drinks to waiting patrons beer wine etc they would make more money and have placated us a bit b have some form of written english explaining the process as no one spoke english, es empfiehlt sich hier entweder vor dem gro<u+00df>en essensansturm schon um 17173o zu erscheinen oder zu den letzten gasten zu zahlen zur hauptabendessenszeit bildet sich eine lange schlange wartender
die ente ist einfach klasse in der pflaumensauce zudem werden ganz dunne teigrollen geliefert die dann wie ein wrap mit der ente gegessen werden am tisch wird die fachgerechte zubereitung erlautert aber auch andere speisen wie die dumplings sind hervorragend, we enjoyed this restaurant were 1st time peking duck waters  were unsure of what to do the staff helped not many spoke english but they were so helpful  sweet we so enjoyed it had 2 ducks  many sides 6 personnel trays we had many sides of winter  autumn menu which were good but small portions i think the regular menu sides were larger portions of what we saw overall great experience would go back again gets very crowded with locals  so go early dinner only cost about 100$ for six plus bottle wine, �������� ��������� ���� ���� ���������� ����������� ��������� ���� ������� ���������� �������� ������ �������� ���������� ����� � ���� �������, finally decided to go there consider very lucky as not need to cue seated in front of the roasted oven where i can see the live how the chef roasting the duck the service was thoughtful as they prepared a porridge for my son and small local fruit with smoked dry ice for the table finally the highlight of the dinner served  peking duck also order some other food portion was good  good for family visit, valbesokt restaurant inte sa langt ifran the forbidden city

kan dock bli mycket folk och ko, we visited siji minfu on the 17th december luckily we got there early at five thirty so there was no need to queue we ordered peking roast duck which lived up to its standard crispy melt in your mouth skin tender meat and light fluffy pancakes we ordered some other cheaper vegetable and meat dishes not their house specialty but tasty and not too oily nor salty this can be a problem with northern chinese cooking all up dinner for sixteen people was less than 1400 rmb quite good value really i would definitely recommend the place, peking duck was acceptable less crispy than da dongs but crispier than quan ju de highlights were the huang tan xiang soup cabbage with chestnut stirfry sprouts etc pricing was acceptable, anatra arrosto alla pechinese squisita e preparata al momento da uno chef vicino al nostro tavolo agnello arrosto buonissimo prezzi modici unico neo si attende in coda per un oretta soprattutto se andate tra le 1800 e le 2100 locale frequentato da pechinesi pochissimi turisti occidentali il che e gia un ottimo punto di partenza
consigliato, we really enjoyed this dinning experience and enjoyed the peeking duck this restaurant live up to the reviews and i would recommend we were advised to arrive before 7pm to get a table which we did the place gets very busy and the queue was out of the door when we left
the waiter and waitresses dont speak english as mentioned in the previous reviews and so this make it a little more tricky when i comes to ordering however the menus have pictures but are sadly missing a description so you will have to take a gamble when ordering we still really enjoyed the food we got regardless and were pleasantly surprised at what good value it was when we received our bill the restaurant also takes credit card, unanatra pazzesca che ti cucinano davanti una volta preparata puoi condire come preferisci i gustosi roll che servono unitamente allanatra prezzi ottimi e locale molto carino consigliatissimo, ok its best to come with a crowd because it is family style serving not much english spoken but you can point to most things on the menu or at other tables and for goodness sake you are in beijing duck is awesome view is awesome i had the honey shrimp which were great we did not have a wait but sometimes there is but there are places to sit ive been here twice and not disappointed no western bathroomsfyi, upon arrival at our hotel we decided to head out to dinner and we had marked this restaurant as a candidate we asked the hotels lobby if we needed a reservation but the response was negative
since it appeared to be about 1012 mins walk from our hotel we decided to walk and we did it seems to be a safe area
the restaurant is easy to spot since there is a sign in english
we had to wait a few mins and we were sitted some staff speak enough english to get understood language was not sn issue the menu had the best food photos i have ever seen and it included the plate names in english
we had the duck off course and we enjoyed it alongside a few other dishes as well all of which were very tasty
we were also offered as a treat a roast duck soup  very tasty as well, we waited about 90 min for table but we end up with a private room for 5 people i read about this restaurant online before we arrives in beijing we were chatting with a family from england and their hotel staff recommended this restaurant

we ordered the whole duck an appetizer which is amazing a noodle tofu and shrimps very tasty as well the duck was amazing in my opinion

if you have not try peking duck and dont mind the wait you should try it there is another famous chained peking duck restaurant but one of my friend who were dining with us stated the portion from that restaurant is really small, really nice food i read the review before we went and they were mostly spot on no english speaking staff and not overly friendly but the food was great you should check it out, we went there as three people to taste beijing duck and we werent disappointed the wait was a bit long but it was totally worth it quite expensive for a chinese restaurant though, we found the food to be quite boring and lacking flavour the service was average as well they didnt refill waters or ask if we wanted another beer the rice came after we had pretty much finished our meat dishes also they dont take any credit card payments cash only which was surprising for a nice  modern looking restaurant we also ended up walking back to our hotel the cab situation in beijing is pretty atrocious none of them speak a word of english  refuse short trips anyway the only reason i mention that in this review is because one of the hostesses tried very hard to find us a cab with no luck she spent a good 20min trying to help us get a ride back
to our hotel so i did want to mention how kind she was overall i would not recommend this restaurant, while in beijing the musteat dishes are peking duck or a steamboat in this wintry weather we chose the peking duck we waited for an hour for the duck so while waiting we had the veal sour deep fried pork and green vege be prepared to pay about rmb350 for half duck a meat dish and a veg dish and a chinese stew","Indian cuisine",0.675611511177062
100,"we were staying at the novotel just down the street so my fiance and i stopped in at drunk after dinner one night we were sitting in the quiet casual coffee shopstyle area downstairs until we heard a band warming up so we moved upstairs its a big bar area upstairs with brewing equipment behind the bar multiple dining areas
��, went here over cny and the service was great highly recommend the wings cheap enough and nice kid friendly atmosphere, found this bar when returning to our hotel one evening and thought we would give it a shot we liked the 80s music they had on downstairs the staff were friendly and helpful large variety of western style food available we had a pizza which we were impressed with cocktails were nice also has a great vibe only reason why
��, the restaurant looks like an average coffee shop when you first walk in but be sure to go upstairs for the good food and the good beer we enjoyed our meal and the service was excellent great vibe we were surprised to hear some 70s  80s music from the live duo for craft beer connoisseurs try the 5x tester
��, we happened upon this bar walking back to hotel we were pleasantly surprised that the band playing was a great rock singer who sings american music great music and drinks i highly recommend this bar, good place to find western food when youre craving it in beijing pizza was decent and theres a good selection of beer it was nice to see franziskaner wei<u+00df>bier available ordering on the ipad is a bit weird with a group as only one person can be looking at the menu at a time we took some slices of cake
��, we went here twice while in beijing nice place to unwind and have a drink good service good food, definitely caters to the western crowd but a lot of locals there too great location downtown live music on the second floor lots of western dishes all food was served quickly and warm crafted beers are great but pricey if you are looking for filling meal would definitely recommend it, good coffee even if the price is above reasonable 4 eu for a double expresso if you want a fast lunch this is the place as the dishes are cheap and good quality and have that western taste that most bars and restaurants in beijing strugle with you also get a complimentary tomato and egg soup with each meal choice
��, we were staying at a nearby hotel and fellow guests said try the drunk we had dinner there one night but were slightly disappointed with our pizzas the bases were a tadge underdone and the toppings a bit tasteless great atmosphere though with live music reasonably priced, stopped for a quick late night snack the beer was pretty good but the roast chicken was just ok the side dishes mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold, excellent food and awesome service staff spoke average english but were very courteous and delivered well presented food clean and tidy, we stayed nearby at the red wall garden hotel the drunk is located very nearby the metro stop which is wonderful for all those in that area they give a 10 discount if you show local hotel room keycan save you a few $$so take advantage if you can pub style decor with a very young wait stafflocated on 3
��, craft beer ordered from an ipad house band covering 1970s rock tunes and an aesthetic that is both hip and comfortable prices are a little high but that is beijing, when you just cant bear anymore rice and chinese food come here for pizza does the trick margarita pizza was a hit but they are all fine, fica em uma esquina e e muito simpatico fica aberto ate altas horas e serve comida ocidental como pizza e
��, well this place is ideal for chilling out the staff bring the menu on an ipad for you to order has great craft beer coffee and food some live music upstairs private rooms and free wifi, a group of us from ireland were staying in an adjacent hotel we decided to visit the drunk and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience beer wine coffee snacks meals modern and funky with friendly and attentive staff well worth a visit, this is the type of place western people crave after being in a chinese place for quite some time and need a good food fix and good craft beers in the usual familiar environment so though it might not be what you should be doing in beijing it is a great place to visit prices are of course higher than
��, nice modern place ordering via tablet friendly staff extensive menu many beers on draft we were here for dinner had a beer excellent french fries excellent german sausage and tasty salami pizza excellent mango icecream disappointing icecream with rum and raisins western prices so not cheap, this was a welcome change from staple chinese restaurants it was modern and funky and the staff were friendly and helpful, less than average very expensive food of low quality good corner location and it accepts international credit cards other than that please avoid, we called into the drunk cafe for a quick stop on our way to the airport you place your order on an ipad mini and the waitresses bring your orders to your table very quickly we only wanted a light snack and some drinks but we were very happy with the service and quality of the food everything was fresh
��, had our lunch here its good we ordered spaghetti and salad they have some very good cakes as well the name seems a bit misleading youll think its a bar restaurant its not perhaps at night but it has good ambiance as its in the corner of the street you can just sit there and sip coffee while people watching
��, stopped here for a great coffee and a good cake all good and modern service by i pads which is a bit different but makes it easy to communicate  cant fault the quality they also have a beer place upstairs where you can have european dinner with good music , personale molto cortese che sa capire e parlare inglese si puo pagare con la carta di credito e non solo
��, sem refinamento mas com boas intencoes grande escolha de bebidas e pizzas bem razoaveis para beijing, drunk does a roaring trade in serving western food to western people who are tired of the hotel fare served up in the large number of luxury hotels hereabouts drunk feels fresh and welcoming and offers a beery reprieve from the more familiar tsingtao and yanjing theyve come up with a neat solution to the language problem by letting you
��, we found this place on a roasting afternoon while walking the streets of beijingit was a cross between brewdog and costa coffe with a good selection of food for all i had a pint of ipa whilst my wife was on the passion fruit cider both extremely refreshing the afternoon we visited none of the staff spoke english but as
��, a disappointing visit this morning for a coffee i has a few minutes to kill  decided to stop in for a latte 20 minutes later i received my lukewarm latte the restaurant was not busy i have no idea for the delay nice atmosphere and relatively friendly staff but very slow, great service however the coffee is never ever hot  ask for more hot but it still comes warm however the staff are very friendly and speak some english, the stronger draft beer in the area waiters speak ok english good coffee clean and nice to be at street level for people watching, we went there for 34 nights as we were hosted at a near hotel we tasted different dishes and all were very good pizza burguers sandwiches pasta good atmosphere and chill anbient sometimes live music service very kind and fast you can also play some dards and have some fun finally they made their own beer recommended , chegamos tarde e com fome e apesar de nao falar ingles a garconete nos explicou que nem todos os pratos

��, we ate here after a very long day of sight seeing struggled to find anything western apart from pizza hut and of course mc donalds but with two british teens in tow not keen on the chinese restaurants this place was ideal great service food and nice wine and some craft beers steaks were expensive but pasta and chicken reasonable
��, enjoyed a couple of visits to drunk for some nice cold beer whilst in beijing as it was hot good selection of beers and drinks as well as foodl, food was great craft beer sucked i tried the five beer sample platter thing and they were all subpar we got bottled tsing tao the entire time cause it was cheapest i really enjoyed the veggie pizza and the mixed drinks are pretty good too we ended up going here a total of three times one time was at around
��, great little bar with lots fo beer on tap and cocktails watch out for the long island iced tea live music most nights, stopped in for a beer and snack the beer name i ordered was fantastic fruity and delicious craft beer would recommend for a beer and snack didnt try main meals, the venue is clean and modern on a street corner near the wangfujing shopping district we didnt eat here but only sampled their craft beer it was excellent and for an extremely good price id recommend this to real ale affocianados, my pizza crust was dry and difficult to cut through although two couples ordered via ipad separately the waiter insisted on merging our two bills and refused to separate them the string music on the second floor stage was very nice, we were looking for a place to have lunch and gave this place a try the service staff were very attentive and helpful i ordered the black pepper beef with rice which i enjoyed ordering was easy using the ipad provided the atmosphere was relaxed and they provided free wifi connection too we enjoyed the service and went back another

��, as always excellent service fresh food and wonderful service the wine list is carefully selective but affordable the best friendly atmosphere and presentation available for business and family occasions in beijing imo, its one of the best places in beijing to enjoy peking duck without too much noise and can pair with a nice bottle of wine the food is not cheap but i think is of great value exceptionally good if there are foreign guests, i was here together with a colleague on a monday evening it was fairly full and we were probably lucky to get a table the venue is in a small break in one of the high streets in beijing it is a very beautiful building in a much more traditional style than the rest of the street very attentive staff

��, i walked in the area and looked for a coffee and a snack the ramo is the right place for this like it, great prices and very reasonable the food was good had the hummus flat bread they have a western toilet with a disco ball which is huge for this hutong area wasnt impressed by the brownie but everything else was grand, came here by chance attracted by the look and vibe of the place great drinks pimms mojito amazing fries with feta  not to mention the surprisingly great pizza  our first in two weeks of china we werent seeking western food but when it is of this quality in such a friendly place with such good vibes why pass
��, we ordered a winter salad and the parma ham pizza both of which were really delicious and some of the best western food weve had during our 4 months traveling in asia location was good on a quiet hutong staff was friendly prices were reasonable well probably dine here again before leaving beijing, local ideal para ir apos visitar o lama temple e confucios temple tem ar condicionado banheiro ocidental e atendimento amistoso

��, used to live a stone throw from fangjia hutong where ramo is located but now unfortunately live much further away so cannot come as much as i like to however each time i been there its been nothing but great ambience is always very nice and drinks and foods are both tasty and affordable it can get very busy however
��, had a pizza and a salad and both were great the place like most cool places in beijing is hiding in a very old and dirty ally but inside you find a modern restaurant with a mix of diner and coffe shop like decor ramos salad and pizza was a great change after a few weeks of chinese food, went there with my boyfriend very nice hutongs experience you can sit outside and watch the real hutong life  food is ok nothing special prices are cheap nothing special, we ending up eating here 45 times during our stay in beijing since we stayed at a hotel nearby the pizza was really great just one negative thing the first time we ate there one of the staff was standing in the doorway into the kitchen cutting her fingernails sooo disgusting but at least there werent any nail clippings on
��, i love this place and the food is great wide selection of drinks too very popular with expats so dont go if you want to avoid them though youre going for the food right you need a pizza that tastes like pizza, ramo is a nice spot in fangjia hutong near the lama temple it offers a range of salads and pizzas
��, our offices is in this hu tong and we stop by pretty much 2 to 3 times a week lunch dinners drinks we come so often that we actually noticed all the menu changes and things have only gotten better cool to see that this place is doing better all word of mouth business and now the place is getting
��, this is a pretty decent pizza place on fangjia hutong the venue itself is nice chic and airy the food is good and very reasonably priced and the drinks are on the lower end of the price scale as well probably the best option in this neck of the woods for a cheaper western meal, been living in beijing from 20072012 recently came back for a good friends wedding was walking around my old neighborhood

��, this is a really great italian restaurant there are several branches in areas of beijing where foreigners live and work this branch is very close to a lot of hotels but it is the hardest to find one morning i walked around the guomao area with this app showing the chinese translation to taxi drivers delivery people hotel concierges natives
��, it was a dark and stormy night it was also a stormy day spent touring around in the rain no one wanted to go out again once we got back to the hotel the kids were being adventurous eaters all trip but wanted a little comfort food as well concierge recommended this place to deliver pizza was great fast and
��, annies always try to keep the quality and portion size no matters inflation or even war this restaurant is nice after business meetings in guomao area cheap pretty and good thanks annies all dishes are recommended, for awhile as we were adjusting to life in beijing we would order annies once a week it was affordable good and consistent so often in beijing you can enjoy a dish and go back and it doesnt taste the same but annies is consistently good worth a try, we were in china for two weeks and craving western food annies didnt disappoint us we had pizza spaghetti and ravioli, living in china for foreigner i think is not so easy speaking about the food if you miss western food
��, this pizza was great it was definitely a shock for me to think that the pizza would be any good in china but it was probably the best pesto pizza ever definitely get the pesto pizza it was amazing we loved it so much we ate here 3 times, as a vegetarian looking for decent restaurant in beijing cbd stumbled upon annies loved the place instantly very american cafe feel lively music great service very friendly staff food was delicious brilliant veggie pastas and pizzas very very affordable i give it a 5 star  highly recommend for anyone looking for italianvegetarian food they have chain across the city

��, ive eaten here three times over three years and the last time was july 2014 pizza pasta dessert and wine were all very good even compared to american restaurants even with a bottle of wine the entire meal was a great price i was actually shocked it didnt cost more the restaurant was clean inside and well decorated the staff
��, enjoyed eating italian food and they even delivered to our hotel room across the street to our ascot hotel good pizza pasta and salads too prices were very reasonable too we ended up eating different food from this restaurant 3 nights in a row as we did not feel like going out, we were staying at the ascott across the street and was pleasantly surprise to find this gem just a stones throw away the staff was super friendly and courteous not to mention the food quality was excellent, perfect place for satisfying italian craving while being in beijing we really appreciated the delivery service during cold weather we love annies, i stayed at ascott across the road with my family while my kids eat asian food when they craved a western fix and after a days touring with chinese food annies hit the mark out of 4 nights we ate there 3 dinners mostly due to convenience but the food was reasonable the service was good i travel a lot
��, i love the pumpkin soup here the pizza is kind of fatty though its more american than italian the price is the same as many other pizza places in beijing this place is a more family oriented delivery pizza place summary bring your family here delivery till 1030 pm starting from 1030 am, my husband and i went to the annies lido branchtwice in fact the food was great fresh authentic tasty and well priced the service was refreshingly good  we live in qingdao often the service is sooooon bad in restaurants it puts me off going out if you are near an annies and fancy some good quality solid western cooking
��, ok may be not everything is better for example there is no truffle no kobe steak no lobster or even foie gras on top of pizzas but the cooking is solid with authentic italian flavour the service cordial and the decor comfortable i was pleasantly surprised that one can find such good italian food in a chain restaurant in china
��, my son and i were desperate for some nonchinese food and a colleague took us to this little gem excellent food chill atmosphere, eaten at annies 4 times within one week as we stayed at a nearby hotel the menu is very diverse from classic italian pastas and risottos great soups salads seafood and steak plus the kids get to make their own mini pizzas as complimentary starters staff speaks english well and is very helpful a great place for dinner, reasonably authentic italian food with some chinese characteristics pizza and pasta pizzas probably better long way from the centre so only works if you are in the area toilets were a bit rough, when you feel you had too much chinies food go to annies  great italian food  english speaking personal  very friendly to children  great service  do delivery and ta  excellent ","Indian cuisine",0.999059109975102

��, travelling in china while vegetariankosher or really with any special dietary restriction can make meals a challenge and can occupy significant portions of your energy just looking for a suitable place to solve your hunger this is obviously exacerbated by not speaking chinese so it comes at no surprise that so many others like ourselves found this chain of vegan

��, the restaurant looked homely but stylish they had a lot of choice on the menu from tofu dishes to imitation fish and meat we had a hard time choosing between these  the food we eventually ordered was really good and it wasnt too expensive we paid 76 rmb each we were with 3 for a lot of food, it was so good i ate a lot and spent a lot ordered two things for 91cny i was alone and underestimated how much food was in those two orders i communicated with the waiter with gestures the staff were very pleasant i ate sweet and sour fake pork and some crispy things that you put in a wrap which

��, who could know you would get such great america bbq in beijing the brisket is to die for the grits like homemade the ribs falling apart and the beverage just the way you like it what not to like, as a memphis native and current texas resident my bbq bar is set pretty high home plate did not disappoint we had the 4 meat platter to share so we could try all the major offerings and i must say it was all pretty good i liked the pulled pork and sausage the best my fiancee liked the rib tips
��, i had lunch here 3 times over the course of a month as it was close to where i worked the bbq was pretty good as were the french fries a little pricey for beijing but about standard for good quality western food very hard to find i read about it on time out but would never have happened upon

��, this place can be a little difficult to find even though the address puts it on xiaoyun road its actually located off the main street in a back alley so if you have never been expect a bit of an adventure searching for it the menu is a the assortment of american bbq fare which is unusual for being so

��, i frequented this restaurant a ton when i lived in beijing its home style cooking will transport you out of beijing in the deep south the pulled pork was my favourite but the friend pickles always went down as a big hit the alley way location was one of my favourite spots in the city to sit around the street
��, not on xiaoyun lu but in a courtyard that runs parallel to the main drag worth finding though i like a good chilli bowl and their cup is generous with good chunks of beer slow boat on tap great music as well, one of our beijing favorites home plate fills the need for texas bbq we love everything weve had including brisket pulled pork burgers fried pickles corn dogs and nachos wish there were a few totally notspicy sauces but still all around great grub brush up on your chinese as the few englishspeaking employees that used to be there seem to

��, amazing food beat burgers in beijing for sure great home made beer friendly staff in the evening there is also nice live music must go, this original location is a bit hard to find if your new to beijing but worth seeking out they also opened up a much larger venue in sanlitun which is definitely worth a visit where they also occasionally host live bands and comedians a sliced brisket or pulled pork sandwich puts you back only 35 rmb and have a great
��, theres a great atmosphere at the home plate bar and bque and its well worth finding out for yourself you will find this place at the rear of the comfort inn just past san li tun bar street being a brit im not turned a lot by bbq food but the home plate is the exception the food is excellent
��, yeah sanyuanqiao location is kind of hard to find but when you finally get there you will realize youve done the right thing great ribs and ribs tips excellent pulled pork and amazingly tasty burgers also a good selection of beer and spirits my wife enjoyed it so much she is even asking me to go there again dont know

11,"would definitely recommend trying out this restaurant  i had the speciality  beijing duck which was lovely in fact their menu is really extensive and it all looks delicious i definitely could spend hours sampling the menu a really good place to go with friends or your partner for a lovely civilised evening

would definitely go back the next time i visit

the staff are really attentive and speak english so it made it easier to order and ask questions they help explain what everything is and provide an excellent service thank you  look forward to the next time, the dadong group of beijing restaurants have been famous for the best peking duck in beijing for decades now and that reputation in my view is welldeserved delicious succulent and consistent is the caliber of food i have had in the many times i have eaten here over the last six years, i went there once and that is enough the place is highly commercial and is like a roast duck factory and the services like an assembly line it lacks character and taste essential for fine dining experience you just go there for a good duck for a price you can afford and gets no more than what you bargain for i have tried plenty of places that can do better in beijing, recommended by the jw concierge this place did not fail to meet our high expectations for not only a delicious peking duck dinner but also a fantastic presentation with perfect condiments  mouth watering right now just thinking about it, was working in china over the summer family came visit we decided to try this restaurant because it was recommended for its duck anyway when we looked through the menu we were quite alarmed and unnerved because of how fusiony and unconventional it all looked

good chinese food doesnt normally mix well with new school

anyway when food did arrive all of it was very well done whether new or old style dishes the duck was very well done not phenomenal but good we booked our own private room so service was good, the best roast duck i ever had and on top paired with a great atmosphere and good service
beautiful place with real open fire where the ducks get roasted  must se and must taste, its impossible to visit beijing and not try the peking duck and this restaurant delivers a perfect duck
the sides are delicious too just dont listen to the waiter telling you that tou dont have enough food we did and we ended up with a lot of food untouched, the roast duck is beijings signature dish we were recommend come to dadong roast duck restaurant the duck is carved out in front of the table you can take the skeleton home or ask the restaurant to use it to cook some soup for you price wise its more then affordable about 50usd for a full duck with all the sides, we went dadong restaurant at night because we heard the duck was a must have i have to agree it is great peking duck very crispy but not dry and full of flavour we also ordered some other food
nice place to come, chef dong has created a very creative way to serve peking roasted duck the restaurant serves both traditional duck and lowfat duck in a very beautiful and cheerful setting the menu is very extensive with picture to match the meals rhe service is excellent with the waiters carving out the duck and serving the pancakes and accouterments in a very friendly and helpful way highly recommended for both the duck and the extensive menu luch is a better option, we went dadong on the night i have to agree it is great peking duck very crispy but not dry and full of flavour the restaurant is a modern fine dining experience  the service very good, if you are in beijing you should try the beijing duck da dong restaurants present it in a very nice way by your table also will give a hand how to eat it to get the most out of the taste, dadong is the restaurant chain most visitors will end up when trying peking duck the quality is good some staff speak english the menu is in english and has pictures it is a little pricey but ok for one in a lifetime peking duck experience, amazing best peking duck ever in my life skin crispy outside soft inside it melts in the mouth the brown souce delicious simply perfect, wow the presentation of my 1st time of having perking duck
the 24 hour preparation of this incredible meal was amazing i would highly recommend dadong for perking duck
with your meal you will have all the sides to put together the pancake with the duck
also served is duck soup black sesame soup a bowl of sweet tiny tangerines and to end it with a cotton candy with a fruit surprise in the middle yummy, you must have the duck exquisite and delicious the staff even demonstrated for us how to assemble the duck in the pancakes it was one of those rare meals that i will never forget, we dined at dadong roast duck in december 2016 let me first state that i am not a huge fan of duck but it was my significant others birthday and i booked it because i knew he would love it i ordered a chicken dish and it was spectacular he ordered the vip roast duck the duck was carved at the table and the process was almost mesmerizing the chef used great precision in carving the duck and carefully arranged it on plates there was also a plate of side which could be used with a won ton wrapper to roll the duck with various vegetables since the chef prepared 2 plates i felt obligated to try it omg those were the first words out of my mouth the skin on the duck was to die for it literally melted in your mouth and had a sweet flavor i successfully polished off half of the duck and i am not a duck fan remember and wished i had more it was the offseason when we visited and the restaurant was still very busy and a reservation was required the service was also worth noting our waiter did not speak english and we did not speak chinese he was very helpful in showing us what to do with the items on the side dish platter i also feel that the meal was cheap i know that many people stated that they felt it was very expensive we had the vip duck a chicken dish and multiple beers for a mere $59usd we live in the florida keys and would have paid over $250 for such a dish overall great food great service great value, while in beijing we have indulged in our great fondness of roast duck in my opinion the flagship of local cuisine 7 ducks in as many days a near addiction
the comparison between several recommended duck places is extremely interesting and instructive
roast duck at dadong is definitely good surely expensive but by no means the best around the restaurant prides itself in mixing up chinese tradition and french influence and that could well be the problem m dong the famous chef and owner is pictured with the likes of ducasse and robuchon and prides himself with serving a leaner duck with less fat under the skin true and also true the bird is crispy and flavorous but when looking for a chinese roast duck i want to find a chinese duck not a french one dadong is not la tour dargent besides the fraction of the bird that you finally get is a bit minimal for the high price you pay out of the seven we tried dadong stands low in the ranking rest of the food is excellent and pricey to me a drawback is a certain lack of local atmosphere decor is cold and the place lacks the conviviality of some comparable chinese counterparts
is dadong a good restaurant certainly is it worth its reputation very debatable is it the best place for roast duck in town definitely not, was at dadong on 25th december 2016 for christmas dinner it was not only a wonderful culinary experience but a visually appealing experience as well

its pricey but the quality of the food was well worth it the entire experience was worth the price paid, if you are going to beijing you will hear many people tell you that you must try peking duck dadong is one of the premier places to get peking duck and they do a very good job the duck is brought out to you and handcarved at your table the waiter will also show you how to eat it the traditional way if you ask wrapped up in a little pancake with seasonings this was far and away the most expensive meal that we had in beijing but the experience was worth it the restaurant was clean the service was prompt and the food good we got a whole duck a side of eggplant and two glasses of wine for $80 usd compared to street food the prices are outrageous but the duck is truly delicious the waiters dont speak that much english but the menus all have pictures so it shouldnt be a problem
i also highly recommend the eggplant sauteed with garlic it was incredible, we had a long wait as we hadnt booked a table but there was plenty of people watching to be done as this is a popular crowded restaurant we eventually moved up the queue as we agreed to sit at a large communal table which is not our usual style but let us see what locals were ordering and we met some interesting people the duck was lean and crispy and amongst the best we have tasted in beijing although similar is available cheaper and in a less frantic environment we enjoyed it but wouldnt rush back, unfortunately no picture of the duck but the skin was perfectly suckling juicy and crispy

the great
duck was the highlight and they give everyone individual dipping sauce plate see photo

they gave us a frozen hawthorne dessert that is slightly sweet and sour which is super refreshing i wish they gave it earlier to cleanse the palate after eating the duck

 very classy oriental decor

the okay stuff
 portion is fairly small and expensive each dish comes sml sizes the clear glass noodles see pic we ordered was around 150 rmb for a small plate which is crazy converting back to cad

the bad
 it seems common to put out dessert as an appetizer not at the very end it was confusing when to start eating it they were all nice snacks but nothing special

 the menu see photo is a big book it was quite intimidating no one helps you on ordering and so we took a picture of every item when we decided

 service exists for visible foreigners if you look asian service is kind of hit and miss at times you dont have a set server for your table its whoever u catch they never come around to check on food tasterefill water if they do its a rough pour im always amazed how the hot tea never splatters given how they look so nonchalant about it they also dont smile

a family friend has been here three times and she loves it saying the chain has put very innovative items on the menu that you dont see elsewhere i agree on the innovation disagree on the value to taste

overall im glad i tried the new blockbuster duck in beijing but i wouldnt go back the whole high class experience between food taste quality and dining experience is mismatched, the roast duck and trimmings are all delicious and it is quite the show to see it patiently carved in front of you the place is easy to find close to metro station, great execution of a beijing classic dish as well as a visually impressive though rather noisy atmosphere the duck is moist with a crispy skin  just right for an excellent meal we also enjoyed a wellprepared squirrel fish that was sweet and crispy, the duck here is of course delicious i love all of the condiments used to make the little duck wraps into a sort of chinese taco the chef carving table side is a nice touch as well the price is very reasonable compared to a similar meal in the states

avoid the duck feet unless you really love ginger and i mean really just love the taste of ginger, this restaurant was amazing desserts were over the top i was a pastry chef who had worked for 4 james beard award winning chefs and i have to say this place knows what they are doing food and atmosphere were great it may have helped that we were there with someone from beijing who spoke chinese the foie gras cherries are not to be missed wagyu steak with sea salt and lime melted in your mouth chocolate truffle dessert little chocolate ducks filled with truffle with real truffles is also a must lobster and red bean pasta was delicious and of course the peking duck was the best also try the white chocolate shells for a fun dessert, simply best duck in town i loved the atmosphere and the overall good experience

it is not a michelin star experience but very good quality and relatively good prices, was there with a colleague and we ordered the usual roast duck dumplings and more roast duck was ok condiments cost rmb12 per person and the dumplings was not as good as i expected it to be with the price ambience is beautiful and the many horses inside will keep the photo lovers very happy the drinks at the bar while waiting for your table is also comprehensive and i might add that they do have a better bar selection then most places i have been as well overall a great place for romance if it is in the air, we were told by a friend to have dinner at dadong restaurant and were very happy with the food served there the staff were very friendly and the service was excellent the roast duck was absolutely delicious, this restaurant looks very fancy so we thought our bill for 4 was going to be an arm and a leg but it was only $170 we ordered a lot of food 2 mixed drinks a sofa flat and sparkling water duck dim sum dumplings snacks salad soup some other dishes and we did not finish most of it i think you could probably feed 4 people for about $120 pretty reasonable for such a nice looking fancy place , group of six pre cruise venture to dadong for apeking duck very difficult when you no know the lingo and get one of the most complicated menu books ever so big and so much we just wanted these special ducks with pancakes and trims and of course a beer we only ordered two we thinks that what they recommended big mistake this fabulous duck just disappeared we needed four no doubt but too late the place was packed and a good noisy atmosphere just a shame no one knew chinese, delicious peking duckcomes with pancakes soup and after dinner fruit so be prepared not much english so a bit difficult to understand how duck dish works highly recommend having the duck menu warrants a good readeven if it is just to read through the beautifully photographed dishes are almost to pretty to eat presentation here takes top marks, peking duck is a must have here and you get the complete experience with the chef in full white chefs garb including hat at the table with his super sharp duck slicing knife a great show and the resulting duck and pancakes is perfectly pleasant but not the shredded duck you might be used to from the west which i must say i prefer other dishes also beautifully presented and service was very attentive all felt a little soulless to me though despite the high quality of food and service, terrible service we were ushered in by a disinterested waitress our table wasnt laid out this was one of the top things we were looking forward to in beijing we were given the menus we were deciding what to order for drink appetizers and of course the duck the waitress comes to us and asked us what duck do you want we figured duck would take time to roast so we were being asked to order that before hand we ordered the duck and were looking through the menu to order appetizers and drinks voila 5 mins later i noticed a movement behind me and the guy had started carving our roasted duck we were at first confused since our drink orders were not taken and no one asked if we wanted to order anything else we told the waitress that she hadnt taken our complete order her response was you wanted duck right at that point we were too pissed to order anything else we ate what was in front of us paid for it and left i wont comment on the food because it does not matter after being treated like this we are tourists and new to china we have eaten at a lot of local places during our visit this is the first time i have seen such a terrible service in fact this takes the top spot of being the worst restaurant experiences ever congrats da dong, without doubt the roast duck at dadongs restaurant is world class the duck is perfectly cooked and sliced and the crispy skin is so spectacular that my mouth is watering while i am writing this review the restaurant and service are terrific but the undisputed highlight is the duck i read that a dadongs will be opening in new york city get ready new york this is as good as it gets, dadong is a modern and upscale restaurant menu is literally massive but the restaurant is known for peking duck the duck here is very good with extra crispy skin restaurant is good for small or large parties, this place is simply outstanding worth of a michelin star in my humble opinion had the sea cucumber several kung pao dishes and of course the duck, after a day walking  the great wall i asked if our guide could recommend us a good place for peking duck he advised us dadong and made a reservation for us

the restaurant has a fancy and expensive look we ordered the duck menu we ordered one whole duck which costed around 289 yuan

together with a massive 500ml hoegaarden beer and side dishes it costed us in total 392 yuan and best part we got soup desert and fruit included

nice thing about the service was that  our table they cut the duck and showed us how to properly prepare your duck for eating

after dinner they were kindly to explain us how to find our way back to the hotel

i had a good time and if you are in beijing check dadong out, thought the tastes were super mehhhhh the ambiance is what youre paying for i actually enjoyed the peking duck but didnt think it was all that great maybe i thought i was going to be wowd but i thought it was average, near the city centre is this place dadong where you can eat the famous peking duck in the traditional way reservation is only possible at 1800 the rest of the evening is first come
they show you the duck before analyzing and preparing it the taste is delicious eat it with garlic sugar or a kind of chocolate sauce with pancakes bread or with vegetables i think we had an excellent meal for a decent price 400 yuan for two persons inclusing 4 chinese white beers service was a little shy nevertheless excellent food nice evening, had food here good service it was situated near the silk market so a good place to have a coffee or food, this is the very first time i eat duck chinese style and i have to say its fab  highly recommend if ones in china then try the duck, you cannot go wrong with da dong taste and service are all well planned and well thought of and executed professionally, i was taken to this restaurant by my chinese host because he claimed it served the best peking duck in beijing we ate in a private room the menu was amazing all the dishes were contained in a thick book with photos so you could easily understand what you were ordering

the service was excellent what i found intriguing was the very artistic style of the dishes some similarities to french cuisine in the imagination and way in which the dishes were presented there was one which was just like a christmas scene with small cubes of meat forming a small hill and fine grain sugar lightly dusted over it

the peking duck was superb

i have no idea of the costs but certainly the restaurant was packed when we arrived and left i guess that reservations are essential anytime we ate on a monday evening and the host said he had ordered the peking duck and made the reservation 2 days previously, we had a group of 10 on a business trip and dadong was the restaurant on our final night we came for the roast duck and were not disappointed it was excellent as advertised however every dish we ordered was fantastic we had the grouper black pepper beef shrimp mushrooms etc the service was attentive and we never had to ask for more beer our favorite place of the whole week, lovely bright and airy restaurant very busy evening at the time of our visit quite slow service at first lots of choices on the menu
but very expensive the duck was delicious carved at your table by the chef
we also ordered hotpot which was prepared at your table
nice friendly waitresses, we wanted a peking duck experience while in beijing and we got it at da dong note that there are several da dong roast duck restaurants not sure if its the chinese equivalent of a chain so pick the one that is closest to your hotel the only real downside to the one that we went to was the lights were very bright my wife called them interrogation lights inside the restaurant they could do with a dimmer switch to give it a little better atmosphere, knowing it is also busy  we booked our table before getting there  the duck is so delicious for me even as a beijinger i been to many duck restarant  this one is so good  of course th price is also 3 times higher than normal restarant , beautiful setting both inside and out  duck was perfectly prepared and carved tableside served with a pancake and other accompaniments  almost like a chinese fajita, our hosts took us to the restaurant and the first sight to hit us was the expanse and the crowd  almost every table was overflowing with people and food its not easy to get a booking and we know whyabsolutely heavenly fare more than the duck it was the style elan and flourish with which the dish was served carved sliced and diced in our presence and served beautifully truly an unforgettable experience","Japanese cuisine",0.795148650477754

��, very popular as they import the band and dancers from germany to give it a very good traditional feel service is a little slow but the entertainment makes up for it it is well worth a visit if you are in beijing, recently visited the restaurant again on a return trip to beijing since i enjoy german food it gave me an opportunity to try different cuisine after you have been constantly eating asian cuisine the restaurant was fairly lively that evening and i had a smoked pork chop dinner with potatoes and sauerkraut which was delicious and of course the helles

��, excellent food it was our first stop on our tour and was very impressive service was excellent and buffet as well as sit down, the amount of food offered at such a great quality is unbelievable the fruits the local fare the western optionsall amazing, there is a wide variety of types of food for breakfast including hot and cold dishes we found that you needed to ask for well done omelettes but that seemed true throughout china you could have eggs done to order too i enjoyed having small portions of many regional dishes as well as salad noodles and regular breakfast items enjoyed
��, the breakfast buffet is awesome at the kerrys kitchen the biggest problem was not where to start but where to stop as it has something for everyone great fresh fruits and juices excellent breads and caters to almost every style for breakfast you could ever want we also had a great lunch there too, my wife and i visited kerry kitchen for weekend brunch the classic dishes are highly recommended  good value the staff are friendly  professional and the venue is bright and spacious a good choice of dishes on the menu highly recommended, this restaurant is great if you like asian food and if you want to eat a lot its quite pricey $10800 for my husband and i to have dinner with no alcohol and unfortunately there wasnt a whole lot of choices of food that we wanted to eat we would not have chosen this restaurant if we had checked the
��, surprisingly found some good singaporean food in kerry hotel and the price is so reasonable even located in a 5 star hotel, big chinese hotels seem to love buffets which please tour groups and business people on an expense account i suppose but the night we tried this buffet was a slow night with maybe only about 15 other diners in a place which could accommodate 100 diners easily though the spread has everything from sushi to grill raw bar salad bar
��, we went on a slow night and a lot of the food seemed to be over cooked or dried out from sitting in heat lamps or steam tables it was quite average for the price due to this, a beautiful restaurant with a fabulous breakfasts buffet with all kinds of food available for everyone, we have visited kerrys kitchen for a quick dinner and it was one of the worst western meals we had in the last months first mistake we ordered from the menu and that was obviously not appreciated by the staff the bottle of wine we ordered only appeared after a reminder the ice cooler for the wine appeared in the
��, the kerry kitchen buffet is large and efficient has western and chinese food doesnt look a very big dining area but they always seem to find space for everyone not cheap by chinese standards but worth the price, they really want people to pony up for the buffet and we will tomorrow the food was cold bacon had to be sent back i ordered over medium eggs and got mediumhard scrambled eggs the staff was perfect except for not understanding the order, kerry kitchen team are service oriented they are demonstrating their best friendly service to all the guests trying hard to accommodate guests needs if kerry management can increase more quality service members i believe it will bring kerry kitchen advance to another level good luck the chefs are constantly to improve the food quality looking forward to enjoy more yummy
��, if you are in need of decent hotel food with a wide variety of items then this restaurant at the main lobby of the kerry hotel is a good place for a meal, typically on my business trips i will dine at the hotel a few times one the first visit i tried the buffet there is a large variety of food mainly from different parts of asia which i am very familiar with the cost of the buffet is expensive but is comparable to many other food choices in that vicinity 
��, over the chinese new year we stayed at the kerry hotel and had both dinner and breakfast at kerrys kitchen

��, huge variety of food that was well cooked and nicely presented all of the people in our party were well satisfied and this included some local chinese they also liked the foodas a vegan i was able to have a huge selection overall very happy with this choice of restaurants, great service  an incredible array of asian  western food choices we had several breakfast meals  a couple of dinner meals at kerrys kitchen and enjoyed each one as much as the first, i enjoyed the breakfast and dinner buffet at the kerry kitchen there was a large selection of foods including chinese indian and western the wait staff in the kerry kitchen restaurant had a soso understanding of english apparently ordering green tea for breakfast was not typical, i had dinner here last night it was amazingly bad i usually hate writing bad reviews when everyone is happy but it was so bad that i am now afraid of going back there for breakfast it was supposedly a turkish buffet there was not much food that you would call turkish and it was nowhere near that which you
��, here you have a choice of ordering off a menu or doing their buffet the choices are many and almost too hard to choose they serve just about anything one would want, the service crews are friendly and always trying their best to meet our needs there are a variety of food selections and lately the healthy food corner was set up where you can find gluten free breads the food quality also have been improved for breakfast, this is a very cool restaurant and the food was fantastic its located in the kerry hotel prices are very high but food is good i enjoyed the noodle bar and selection of meats also great for breakfast just be prepared to pay, only a spoiled person would not feel gratefulness for any display of food but to be fair the breakfast buffet at kk is very ordinary in terms of variety or quality the broth in the noodle soups is extremely bland the ingredients used for many dishes are not of the highest quality so it showsservice is polite but not the
��, this is a nicely designed restaurant very japanese in its rock and wood style the buffet variety is ok but
��, the kerry hotel itself has good reputation in both service and quality like every good hotel the breakfast buffet is offered to the guests here the choice is tremendous with good quality nevertheless one cannot expect too much from buffet style restaurant anyway the quality and the service here is relatively good, fabulous breakfast buffet with very fresh dishes amazed at the well prepared buffet some of the best fruit ever eaten multiple western and asian choices and the flavor was excellent are here four mornings and one night i was not disappointed, on our 3 night stay with viking we dined here for breakfast each morning what a choice international or chinese dishes cooked to order whilst you wait or an excellent hot buffet the same format applied in the evening plus there is an a la carte menu, very bright nice place i tried not to gain too much mainly focusing on vegetables and sea food but roastbeef and grill chicken smelled irresistible asian options malay food indian japanese european etc anything you wish quite busy for tuesday lunch time, visited here for sunday brunch nice variety of food from bacon  eggs to dim sum  pastries and fresh fruits nice freshly squeezed fruit juices however the price is on the high side better value for money eg in grand millennium lunch buffet, we were staying in the kerry and ate here twice it was really good i ordered asian food both times it was very good i would recommend if youre staying in the hotel","Yunnan cuisine",0.992827945202929
116,"we were looking for good chinese restaurant with good authentic food and service would highly recommend this restaurant great food and service at a very reasonable price in good part of town highly recommended, this is not a particularly fancy restaurant nor is it one of those huge multistory places its a comfortable human size restaurant with delicious food as its name states the specialty here is the roast duck and it is very good a roast duck should not be dry and those who have been to quanjude know what i mean here
��, we decided to dine here after the numerous positive reviews as well as the cheaper price compared to most peking duck restaurants location of the restaurant is in the cbd guomao on ground floor among the apartments a fusion of classical decor and modern lighting creates for a enjoyable ambience food was great the crispy roast duck was on our

��, this place is a bit hard to find but trust me the duck has been on par with 1949 and da dong in addition they had a set menu that had other tasty items for less than 200rmb pp cant beat that these days, this is located in the vantone center in the cbd i came here for dinner and had a filling and delicious meal the menu has pictures with english descriptions the dining area has a classical feel and feels like an old tea house yummy duck its crispy and juicy the owner is very friendly and speaks english he says normally

��, located close to the chaowei soho this place serves very good peking duck with a hint of the apple wood used for roasting the duck reasonably price for half a duck the fried pork belly with green peppers dish was very good and so too was the eggplant served in a claypot overall great place at reasonable prices, we loved the warm interior private tables not family style and amazing meals the duck of course was delectable  but other dishes were memorable especially the spicy dryfried green beans we ate with abandon and drank too and our bill for 3 adults did not exceed $50, far less expensive than the more touristy spots rated higher you will not be disappointed if you choose to go here instead the duck was lean with perfect crispy skin and prepared to order in the large woodburning oven of the open kitchen the beer is cold and the sides especially crispy shrimp beijingstyle noodles and garlic eggplant were reasonably
��, this is a place to visit if you want to enjoy china duck price is fare they even have menues in english wood decor and you can see when they roast the duck we would come back if visiting china again, so this place was awesome the interior is rustic with beautiful wooden tables and a full view open kitchen you
��, this place is a little out of the way its out on the 3rd ring from downtown beijing we went there on a friday night leaving from the houtong area and it took us a little over an hour in a taxi to get there the taxi fare was pretty cheap though it was just a lot of waiting in
��, great peking duck for about half the price of some of the more well heeled joints in beijing no pomp and ceremony just high quality duck in a casual atmosphere other dishes on the menu were great staff was very friendly english menu pretty easy to find  a 10 minute walk east of parkview green, if you want roast duck but you dont want to go to quan ju de or da dong and you also dont want to spend a million dollars then this is your place its good its got low chairs and a relaxed atmosphere and an english menu what more could you want, as we were in the city we wanted to try famous beijin duck we came to this place after checking it on ta and it was a excelent choose restaurant is easy to fingbig plus the duck was perfect, wanting a budget but high quality sample of peking duck i headed here and was not disappointed its situated at the vantone centre in the chaoyang district just at the intersection between jinghua north street and jintong east road look out for the 711 and youll see it i managed to get in without a reservation and enjoyed a half

��, went with a business group and enjoyed the experience food was well presented and tasty and the list contained some nice wines at good prices staff were attentive without being oppressive overall a good experience in a nice relaxed environment with open kitchen worth a visit, if you love pizza or like a nice fancy place for business lunches or dinners this is the place they do have a variety of food and during the week their lunch set meals are very worth the price english friendly as well, muy buen restaurante italiano cerca del hotel kempinsky muy buena la pasta y las pizzas atencion muy correcta, i organized large dinner with some fellow italian expats in beijing excellent reviews from all chef mauro portaluppi and manager frank hao have shown great professionalism and creativity in a very well balanced and fresh italian cuisine a bit pricy but worth the experience an interesting surprise is the pizza cooked in an authentic woodheated oven try the pizza christine
��, great italian dishes created by the chef in the open kitchen of the restaurant i got the business lunch menu including soup gnocchi apple tart and espresso the service is great and the managers know how to make you feel welcome cheers with the prosecco, tavola has been my favorite place to eat for years now one of the rare place in beijing where you can get authentic italian food approved by my italian collegues who are very picky trust me their chief comes from italy and has worked in michelin starred restaurant the products are fresh very good lunch set and great for dinner
��, there are two outstanding things here one is service you can witness it the moment you go across the door theyre magnificently well trained impeccable is the word service in beijing lacks the concept of courteousness observed in vietnam cambodia let alone developed countries their service is refreshingly pleasing the other thing to stand out is the price in my

��, tavola continues to be my favorite place to eat in beijing surprising as its northern italian cuisine but a refuge from the noise of the city good menu  im very partial to the flank steak and parmesan cheese over rocket greens with a balsamic dressing two comments in particular  for those who mentioned the prices this restaurant is
��, tenuto conto che siamo a 8000km da casa mi ritengo soddisfatto bel locale intimo luce piacevole ben arredato la pizza
��, tavola is very popular with expats in the chaoyangliangmaqiao area and it is easy to understand why they have great service beautiful presentation a stylish space and lovely dishes the food is consistently good but be aware that you will pay western prices recommend lunch over dinner families might find it a bit stuffy but the dishes seem to please
��, this is the sort of place you want to go to when its on the expense account  in which case you can enjoy the amazing beef carpaccio and the great australian steaks yes its decadent and im not sure about the vegetarian options but overall its a great restaurant however as i mentioned its expensive, le chef est italien on le voit avec plaisir guider sa brigade lors des services les plats sont tres bons

��, i recommend the lunch sets specifically lunch set a at ~120 rmb lunch set b will set you back by 150 lasagna will set you back by 108 rmb desserts are recommended such as chocolate truffle pizza appears gourmet, this is a beautiful restaurant and i love places with a kitchen in the open in the restaurant we have been in china for a bit and were looking for some more familiar food and thanks to trip advisor we found tavola what a find the place is just spectacular and world class in the decor good start the food
��, tavola is one of my favourite restaurants its near the kempinski hotel they serve high quality food great place for business dinner or lunch, we came here for an early dinner as we opted for italian food there are quite a few italian restaurants in beijing but only a few are very good this is one of the good ones well the menu is quite extensive from pizzas pastas to steaks we knew it is expensive still pizzas starts at 98 cny 17 eur
��, staying at the four seasons and not being very adventurous i did get a little bored of lucky street so decided to venture onto the other side of the road to see what was there and was pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across tavola first impressions were good the restaurant itself looks really classy decor is cool and romantic and
��, probably one of the best italian food in beijing but it comes with a high price service is good environment rather comfortable, i normally never enter italian restaurant abroad but never say never this time i was taken by my collegues to this and if you take in consideration where exactly you are it is not the worst food experience i had the dishes are actually very well taken care of and what we had was definitely fresh charcuteriesthey could definitely do
��, this was one of the best italian restaurants in beijing but standards are slipping fast the italian chef has disapeared a number of months ago the food is still generally ok but nothing spectacular for the prices one pays service is very patchy and deteriorated over the months it would be nice if someone can advice the new chef not

��, when i need a very good evening of fine italian food i go to tavola in beijing great food and service carl, having visited restaurant a few times i guessed they would offer a special ny eve menu  they did i not but it was just as good as normal and they have a very nice menu pleased to come back soon, good service nice ambient little pricy but very tasty for lunch they have a pre selection off food so it is also possible within 1h, had dinner here with friends visiting china choose this place because of location to hotels and reputation overall appearance is good there is a huge table in the middle that is interesting and the open kitchen is fun we group of 4 ordered salads and three different pizzas the salad was good but the three pizzas get mixed reviews there
��, went for lunch and the set menu options were very well priced pasta was decent enough and service was very good interior looked small but was not at all cramped and the industrial feel to the interior was not at all off putting, one of the best lunch deals in beijing very reasonable priced set lunch and the food is amazing for me the pizza was amazing and service was great dinner menu is expensive, good italian food prepared by and or under the guidance of an italian chef set lunches are good value too free wifi, its upstairs in a mall but nice inside with good service and great food i was shocked and get this  the risotto is amazing  and the gnocchi is the best, i went to tavola a couple of times food is really good style and spacious ambience stunning service is mixed some if the staff is good others not and fluctuation of service staff appears to be rather high however its an excellent italian  probably the best in beijing  in terms of food what can you expect from chinese

12,"it was a nice sunny day in beijing  i was in the mood for some beers over lunch this place hit the spot great selection of beers  the honey ma beer was tasty so were the cheese and bacon burgers will come here again, i didnt try the beer as i have quit but my wife tried a recommended by the waiter beer and she loved it sorry i forgot the name of the beer but she actually had 2 and drank them both which is something she never does i had a basic burger and it was pretty darn delicious i even enjoyed the salad the fries could have been a bit crispier but in any case my wife enjoyed her burger meal as well so we were both content with the atmosphere on that sunday afternoon we will stop again if in the area, 12 is generally very busy the food is extremely delicious  its always fresh for a western gastropub its very well priced both for food  drinks the space has an industrial feel its clean  the staff are welltrained there are tons of homebrewed beer options 2 really good options of house wine and plenty of mixed drinks to choose from they dont do pizza at 12 only at 45 the great leap franchise is run really well  its a relaxing place to hangout eat amazing food  unwind a bit in a crazy city highly recommended, its comfortable friendly and affordable here they have wifi and the best burgers around im not a beer connoisseur so i go for the 25 rmb pilsner and sip it while enjoying the tasty burger and perfectly cooked french fries i also get to catch up on my internet this is a great place, one of the best restaurants in beijing a must go the best burgers i have ever had  really great beer always a buzzing atmosphere and fast service  kind staff, great beer great burgers and nice atmosphere if youre looking for a place where you can get a good burger in beijing this is the place to go highly recommend it, great place great beers
the hamburgers were good compared to other places in the city

wonderful ipa, i have lived in china for almost two years now and this is the best restaurant i have found for american style hamburgers and pub grub it has always been busy when i have visitedthe service is also good for china which is not always the case in general i am not a huge fan of beer but their microbrews are also very good i went there with my son but he is always the only child i see so i would not say it is a great place for families, awesome place if youre from the us and looking for a taste of home in beijing great burgers fries beer and atmosphere they also take us credit cards, absolutely wonderful burger seriously good we came for the beer though i would eat half a burger but ate the whole thing just because it was wonderful
service was friendly and well paced great place to go after trying the local foods, i have tried their various burgers the knife and fork sandwich chicken sandwich and the cobb salad i have never had a bad meal all the beers i have tried are pretty good the banana one is dangerously good but also fairly expensive so that will keep people in check i really like the cinnamon ale and the stout best service isnt awesome its still china but far better than many other restaurants many which charge more, stopped for lunch and ordered salads burgers and one of their brunch sandwiches the food was good we ordered several beers all of which were cold and tasty, this place has awesome beers and food must try burgers the wait is high on weekends but it is well worth it every night they have a deal as well my favorite in beijjng, good burgers good beer good service what else can you ask for for sure the best burgers in beijing, had a few beers and dinner here on a recent business trip to beijing the great leap brewery is a little out of the way and if you have not been before it could be a little hard to find however it was definitely worth the search loved the industrial decor and concrete ceiling the place was pumping which for a week night was a pleasant surprise beers were very good and the pub grub was above typical china standards appears to be well frequented by beijing based expats which is always a good sign definitely worth a visit if you have a night in beijing, we go here for the burger not the beer i usually order gin  tonic here cuz i dont drink beer and it is good but please use more tonic seems like one of those cheep places that serve more alcohol in the mixers cuz it is cheaper than the tonic anyway it is a beer place so i am keeping this in mind the place gets super crowded and can be a nightmare to get seats so better be here early, this spot was very busy the night we visited as it is probably every night great place to get a burger and beer eating a greasy bacon cheeseburger was a nice break from chinese the house fries are awesome light and crispy there is a good variety of unique beers to choose from i ordered a flight and all four samples were fantastic, this is a great choice for a dinner with friends or a few beers after work  the chicken wings and sweet potato fries are especially good  this place gets very busy so my advise is to try and get there by six to reserve a table of reserve one by phone first , visited this spot dying on a hang over i was ready to ravage the city of beijing nay the greater beijing region for some decent western food
i wasnt disappointed it was the best burger ive had in a very long time i took one bite of my cheeseburger and i entered a parallel universe all of a sudden i was galloping down the crest of a rainbow on a golden unicorn fireworks exploded tidal waves crashed and dragons roared as i shimmied and swayed in my new found ecstasy i may have passed out at some point but thankfully al green came to my rescue he said ciara its not your time just yet run away from the light of the tunnel as fast as you can into the darkness i ran and i ran as fast as fast as my little legs would take me back to reality where i finished my glorious cheeseburger
seriously though its a bloody good burger, good atmosphere great choice of beers if rather expensive and tasty food the staff are really helpful too very busy  perhaps best to book we tried to go a second time without booking and couldnt get near the place at about 730pm and on a thursday oh recommend the chesty puller ipa, this place has a great atmosphere and the choice of beer was massive the food looks fairly straightforward burgers and salads and some of our party ate and said it was brilliant and certainly just what they wanted after a week of eating chinese food twice a day if youre in the area search this place out kids are welcome and the youre made to feel super welcome, yet another visit to the great leap and my first impression still last brought new friends and it only took one zip of the ipa and one bite of the cheese burger to convince them  best burger and beer ever txs ill be back in nov for yet another best treat, a place where you can taste american and other ethnic food  not so cheep  but not so expensive is clean and the burger are good but not so big, comfort food in laidback noisy venue reservations are possible but limited to a few tables each day and only i think for the earliest sittings while it seems crazy busy most days you wont need to wait more than a few minutes to get a table, if you need a break from chinese food and want to see what a brew pub in china is like this is the place for you the beer was interesting and fun and the food was good expect it to be crowded and noisy, big brash and busy brew pub great beer selection had a burger which some reviewers have rated highly but i thought was ok good for beer and a night out and standard pub fare more urban than the original 6 which i preferred, great atmospherevery polite  prompt service very cleanbut can get very crowded at timesthe best burger we have ever had vast selection of beerswould recommend moon dog would certainly recommend the great leap brewing to all my friends, weve enjoyed this place several times during visits to beijing the food is fresh burgers are great fries are fine and even the garden salad was really good the place is clean and customer service is definitely above average it can get crowded on weekends and in the evenings, had the bacon cheeseburger it was great with amazing flavor most options on the menu are 3060 rmb and you can sample 4 beers as a set for 50 rmb, great beers and great burgers are what this place is about one of my top 10 burgers ever probably top 5 wash the tastiness down with one of their excellent craft beers a must stop for someone wanting a proper nono sense burger and excellent beer if they had these near my hometown id definitely be a regular, excellent beers great food good service this is a very busy place but a must go when you are in beijing, large selection of craft beer fun atmosphere and fabulous burgers ground in house my personal favorite is the lamb burger with fries onion rings are beer battered greasy yumminess when you have the craving we never leave without having at least 3 beers, what can i say after 2 years of coming to beijing i finally made it to the great leap

the beer you can have the standard half meter  which is 4 samples of your choice of beer they have 13 or so of their own brews plus a couple of guest beers not all were available on the night but thats because of what they had brewed recently i guess to make it simple i had numbers 1 to 4 all excellent it made a welcome change to the craft beer places in london in that the beers were not cloudy when they arent supposed to be in london they try to tell that all craft beers are supposed to be cloudy  no way

food they have a range of burgers  doesnt sound exciting but they are really tasty and hit the spot  excellent

atmosphere its a noisy place as you might expect with lots of chatter going on you can sit at the bars or at tables that seat up to 8 if there is less of you than that you are expected to share  no problem there as everyone is there for the beer

a great place for a night out, a lot of people take their burgers seriously in beijing with the beijing publishing a yearly ranking glb always scores highly on the board but in mine and my friends opinion its the best this is down to the vast selection of beers available and the locality to both slt and gonti before a night out, great beer place many choices can pick beer shots and decide on the beer you want great food as well however not all stuff speaks english but for us was no problem chinese rules, i would consider traveling to beijing just so i could come here for a chesty puller ipa it is that good the food was really good and plenty satisfying but the beer was absolutely excellent they also have great tshirts for sale, went for beers and burgers with the family hands down the best burgers in beijing highest price is 60 rmb for a bacon cheese burger 10 rmb extra for a side salad if you go during the week for lunch 11230 buy a salad or a burger and get a free drink beer included you wont get a better burger unless you travel back to america, a western oasis in the land of noodles and rice great beers i like the illigitimate general great burgers wonderful pork belly and grilled chicken once i found this paradise i returned 4 times in 5 days before i left beijing i ordered the fried chicken appetizer with a salad to take back to my hotel for dinner thanks for making the desert of beijing tolerable, loved the food the service the beer and the atmosphere the bar has a nice style and its comfortable for a large group of people however it is often busy so beware enjoy, for a birthday we tried to book a table for 18 people at great leap their burgers to me are the best in town the atmosphere is great why not
no such luck my friends great leap isnt so welcoming when it comes to large groups i understand i worked in tourism man for many years sometimes large groups are more work than they are worth but dont accept the reservation then call back to change your mind they pretty much did anything is discourage us coming which included suggesting we come and sit at the table an hour before we wanted to eat it really was disappointing seeing how their burgers are just so tasty, best cheeseburger i ever had really greasy and delicious a bit loud in there but the cheeseburger made up for that the cookie dessert was awesome, the burger was amazing lots of different types of beers even the dessert we had just melted on the tounge some noise in the restaurant area, great leap 12 is usually always packed with foreigners who go for the beer and burgers admittedly their burgers do do the job when youre craving some greasy american food but they are extremely greasy it is definitely not the place to go id youre watching your figure also it gets very very loud at night it is actually awful to sit there if you want to have a conversation however the servers are friendly and speak english its worth a visit if youre rrrreally craving fast food and beer price wise its alright pricier than local foods but not the worst, when i first arrived in beijing  experiencing all the local street food  peking duck i craved for burgers not those mc donalds or kfc types but juicy agnus beef with melting cheese type burgers
when i shifted to dongzhimen lucky great leap was just 7mins walk behind my apartment compound  that was the start of a love affair never ending
great leap has vast variety of root beers burgers sandwiches  the best onion rings youd find anywhere at least thats what my taste buds tell me
usually on weekends this place is super crowded  so better reserve before you go otherwise prepare to wait for sometimes oh yes great leap has brunch as well on sunday i still opted for burgers but friends told me it was good enough for the money being paid , they have a vast selection of craft beer including seasonal inspired ones the reason i really of there though are their amazing burgers great place if you want to hang out with friends but at times it can get really busy and you have to wait for a table, great place to have a good microbrew beer and tasty food it gets really crowded and noisy highly recommended for hanging out, ive been in china for 6 months now and the closest thing to an american style burger has been mcdonaldsyeah i know right i sought this place out maybe its because i dont live in beijing or maybe its because following directions and streets in china can be nearly impossible but this place was very difficult to find i had a nice craft beer and bacon cheeseburger that was absolutely delicious i will be coming back for sure the next time i am in beijing, every this is the best burger ever fades away when you eat the great leap cheesburger and the many special ipa from their own brewery makes this place outstanding you do not want to miss it when in beijing, great to find good burgers in beijing the craft beer is quite good with a large selection service is spotty but there is a terrific vibe in the great leap its always busy and is a nice mix of foreigners and locals always good when you need a break from chinese food, the great leap brewing company is by far the best brewery in all of beijing china the cheeseburger is one of the best cheeseburgers that you will ever have in your entire life they brew over 20 different types of beer that taste amazing","Mexican cuisine",0.952433859325698

��, we found this on trip advisor and instantly decided it to be a mustdo during our trip to beijing we had a hard time finding it but then read all of the comments below talking about the real location once we arrived we were very happy again not an exact replica but pretty cool to see we had a few
��, i had read reviews about this place that described it as an almost perfect replica it is not however it is still a good visit worth taking the time to go visit, i just stepped back into the 90s with this cafe this is one of the best recommendations of gotten for beijing although not a local attraction its worth the trip, as described by the other reviewers this is essentially a cafe that is designed to resemble a cafe from a tv show that was popular in north america maybe at least a decade ago there is a second room that is made to look like another setting in the show as well truthfully i was never a big fan of
��, true to form  looks exactly like the friends tv set they also play episodes of friends non stop white sitting in the well replicated place there is a good tasty offerings of pastries and coffees to munch on a drink from a bit hard to find as this is on the 6th floor of a building i also strongly
��, i have seen all ten seasons of friends and thoroughly enjoyed just taking in the surroundings at central perk the place is small but the resemblance is amazing and they serve a pretty good cappuccino sometimes hard to find in beijing as someone living here for a while who gets homesick sometimes i loved sitting on the friends couch watching
��, my chinese wife loves the tv sitcom friends in fact her english vocabulary improved greatly just by watching the episodes over and over again it�s funny when i hear her use an idiom and i stop to think where she learned that as i haven�t taught her that idiom and the answer undoubtedly is from friends therefore we heard about
��, awesome just as the tv show a must see very creative and obviously with great customer service it just makes it an incredible cafe brilliant work, it is very hard to find the place but manageable based on the descriptions below the address is pinned wrong

��, being an american in beijing on business one of the girls i work with said we needed to go i went and it was incredible the inside is spot on central perk from the show really cool they have it allgood coffee good cupcakes and great staff and prices definitely a place to get away for an hour, its incredible that such a impressive cafe exists in beijing someone is obviously a big fan of the show because once youre there youre really there on the show its not just the attention detail but the feel of the cafe yes it actuallys good as a working cafe too although it feels more cosy than what you see on
��, i went to this place on a friends recommendation she warned me about the eh coffee and the decent desserts so i went and average is what i got the atmosphere was goodpeople inside were very into themselves the waitresses need to learn about customer service and to smile the owner needs to not hit on the waitresses and hit

��, we had our lunch here food was good at taste and preparation manager was very generous and kind and quite interactive the reataurant is not very far from capital airport region it is around 5km so not very far has a good menu but on a little higher side cost wise yes the masala chai is good again its costly
��, the service was prompt vegetarian fare is as elaborate as non veg the owner of the restaurant takes personal care of all the guests slightly difficult to find ambience is also good with full fledged bar, place is quite inexpensive better indian food than many of the other ones we tried in beijing breads were delicious and well made service was courteous and accommodating of allergies and preferences, nice to find a good indian food  beijing good serving  good environment just oppostie to exhibition center, we had a buffet dinner in a group of 40 people the decor and sitting arrangement was very good the food was very well cooked preserving all the flavours most delicious indian food we had in china, the manager was there and he was not there invisible most of the time he controlled the service and food and converses with you if you choose very knowledgeable and makes sure you get the dishes to your taste, i came here for lunch and had a filling and delicious meal the menu has pictures with english descriptions i ordered one of the set meals for 49 rmb the place is clean and bright the hosts speak english and are eager to answer any questions it takes effort to find this place as it is away from the main

��, i was carving for indian food and would not compromise on taste my local chinese friend suggested this hotel i was not sure if it will meet my expectations i thought it would be some chinese indian type like our indian chinese  the ambiance was great indian style and the staff were also indians this made me feel good
��, it is five years now that jasmeet kalsi who runs the taj pavilion takes care of me and my friends from india whenever we are in beijing you will be treated with a homely smile and suggest different dishes everyday all the foods are really good and make you feel that you are in india surprisingly lot of local population

��, so first things first like a lot of places in beijing the actual restaurant is nowhere near the place that the trip advisor map says in fact trip advisor is pointing to a derelict soon to be demolished building so once that is out of the way the taj pavilion is in a building about 400 meters away its is

��, we havent had indian food for a while and we were looking forward to this we had a couple of non spicy things like butter chicken and went for the big spicy hitters it didnt disappoint we all had the good slow burn from the spices excellent food quality great attentive service would revisit, great indian food only complaint was when i went here there was no one else in the restaurant so it was extremely quiet and a little awkward, if you are in beijing and want to taste indian food then must visit taj pavilion their food environment and service are good they also have home delivery service, the food in the taj was good  was at a decent price too the service could be improved else everything was good, what a great find in beijing mr pastakia made a reservation for special dinner for our group on e mail and kept in touch great food at a good price service was personal  we had gujarati menu special ordered but other food also smelled just right  excellent ambience and wait staff was just terrific with the manager owner

��, we order regularly from the lido after going to the guomao this past summer for a goodbye dinner weve tried all the big indian restaurants that weve found in bj and this is our fave like the other posters have said the staff at the guomao restaurant are lovely and attentive we found the food to be the best here
��, we stumbled on the taj pavilion while looking for something else and followed signs in to a quiet shopping mall
��, service staff was able to handle a large group of friends with a day notice there were slight difficulties in communicating in english the food quality was very good the atmosphere was excellent wide variety of entree selections from the menu, my husband and i live in beijing and we eat at the lido branch of this restaurant at least once a week the food is delicious and freshly cooked you can order a la carte however there is a business set lunch for less than $8 that includes generous portions of rice chicken or mutton curry two different vegetable dishes
��, average food in generic indian spices i suppose it is fine given the lack of indian restaurants in beijing but unless youre an indian who is really really homesick this place isnt worth going to, ive been here several times in the past till last year it was located in a space on the street in the world trade center building now its loctaed within a shopping mall within the wtc building but it has lost somenthing atmosphere has changed probably larger spaces but it lost some warmth typical of the older space also food

��, i cannot say the dumplings we had were not good but after 15 days in china i can assure you we tried a lot of better tasting dumplings i would say they were about average the big problem was indeed the service nobody speaks a word of english not even the basics you would think in the capital and in
��, read quite a few china tourism websites that recommended this restaurant but when we tried the dumplings there we were disappointed they tasted okay but the dumpling skin was too thick and the filling wasnt very juicy we had the cabbage with peanut sauce as well it was quite good but there was too much sauce, if u wanna try shaomai u defenetly have to go there just take the metro line 2 to qianmen and then just go throgh the big portal and then go south  nan u will see an entire street in european style, still keep authentic steam dumpling service is about average you cant expect much on that the point is this place
��, an outstanding place for lunch excellent food and great ambiance watch out the menu is only in chinese so go along with a local the beer is great they serve draft the place is full of chinese so you can imagine the food is excellent the prices are very reasonable, we visited this restaurant following lonely planet recommendation what a disappointment the food was overpriced the dumplings were average and dry and the service was so so we paid more for this average meal which was only a lunch than at some restaurants where we ate peking duck fro dinner give it a miss, its said theres a famous story about its history  long time ago theres an empire of china returned to

13,"in a great ambiance you can have your own beijing duck freshly cooked in the ovens next to the tables so you see the chefs at work
duck is cut at your table and served with loads of goodies to add more flavors
they also have a great menu with a la carte dishes
dont forget to make reservations otherwise you might end up waiting for a long time but then again waiting with a glass of something tasty at the bar it is also good, dont leave beijing without trying the dadongs roasted duck the restaurant has a great menu with gourmet and traditional chinese options, i was invited by our chinese friends who knows all the best places in town and we were not disappointed
fantastic food and very comfortable
restaurant is very big so do not expect intimacy but if you are a foody you dont care
high quality and i can recommend it to everybody, our tour of beijing included a dinner at this famous establishment there were six of us and we were escorted into a private dining room we watched with amazement at the skillful manner the chef so expertly removed every morsel of duck meat my previous experience with duck was always bad because it was not obviously prepared in this manner with a shade of doubt i wish i could have had more to eat but the accompanying dishes were more than expected the plum sauce slathered on the sliced duck meat was so yummy i must stop im beginning to salivate just thinking about it a visit to this restaurant will be most rewarding, love the large open modern space kind of a surprise because you enter a non descript building get in the elevator andvoila duck was delicious went with hubbys biz associate who ordered everything in chinese and the yummy food just showed up tons of it nice wait staff, the duck and side dishes were excellent also the starters from the extensive menu list the aperitif whisky sour wasnt woth the price  just about 4cl incl the ice and lemon

wine list is also a lot of pages but as usual for good ones in china they are overpriced

one problem is the service it looks like it is not their profession they serve dishes over the plates of others and were generally not very motivated

summary the duck is worth it and consider around 30 eurperson for it, english menu available and better service than traditional beijing duck rest but price is not really friendly for business meal or overseas guests treatment would be a good idea, dadong seems to be one of the most recommended restaurant for beijing duck we picked this one because it was within walking distance from our hotel
our tour guide called to make reservation for us the day before the setting was nice and the restaurant was nicely decorated the menu was thick and full of nice pictures of dishes we ordered the original style duck about c$280 and a few more dishes to go with it the food was served quickly and the chef cut the duck behind our table the duck was not as good as we expected the skin was crisp but not too tasty meat was again ok but not great overall we prefer the southern style roast duck we felt that this was somewhat overrated as for the other dishes we really enjoyed the thick chestnut soupstew we were surprised that each one of us was charged for the condiments for the duck not a big deal but had never seen this before at the end the provided a free dessert fresh jujubes red dates it was quite refreshing and tasty
i would recommend this restaurant if one hasnt tried beijing duck before but if you have tried traditional southern style roast duck eg in hong kong you wont miss much but skipping this, being in beijing for the eve of chinese new year meant there werent many good options around but our hotel recommended dadong as it was close by upon arriving it appeared they had a special new year menu which included half a duck and trimmings duck soup and dumplings which was about 200 rmb in total and sufficient for two people we also ordered a vegetable side of mushrooms and bamboo 75 rmb and some voss water 60 rmb overall the quality of the food was extremely high probably the best duck ive tasted in beijing the service of the waiters was also very high they covered all of our bags to keep them clean and safe gave us a brief lesson on different ways to eat the duck and left us with a pretty red lantern to commemorate the new year the english of the staff was adequate for ordering but doesnt stretch much beyond that although a little pricy the experience at dadong was worth the investment for a truly memorable dinner on chinese new year eve, beijing duck was very authentic and reasonably priced would suggest half a duck for 2 people with condiments as well as ordering some other dishes too amazing display of the roast duck being cooked, a very trendy place to dine with the duck being roasted in a centre display kitchen surrounded by koi ponds and then tables the duck is delicious the koi entertained my kids for hours perfect, their duck is a heavenly one very crispy on the outside very juicy in the inside one of the best ive tasted would have given a 5 if it werent so pricey, went to this place because of very good recommend in tripadvisor best restaurant in beijing great place and great food staffs are really friendly and helpful service is very good lovely restaurant in beijing highly recommended , the food at dadong is fantastic we ordered the peking duck which has a fabulously crispy skin pork dumplings goose liver pate bamboo shoots and asparagus all great the only down side is we waited 20 minutes even though we had a reservation and its really pricey, do not forget to book a table in advance a modern interior looks like being specially designed for the foreigners maybe  just to create more comfortable atmosphere however no worries the meal is typically chinese no chances to go through all the menu as its size including pictures is incredibly huge
roast duck is a must for sure the most important thing is that if a visitor is a newbie the special lesson could be given how to eat this dish or another one properly in the line of the correct procedure
deserts are a special subject leave space in a stomach for them
unbelievable and real chinese hospitality, i went with my friend for dinner duck is super awesome chef cutting skill is finest service is good restaurant ambience is also good duck soup is tasty sesame dessert is very sweet duck feet with wasbai is must try if you are wasabi fan, restaurant is huge modern worth to visit just to admire its greatness food was super delicious menu is extensive and innovative beautiful dish presentation amazing flavours take the beijing duck but order some other dishes from the menu very nice desserts as well, love the roast duck the skin so crispy the restaurant is nice ambience nice service with a high quality food will be come back here again when i visit beijing, i had the opportunity to dine at this restaurant during a business trip we had an elegant room for ourselves a group of 7 people our host a beijing resident ordered a sweetsour pork chicken a flatfish a very special salad soup and the famous roasted duck everything was excellent the different flavors characterizing each dish were well harmonized together yet they contained the strong character of beijing cuisine the service was excellent we brought our own wine and they serviced it appropriately overall it was an great experience i cannot comment on the bill as it was taken care by our host i definitely recommend this restaurant, went with a group and had no problems food was good to excellent and the service was great had about 15 dishes including peking duck and all dishes were very well presented and had good flavor, we choose this place cause it is very well reviewed on tripadvisor and was also the closest peking duck restaurant to our hotel after all a bit dissapointed like when in beijing u should eat peking duck okay taste was good but not wow also it is quite expensive for what u get because it was our first time we ordered a small duck to share it is really small they come with the whole duck to your table and cut the meat in front of you nice ofcourse but it takes such a long time that when they serve the meat is was really cold presentation was modern more like in a chique hamburger way restaurant itself is nicely decorated rather big which makes atmosphere less cosy nice restrooms , we made a reservation through the the hotel concierge of park plaza we only wanted to taste the peking duck and were told this restaurant had the best in the area plus it was only a 2minute walk from our hotel there were 9 of us in the group it started out goodour table was ready when we got there and was assigned a staff member who understood english however the waitress was changed after we were given the menus we were presented with tomes for the menu on appetizers entrees and wine and beverages so only one set for the table and not one for each person they were literally books we had one person decided as it would take too long if we passed around the menus and had each person go through the books one at a time all we really wanted was to taste the duck my friend ordered 2 ducks for our table and then asked as to pick from 3 varieties of soup when those orders were given to the waitress she said we should order more as the duck would take 20 minutes to cook she also told us to look at the other tables and see that other customers have a lot of food on their tables this was so insulting we were all not that hungry as we had a big breakfast and lunch soup and the peking duck were all that we wanted she reiterated that the duck would take a long time to cook my friend decided to just order some dumplings and small buns just in case the soup was not enough fine then we ordered beverages most of us wanted tea and the beverage book was handed to me i didnt see a table of contents right away so i asked our snobbish waitress where the tea section was an also mentioned that we wanted green tea sh turned the pages to the tea section but there was no indication on the list which were green tea and no english description of the tea but just the chinese names i told her we were not chinese wasnt that obvious so i had no idea from the chinese names which ones were green teas i asked for her recommendation and we settled on that very bad service from this one staff anyway the duck came first before our soup nor dumplings none of the soup that we ordered was memorable the peking duck was good and another wait staff demonstrated how to assemble the meat with the condiments and the wrappershe was nice although he didnt speak english the rest of our orders were ok my recommendation is look somewhere else for peking duck this restaurant is overrated, peking duck is one of my favourite things to eat and easily accessible in hong kong where i live i found this nice but nothin special the meat was a little dry it was quite good value though not as expensive as i thought it would be, this was roast not crispy duck quite skillful how it was carved a bit of ceremony anyway for me it was average but i must say chinese food is not my favourite,  it has won all sorts of awards for best restaurant etc as the front entrance walls were adorned with plaques to verify such and we had a 7 pm reservation dadong was a very nice classy place centrally located in the restaurant was the duck roastery a place with four open flame ovens wood fired and in each one was placed 35 ducks our table was a large and glass and we seemed further apart than usual we had 3 wait staff and were well looked after even though one or more of our staff seemed a bit new to the job we ordered a bottle of white wine we ordered a large duck and 34 vegetable dishes each one a taste of diversity chop sticks were the norm as in most restaurants in china dadong was no different

at one point after our duck had been delivered one of the staff came by and showed us how to properly eat our duck with a 1 either a touch of sugar for the outside skin 2 a puffed open pastry in which we would place the duck with various condiments that he suggested 3 the last method was placing the duck with various other condiments in a rice tortilla and then folding it over using the chopsticks  quite a feat in and of itself all were delicious the four of us had no trouble devouring the whole duck, you can like or dislike the modern decoration it does not matter because the food is exceptional the duck is perfect but so are the different dishes we had a great truffle soup and some foie gras hidden in cherry looking red balls, the duck and in general the food were very good and i didnt even think i liked duck we had a lovely reception from the hostess and someone brought us a free glass of water with lime while we waited for our party but once we sat down service was extremely inattentive we were in a private room and members of our party had to get up multiple times and go out of the room to dine someone to order things from out party was a mix of locals and foreigners and i think everyone felt the service was lacking, the service here is as good as you would expect and the duck is crispy with the sides being the perfect compliment for two people order a whole duck, this is the place to go if you�re looking to �splurge� on a highend meal but not burn your wallet too much in the process in addition to the wellcelebrated roast duck diners are treated to two heavy and cumbersome menus with dishes bearing all the floss and foam that you�d expect from an episode of chef�s table

our party of 3 walked in after 8pm on a weeknight were seated in 15mins ordered half a duck wine and a couple of dishes we also received a selection of free dishes too  including two desserts in all we set ourselves back by less than <u+00a5>800 ~$130 usd

overall one of my favorite eats in beijing  we cant say enough about them, our hotel booked this location of dadong because it was just a short walk but we just loved this dinner we had no idea how to navigate the 150page menu so we let our waiter order for us duck for two with the condiments asparagus fried rice and a great tuscan blend wine they also have a full bar with another 100+ page beverage menu it is crowded and a bit of a fast pace to start but you can relax after your meal arrives make a reservation for sure all in all a great beijingpeking experience, as you know the culinary speciality of beijing is the roast duck i was advised to go to this restaurant and it was the good advise there we can eat the real traditional roast duck like for centuries ago i tried other restaurant for the same dish and it was the best dont hesitate to go, my all time favorite food is pekin duck <3
i tried many since i love it so much i had bad to wonderful experiences and i have to say that this restaurant is one if the best i have

the skin of the duck is thin well roasted and not too fat the crepes are perfect the condiments are nice when you eat it its the perfect balance

i tried the vip and suckling duck and i think i liked the vip best

i tried a dumpling on the side but it wasnt very good oh well doesnt matter i came for the duck, the restaurant is in a back yard in the center of beijingit ultra fancy and the public is beijings upper classbut the show is over done the menu weights 3 kilos and is so big that you can hardly carry it in your hands it is over charged with meals to choose that it take half an hour to check the offer the waiters dont understand a glue of english or any other languageand it seems to be a fast food restaurant the dishes are coming so fast that you havent any time to enjoy the venueour impression was this was a lot of show instead of real service and foodif you are looking for a beijing duck the qiamen quanjude is definitively a better choicethe worst was they are unable to order a taxi that brings you back to the hotel , this is one of the most overrated restaurants we had a reservation which eventually the staff found without it i doubt we would have been able to eat there however when we got to the restaurant upstairs it was enormous and with mainly empty tables by western standards the food is cheap but it is not worth going there must be many better places to get peking duck, we of course had the roast duck we sat right next to the pond with a great view of the kitchen where they have big ovens to roast the whole ducks heads still attached 

being unfamiliar with how to eat the duck once served the very friendly staff demonstrated everything even if they didnt speak english it was by far some of the best peking duck we have ever had recommend to anyone who visits beijing, specialising in high quality duck dishes the restaurant is modern and stylish and feels exclusive without being too formal

attentive staff helped make it a very enjoyable evening  its not cheap but its not extortionate either and provides a much deserved bit of luxury after a long hard day of tourism, this restaurant is the epitome of exquisite chinese cuisine that i had the fortune of tasting in beijing

over the course of our trip my wife and i had 3 peking ducks in beijing at 3 restaurants this was by far the most stunning and delicious the duck skin is crispy but melts in your mouth the duck has the fragrance of the wood smoke the duck bones are boiled into a light broth for you

their other dishes are all delightful i really loved their sweet and sour pork in most restaurants ketchup is used as its the easiest to create the sour flavor here sour plums are used the fragrance and flavor is refreshing yet alluring

the attention to detail in the presentation of the dishes is astonishing for every dish i felt like i was eating an artwork

the service is also top notch friendly and eager to assist

if you have only one restaurant youre willing to pay for when you are in beijing choose dadong, the taste of the roast duck is so so compare with the price killing me it is only for the group of people with no idea about the true taste of beijing roast duck you paid for the decoration so called service more, the peking duck here is the finest i have ever had this is an excellent restaurant with very good service and all at a reasonable price, this place offers the best pekin duck and they also serve a fantastic abulon great wine list the service is not good not different than most chinese restaurants we had to pour our own wine and wait for the check for 20 minutes, we had a lovely dining experience here duck fantastic pork fantastic well everything really taste wise and some unusual dishes maybe a bit pricey but not excessively staff were excellent and some do speak english more so than in other restaurants where you have to rely more on pictures great experience, we ate here on the recommendation of a friend who had recently entertained here on expenses and who raved about the peking sorry beijing duck so the four of us duly booked and went along for the experience now im used to cooking this dish at home and including pancakes and spring onion and cucumber and hoisin i can feed four people for a budget of maybe twelve quid and if we go to a restaurant that figure maybe doubles but at dadong you are looking at upwards of forty quid for small duck that will barely suffice as a starter and if you order a main course thereafter you are looking at paying le gavroche prices for frankly bogstandard chinese fayre the surroundings are prettyish the service is okayish the duck is� well precisly how it always is� but the prices are indefensible we had 1 starter and 4 beers and then relocated to molly malones 20 yards down the street which is based back in the real world, our hotel tried to book us a table that same morning but bookings were full we were told that we can still go as the restaurant accept walkins took the metro and a 5min walk to the jinbao hui bldg very easy to locate had a good reception from the hosts at the door 20 mins of waiting time at the bar overall a good experience  love the peking duck and the various dishes we had besides the peking duck the other servings are small and very well presented so we managed to order a variety of dishes had a bottle of chilean red that is reasonably priced  pretty good the restaurant offers free wifi we were there on a weekday night and judging by the crowd one can get a table quite readily if you walk in after 8pm, amazing experience and even better food some of the staff speaks english and the menu has pictures to guide your choices get the vip duck and you will be so pleased, we have been for a diner and it is absolutely a great restaurant pecking duck is really good prices are not so expensive, okay its pricey but just worth it anything we ordered was outstanding no matter what we pock veggies dumplings beijing duck etc
we had a separate room table for 5 with 2 kids and i would always get back service was super and the restaurant is well designed and looks fancy if you want to experience authentic local food and highest level than this is the place to be, delicious meal in a modern and fashionable place interesting to look at the local crowd around
a little bit too much of an industry like restaurant though, we have picked out 3 pecking duck restaurants to try while we were in beijing low med and highend and dadong was obviously the most high end of the three and more than what we expected

we were ushered to the bar while our table was being prepared where the wine list was extensive and impressive with both local and international wines

we were served by the nicest floor staff and easily the best experience through our month long travel in china she was polite knowledgeable and super friendly she has elevated our dinning experience at the restaurant

we ordered one whole standard size duck 2 ways and one another dish asparagus and bamboo shoots with truffle oil it didnt disappoint

the duck came with the usual pancake and sauces and additional condiments such as 2 types of pickles and a baked sesame pocket the sugar was used to dip the skin in and both the duck skin and sugar just melts in your mouth

then there is the norma way of eating the duck in pancake except the pickled cabbage added additional depth and texture

the pickle <u+91ac><u+74dc> was then used to clean the palette between the 2 ways of eating the duck

the soup was flavoursome and a nice addition to the duck where the temperature washed away the fat

to finish off we were served free local fruit called <u+51ac><u+68d7> and chinese black sesame pudding what a way to end the meal

its probably the second best peking duck ive had in my life and ive had a few the service decor and cleanliness was second to non and you can be assured that there wont be any issues with the food served in this restaurant

amazing impressive and we will be back, compared to most eating places in beijing dadong is a little priceybutit is totally worth it they offer 5 star service and the food is absolutely beautiful, one of my favorite dining experiences on the planet

amazing beijing duck perfectly prepared and presented

lots of other great dishes on the menu as well from seafood pork and vegetables to great soups

��, this restaurant does excellent food from yunnan i would recommend drinking a yunnan beer with your meal as well it is better than a local beijing beer for sure the menu has a little of something for all tastes spicy sweet sour vegetarian fish and lots of meat an excellent choice i go at least once a month, just off the sanlitun bar street behind a i presupposing brick facade lies this good yunnan restaurant the wine list is small and the ordering system is via ipad which is not my favorite but the food is spot on  fresh well spiced and balanced the aussie beef dish was a particular standout but all the dishes we chose
��, go here with a group that doesnt mind sharing dishes and you can enjoy a slice of the wide variety they offer service is not the most attentive and dont expect much english menus however offer photos and often too vague english translations to help guide options, visited middle 8th on a business trip to beijing with 4 colleagues it serves yunan food which seems like a great combination of the different regional varieties you find in china  something spicy fantastic pork great fish vegetarian  everyone loved it the ipad menu was really cool and probably meant that we ordered more than we needed 
��, this place seems really popular but we felt the food was pretty ordinary the stand out dish was a mushroom dish  cant remember the name and i dont think they had any wine certainly none by the glass, dont be put off by the shopping mall venue  the restaurant is serene and feels modern but traditional oder via ipad big veggie selection and good drinks menu very well priced too, <u+5df2><u+7d93><u+5403><u+904e><u+5e7e><u+6b21><u+4e2d>8<u+6a13><u+5728><u+5317><u+4eac><u+4e5f><u+4e0d><u+53ea><u+4e00><u+5bb6><u+5e97><u+3002>

��, note this is for the middle 8 restaurant located in building 8 above the starbucks and near the apple store in sanlitun village this is not the other sanlitun location just a few minutes walk away the original location as i refer to it simply put dont come here go to the original location their ipad ordering system even baffled
��, we were really excited to go there because we heard great things about the place the restaurant is really pretty decorated and all the pictures in the menu look great but when it came down to food i found almost all the dishes average i love spicy food but the food there was too spicy that you lost all taste
��, a great restaurant with good service and wonderful food located in the central more western parts of beijing great value for money and there are just so many exciting dishes you have to try i normally do not like chinese food at all but this was a completely different experience yunnan food includes lots of mushrooms and there where many

��, beyond the average yunan restaurant very popular in sanlitun area delicious fish hope things can be more organic, ive just recently had dinner there again with a friend and though i have always liked the yunnanese food there the new menu has just taken their game up to new best marks loved the goat cheese with prawns and of course the traditional pork ribs wrapped in banana leaves as well as their pineapple rice go up the lift
��, the title of my review has summarised my impression about this restaurant it is conveniently located within the sanlitun taikoo village perfect for a meal after shopping we ordered two soup noodles one fried pork one yunnan chicken soup and one assorted vegetables and tofu in soup my bro also ordered a nonalcoholic drink the bill was just around rmb230
��, note that there are two nearby locations a friend and i eventually found each other at the original bunkerlike corner place in a hutong extensive picturesque menu with good food to match, im always on the lookout for good yunnan food in beijing and this has become one of my favorites if youre going to be in or near sanlitun its definitely worth a try diverse menu lots of yunnan favorites, best meal in beijing beats ghost st hua delicious spicy taste sensations eggplant lemongrass chicken eggplant mushroom beef and mushroomgreen

��, love element fresh in beijing the menu offers lots of choice and the food is very fresh and tasty its really refreshing to come here because the food at element fresh  especially the salads  are sure to make you feel healthy and revived much of the food in china is heavy so this is a refreshing change also
��, great food nice place really delicious  especially the fresh juices are amazing i loved the soups and sandwiches and its very nice to sit outside with nice lanterns in the evening, honestly i dont really get the success of this place is it because its american so its fashionable to eat
��, i havent been to element fresh for a few months i went to today and boy have things went down hill my goodness this place used to be amazing but it is far from that now i usually order a sandwich and a side salad 25 rmb i ordered it today and they have a new menu the thing is
��, like this place  food is good and big portions only thing i think its littlebit pricy for salads around 80100rmb  well they are huge  fresh smoothies are delicious and they have very good list of them  all kinds service is just ok slow most of the time usually very busy in lunch times style of restaurant
��, my favorite restaurant for salad and healthy food in beijing price is suited for expat though though healthy its tasty, i went their for brunch the food is really good service and environment quite good they have a very good brunch menu but one problem that i faced is they dont have options in meat as a muslim i dont eat pork and they dont have any beefchicken sausage option also i think they need to improve the english level

the stay were very helpful  our baby is gluten free and they were happy to cook the gluten free pasta but didnt have any there already we had taken with us and to make a sauce for him they even brought gluten free bread to begin, fratelli fresh is one of my favorite restaurants in beijing
if you are looking for authentic intalian food fratelli fresh is the place to go
chef stefano will make sure that you enjoy your meal

if you are not sure what to chose ask the staff they are very competent, chefs are the most important factor of a restaurant and stefano had done a great job he had inspired me to appreciated italian food i loved his food and liked his personality very much, i am a frequent visitor to fratelli still arguably the best highend italian restaurant in beijing hostchef stefano is a great personality atmosphere is great food excellent service without reproach, chef stefano brings his energy and sharp culinary skills to the restaurant every night i have had several great meals here from the pizza to the pasta to the seafood everything is done very well and chef is happy to accommodate special requests come with an appetite and leave with a full stomach and smile on your face, i am sorry for this late review because i just returned to the us i was in asia for business and was in beijing china i stayed at the renaissance beijing capital hotel i went to the italian restaurant in the hotel named fratelli i have been to many italian restaurants all over the world but this place is by far one of the best due to the excellent italian dishes prepared by chef stefano balduccio chef stefano does not only create delicious meals but is very personable who cares about how his guests enjoy his wonderful meals as well i highly recommend anyone visiting beijing to go visit chef stefano at fratelli in the renaissance beijing capital hotel best italian food 5 stars
tell him lawrence sent you  , spent some time in bejing over the thanksgiving holiday first time away from the usa during thanksgiving had a late arrival and stayed at the beijing capital renaissance hotel had some special request had a late night after hour meal prepared and sent to my room and chef stefano balducci at fratellie fresh was very accommodating if visiting beijing and want a great atmosphere and great italian food fratellie fresh is a definite place to visit didnt miss usa thanksgiving at all, fratelli fresh is an innovative yet traditional italian restaurant you can find the international atmosphere of a multicultural beijing and also the very genuine taste of traditional italian cuisine with wellcalibrated genuine ingredients in exquisite essential yet never ordinary dishes i have to mention the amusing chef stefano balduccios kind and warm welcome that was part of our evening delight there he takes care personally of all the dishes and even explained to us some cooking recommendations, chef stefano is amazing and personable he speaks to you through his food highly recommend this an oasis of italiansicilian amidst the largeness of beijingchina asian, we had just finished a long day in beijing and took our kids on a 2hour walk on the great wall it was our sons birthday and he said he wanted italian so we went to trip advisor and decided on fratelli fresh within a few minutes of arriving the chef came by our table and we began asking about the menu he spent several minutes talking to us and helped us choose the dishes based on what everyone wanted

the bread came out and was amazing hands down the best balsamic vinegar we have had in a long time everything was great and cooked to perfection the pizza was great a good blend between thin and thick crust

this is definitely worth a stop if you want a good place for dinner thanks for the warm hospitality, best italian food i have had in beijing since moving here from michigan friday night walked in with no reservations and got a nice quiet booth for my wife and i my wife ordered a salad and i had the risotto paired with a nice house wine nothing fancy or over the top first the bread came with a wonderful balsamic and oil side excellent the balsamic was thick and almost chocolate like bread was crusty on the outside with a fluffy center all the better to soak up either the butter or the delicious oil and vinegar salad came and was very good and the risotto was excellent creamy and homemade with savory mushrooms so the meal was excellent great food carefully prepared and presented
however what makes this even better is that the chef and owner stefano visits each table at some point throughout the meal he is a big italian gentlemen with a smile and laugh to match his size this is a small thing but it really makes for a nice dinning experience we have recommended fratelli fresh to at least 20 people already here in beijing and we are looking forward to making this one of our go to spots for friends and family, im not sure im reviewing the correct fratellis i had dinner at the wine bar and restaurant not the little cafe anyway i was early for my dinnerfirst one in for the night i dont like a heavy dinner so opted for a bread board a glass of sparkling wine and the best fish soup ive ever had so rich and brimming with sea delights there was a slight kick to the tomato based broth stefano the chef came over and we chatted for a bit i live outside of beijing but will be back for sure for another perfect weekend away, we recently had dinner at fratellifresh and it was super experience and far exceeded our expectations the main reasons why we chose to eat at fratellifresh italian restaurant was because we knew the food was good and i was home sick for some great italian home cooking after being on the road in china for the previous 2 weeks without question stefano the head chef for the marriott renaissance capital in beijing and his team did better than good the food was outstanding
the atmosphere was festive and the service was great no waiting and everyone was extremely responsive as stefano demonstrated by example what service quality and hospitality is and the team absolutely followed based on his leader led example
the host asked us where we would like to sit and we chose a booth in the back near the cooking area to enjoy the view of the preparation process the restaurant is very well decorated and very well maintain organized with a focus on the client�s comfort and sense of being welcomed
the attentiveness of the waitress made us feel like we were her only table however she had multiple tables to deal with as we finished dinner brian one of the marriott�s management advised us that since i was a marriott goldplatinum we would also get a 30 discount which was very pleasant surprise and therefore the price value for our dining experience was off the chart for a great great value for a dining event
i strongly recommend when staying at the marriott renaissance capital in beijing or if you�re in the capital area to try the fratellifresh italian restaurant
i really want to give a shout out to stefano and his team as well as brian for really doing a great job i don�t do reviews often but this was so exceptional and so deserving i had to submit these comments
hope everyone takes the opportunity to visit the marriott renaissance capital beijing and for sure have dinner in stefano�s great restaurant bon appetit, by far the best italian restaurant in beijing and doubtless one of the best western restaurants in town generally
my wife and me  german citizenships living in beijing for approx 25 years  have been at fratelli fresh for a couple of times and it<u+00b4>s always been amazing
italian chef stefano ensures that the food  doesnt matter if you eat the handmade pasta the authentic pizza or one of the delicious desserts  is simply outstanding however also the service is always doing an outstanding job  especially andy is probably one of the best service staff you can find in town  his passion  service is just impressive 
hence theres absolutley nothing you could complain about when eating at fratelli fresh, it is always a pleasure to return time and time again to this great italian restaurant

i come from europe but i have been living in beijing for 4 years so when i want my italian fix i always come here
both brian restaurant manager and stefano italian chef extraordinaire will take good care of you
if something is not in the menu the chef can prepare it for you

also you should ask the chef to prepare his signature caffe
lattethe best



enjoy your next meal there and the great selection of wines as well

bon appetit, im half italian so i love italian food and i always like to eat italian food even when away from home as a discerning traveler i like to eat in really good italian restaurants around the globe the one thing that amaze me every time i come back at fratelli fresh is that i feel like if im back home at my family house where our personal chef is prepping great meals for us everyday this is what is happening when you are walking through the door of fratelli stefano the master chef of the restaurant welcomes you and i dont even need to look at the menu i just ask him sfefano what are you going to cook for me tonight and then you see his eyes get bright as he start telling you all the fresh pasta dishes the appetizers the meat and fish he can prep for you to me this is priceless so when you go there please let yourself indulge by stefano many temptations and enjoy his culinary ride, we returned here again last week or favorite go to restaurant in beijing perfect from the first bite until the last
advice get the chocolate cake, had several dishes here and all were nice nonetheless was terribly shocked to see that a bottle of water was priced at 89rm which was far more than 2 of our dishes in a country where water is not expensive absolute rip off considering it is a hotel restaurant
will not be eating here again despite the fact the food and service was good, i was surprised at how good and authentic this italian food was the bolognese sauce is how my parents make it and i loved the fresh pasta and bread the service was excellent, stayed at the renaissance and this is the western restaurant of the hotel specialising in italian there is the usual pasta and pizza but we opted for the fiorentina steak it was good the wine we ordered was out of stock and they offered a more expensive one a good restaurant will offer the new wine at the old price but this one didnt, i spent my last evening at this restaurant and i am glad we did the quality and service was fantastic yes its not cheap but you get what you pay for try it, immaculately presented food we had a lovely evening the chef stefano stopped by our table and entertained us and advised some wonderful desserts we felt very well looked after, this is a normal italian restaurant in beijing as it is located in the marriott maybe because it is more expensive than other italian restaurants in beijing we were several friends there took very common italian meals as lasagna for example and even pizza they are ok but nothing special the service is also quite ok i would say friendly staff, no chef stefano and ok italian fare the kids enjoyed their pizza but the spaghetti bolongaise was ho hum the steak was hooked well honestly nothing to write home about i say get out and try some local food instead, fratelli fresh offered italian food wellprepared and manager brian bravo is the soul of service and conviviality, food at this restaurant is amazing  we really enjoyed the conversation with their chef stefane who made our evening joyful with complementary desert offered by him was amazing wine was also nice
everytime e go there he has always something new to discuss  no need to order food there as he recommends you a good food everyime as per your taste buds, what a wonderful experience this is one of the best places i have ever eaten the ambiance is excellent the aroma sublime the service impeccable and the food bella bella chef stefano makes this a great personal experience with six business guests at dinner asian and american he made this a wonderful experience suggesting the wine personalizing the menu during the ordering cracking some jokes and keeping the staff hopping chef stefano made this a memorable experience it was so nice we stayed well into the evening enjoying the excellent red wines and some nice petite desserts really an exceptional experience a must visit for high end italian food in beijing bon apatite, real delicious cakes with a good cup of tea a very pleasant in fratellifresh

big thanks to cole the manager that couldnt have been more helpful and friendly he looked after us so well

i have to say that the staff are absolutely lovely and are a joy to be surrounded by


we will certainly come back again

yigal, best service impressive looking restaurant and great food especially if you are tired of the chinese food, we went for a family dinner with our mum and close friend at this friendly neighborhood italian restaurant where we met the crazy sicilian head chef we had a great time chatting to him about real pepperoni and thoroughly enjoy the delicious plate of complementary meat with his specialty desert wine which he kindly shares with us it was an enjoyable meal with lots of entertainment thank you for the great time, the beef was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly prepared risotto and salad with house dressing were delicious, amazing experience at fratelli fresh while in beijing china familiar food served with superior flavor in a relaxed atmosphere the staff was extremely attentive to every need, delicious food not too expensive great staff one of the best meals ive ever enjoyed the soup and lasagna and pizza were all divine, i came twice for the 3 course lunch set and found it delicious both times it is really welldone classic italian food that will satisfy your italian cravings here in beijing i also just want to mention that the bread is really really good service is also good and the lunch the set is good value sorry for using the word good so many times, i had a tuna sandwich heated and a beervery good on both counts and the staff just cant do enoughoutside seating was casual and enjoyable, we had such a great evening at fratelli been here thanks to a good review from tripadvisor all was good food ambiance and service absolutely lovely, the quatro stagioni pizza was delicious and the service was superb especially caroline is a very good hostess and gives the best service when visiting beijing again will definitely go back again, chef stephano and the manager were very accomodating the service was good as it was suppose to be for a fine dining restauranti had three coursesthe caprese and the arriabiatta were good but for the tiramisu  i was a bit disappointed as the texture and the taste was not authentic italian tiramisu  it was not a fresh one  like there was a jelly in it to make it last longer all in all it was great thank you, good quality italian food spaghetti are rightly prepared following traditional recipes without usual foreign arrangements fish soup was excellent bruschetta not over the top good service although a bit below a 100 euro each dinner anyway a good dinner experience, have eaten at a number of pizza restaurants in beijing and this one was as good as any location is a bit off the beaten path and the restaurant feels a little like a coffee shop however pizza was thin cust with a tasty tomato sauce and the one pasta we tried was perfectly cooked and obviously made in house wine selection is somewhat limited and a number of the bottles on the list were not available overall a good dining experience a great place to come with friends but probably not a place to take business clients on a different note our server caroline was amazing very friendly and attentive she spoke perfect english and was as engaging as any server in a good restaurant in the us, tripadvisor reviews led my wife and three children here for dinner weve been eating chinese cuisine for the entire vacation so decided to treat the family with a nice and quiet dining experience this restaurant delivered everything we needed on that night

it was chic and fancy but yet inviting and comfortable the background music was relaxing staff were polite and attentive the food well the result spoke for themselves we ordered garlic bread spaghetti bolognese ravioli linguine cabonara  2 pizzas gelatos and fondant and nothing went to waste the glass of italian red wine complimented the meals the price was very reasonable

the conversation on the table with three children suddenly turned sophisticated and civilised during the night thank you fratelli fresh , my brother and i had a fantastic evening last night chez fratelli

the carbonara and pizza were delicious nothing was rushed which is nice as it enhances the entire experience

the real highlight was the legendary brian as he made dealing with stefano bearable okay okay just kidding they were both great conversationalists who played off each other perfectly we were impressed they could keep up with our banter

we definitely recommend fratelli to others thank you brian and stefano

the service was compentent and they had an excellent choice of wines
if you are staying beijing downtown it might take about 30min by cab to get there but it worth the ride
i defenitely reccoment this restaurant, we went here as part of restaurant week

amazing experience from the first to the last minute

great friendly and informative staff attentive but not overwhelming

we were sat near the kitchen which added great atmosphere to our meal it was great to see all of the hard work and dedication happening and to experience the thrill of the kitchen

starter scallops simply divine soft and tender the balsamic vinegar was the best i�ve ever tasted a fresh crisp clean tasting salad

rissotto cooked to perfection veal which had a slight smokiness to � i usually shove my food down my mouth as quickly as i can but the food was so good it made me slow down and savour every last mouthful

the dessert was simply outstanding

generous portions but not too much

the staff were great as mentioned it was a great touch when the chef came round during each of our courses to see if we were enjoying the food he was clearly passionate and dedicated to his craft

the restaurant was large and well equipped but maintained a personal intimate ambience

��, this restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel and we liked it so much we returned for a 2nd night before we left beijing the duck was delicious  crispy and succulent we also tried a range of other dishes which we mostly loved particularly the sweet and sour options they offered no wine so we drank beer with

��, offer very good service and good food price is reasonable the beijing roasted duck is excellent and good price many other good foods must go, very busy on the tourist route no wine available only beer etc food was good  selected by our guide we had chicken with peanuts vegetables  rice more than we could eat, a nice restaurant food and service were good excellent value for money try the fish in sour soup the quantities are surprisingly large","fastfood",0.504018858324887

��, the falafel dalbhat mushroom burger home fries and ajvar were all nice the kitchen tends to close rather early an hour before closing time on occasions thus best to go early in the evening, we were oil  msged out by the time we found this place so the healthy meals were very appreciated we had the meze platter with bread which was delicious we then had a southwest burger which was also delcious but only came with 5 french fries haha i had the chocolate cake for dessert which was great good atmosphere
��, theres a good range of food the service is friendly and the whole place has a great karmically clean feel to it has the added bonus of being located in a wonderful hutong close to the subway with some interesting quality shops and cafes, my second visit to this cafe was unfortunately not as good as the first one due partly to both the staff and the food the female member of staff made us feel like we were a bit if a nuisance to be eating in the cafe to be honest and was not friendly at all male staff though  lovely

��, came there at busy lunchtime on a saturday got table immediately attentive waiters eating here is a total experience since there is this traditional way in which you have to build up your little pancakes with the duck slices greeneries and soy sauce and close them with your chop sticks service was good and dishes were brought and cleared away

��, my chinese friends say there is beijing duck and then there is quanjude duck and you should take the second this is a chain that specialises in duck beijing style and if you want to have duck it is the place to go there are several branches the quality is the same and this one is my choice the one
��, ive been to many other roast duck reastaurants and this one was the worst by far the crockery on the tables was old and scretched the waiter was completely disinterested and refused to take orders because it was too much the duck we ordered was slightly under average  the price clearly over we also had chicken with walnuts and
��, the duck was fine but there was trash in the restaurant and in the toilet the service was ok the duck was sliced out in the hall and we had to ask that the chef moved so we could see the show but it was still hard to see it seemed like the duck had been prepared ahead of time
��, i recently had a banquet dinner at the quanjude roast duck restaurant the food was excellent and the service was wonderful the other dishes were also well prepared i highly recommend eating at any of the quanjude roast duck restaurants around beijing on a visit it will give you the local experience of eating a beijing delicacy, the chef puts on a show slicing the duck into over 100 pieces in front of the diners not my first time visiting the restaurant serves consistently delicious roast duck which appeals to both chinese and foreign diners, this was the first time to eat roasted duck in beijing the service was good we didnt had to wait to long the duck and the other food we ordered was very tasteful be aware of the 10 service charge, i have been a big fun of peking roast duck and have been to this location a couple of times each time it gets worse and the highlight of the mean the duck gets fatty and oily with a strange and awful taste it actually got me sick this time i will never go to this location and in fact

��, the bon vivant gourmets recently visited this restaurant with locals it is the original imperial peking duck with a fascinating history this particular location was selected by the chinese premier enlai for its proximity to the central government the recipe comes from a chef from the imperial court and the open hanging ovens were designed by the founder of quanjude
��, 5th visit feel qualified to finally call it this is the place to go for duck in beijing indeed the world other dishes are good but really youre here for one thing the duck they have a new flower arraignment for the duck that theyre very proud of it does look almost as good as it tastes no trip to
��, this place is famous for its peking ducking is a 100 year old brand they have a few branches in
��, the duck was great even better is that you are eating peking duck at arguably the best roast duck restaurant in peking closes quite early, if you go to beijing you must try peking duck and so i did quanjade is a very popular restaurant with its peking duck and to me it seems a bit touristy i am not sure if the local will patron this restaurant as most of them waiting for the seats were tourists from oversea or outside of beijing after
��, when in beijing i suggest you try at least one restaurant that serves authentic peking duck this restaurant specialty is peking duck they also serves a full meal laureat  peking duck is served with a wrap peking duck whose skin is crispy and sliced with its meat hoisin sauce the bone is also made into soup all in all
��, this place was recommended by several people from beijing and the duck was delicious a bit expensive but worth it in my opinion loved every bite, i would say it pays to eat a set of duck cuisine for usd$60 per person here but i would not say it is the best duck cuisine in the world staff are skindeeply polite and somewhat a little bit impatient and the restaurant is very crowded noisy, having read some other reviews i think its worth noting that quanjudes beijing duck is different to the cantonese style peking duck that many people may be more familiar with indeed as an australian cantonese style peking duck is what 95 of restaurants serve in australia  distinguished by the roasted duck skin being typically juicier and sliced shallowly so
��, been to others and given its price i expected more unfortunately it was way below expectation the skin was too fat and didnt have much condiments to go with the wrapping i suggest to go sijinminfu instead, came there at busy lunchtime on a saturday got table immediately attentive waiters food was excellent traditional sauces etc were added when we exhausted the supply highly recommend, eating here is a total experience since there is this traditional way in which you have to build up your
��, ive eaten peking duck before in singapore and i find that the peking duck in beijing was way too greasy for me i didnt like the thick layer of fats behind the crispy skin it was however very entertaining to watch the chef slice up the duck in front of you the soup which they made from the leftover duck
��, i dont even want to write down any reviews for this since it was really not a nice lunch at all since there were a lots people and all noon tickets sold out so we had to go to the quanjude fast food session to eat sit with different people i didnt really mind but the set meal we ordered
��, the food served here was terrible from the shopfront  it really look impressive however when the dishes arrived  it was everything but bad the duck was not so good as recommended the vegetables served were cold and the soup was tasteless, i have read the negative reviews here about quan jade  it does not reflect the experience we had at all dont listen to these westerners bagging the food service line ot the front etcim a true blue aussie  westerner too but the chinese people dont operate the way we do in western society i love how straight forward

��, a very busy restaurant on a pedestrianized shopping street ducks are carved individually at each table best not too eat too much of the plentiful and tasty other dishes before your duck arrives the crispy skin is excellent and the whole dish is far removed from some grease laden imitations served in the uk, 4th time here the quality is always the same the duck skin is crispy and very oily somes love it the vegetable dishes are very nice the only bad part is that the bones can only be made into a soup which tastes really horrible, travelling as part of a tour group we visited the quanjude duck restaurant for our last evening in beijing don�t be fooled into thinking this is a one off restaurant it is a commercial chain however that said we had a very good buffet in which food appeared dish after dish and the duck was plentiful we paid for an

15,"weekend lunch with a group of friends
overall a 4 star version of the fine dining trb  this is more like a bistro
menu concept and dishes very similar to trb but lacking the finesse and quality
we noticed an expat restaurant manager there who spent all his time in front of the kitchen counter chatting away with his colleagues rather than taking care of the guest and service
overall below average  not to be repeated, went here for a wine brunch that was provided by le sommelier and it was excellent pairing were spot on it was actually a crystal clear blue sky day in beijing so the views were excellent

great staff wine and service would recommend going at night because thats when all the lights are on and everything is lite up also during the day parking was a problem as its right next to a tourist attraction, decided to go there with my fiancee under the recommendation of a friend we were blown away from the beginning til the end many options for the food between 34 courses or tasting menu
the food was well presented and very tasty
what amazed me its the service everything was more than perfect every little details explanation of the dishes they are working with their heart and not like machine
thank you so much for the lovely evening and hope to come back soon, trb bites is trbs take on easy and relaxed dining here every 23 weeks
location
the location is superb every time i have friends visiting from out of beijing this is the place to go its directly located next to the float in front of the east gate of the forbidden city
food
i do like the food here mainly western focus with a few tailored chineseish dishes make you own menu type of ordering  same as trb fixed price for x amount of dishes the amountquality of the free bitespalate cleansers between dishes tend to vary according to the how busy the location is and the time of the day you are there ie last time i was there for an early morning brunch they only wiped up only 2 very simple bitesslightly disappointed
environmentservice
if you go there as it was intended for a casual open but also slightly refined meal you wont be disappointed for informal meetings with friends this is great service is slightly lacking when it gets busy you get a slight feeling of it being just a little understaffed when the place is full so you might have to stand up and signal to someone when needed but the response time is adequate dont expect all the service of fine dining but then again if thats want you have to go their fine dining restaurant trb this is a place where you can relax and chat up with friends all the while with a fantastic view of the forbidden city for me although it has its downsides but the location + foodservice combination until now is unbeatable for first time visitors to beijing its worth a try but be sure to reserve in advance, my husband and i went for our anniversary we have been to trb before and wanted to try bites the service and food is just as amazing as trb we had a lovely evening of cocktails and all the many little one bite appetizers, we took my sister here for her birthday as she was visiting from canada the trb staff were extremely helpful in making this experience memorable right from reservations to the end of brunch it was the highlight of my sisters trip since the restaurant is right beside forbidden city with nice views of it you may want to pair this with a visit there if visiting beijing, i went to trb bites with a group of friends during beijing restaurant week we ate from a set menu each course was excellent the ingredients were fresh and the dishes complimented each other extremely well the staff are excellent they are bilingual and very attentive which is definitely not the norm in beijing if you are local for somewhere to spend a specially occasion this would be an excellent choice, service certainly friendly and efficient the food was not up to what i would have expected i understand the concept of bite food but somehow didnt capture my liking
i will go back, had a enjoyable lunch at bites with my missus
situated outside the east gate of the forbidden city the 4 course lunch was delightful from soup to dessert especially loved the octopus n the beef cheek dishes service was excellent we didnt hv long breaks in between dishes which is the way we like to be served others might like a slower pace extras like welcome drinks n red wine were served nice touch for first timers like us with chocolate dessert n a photo of us at bites a definite dining place for us whenever we are in beijing again, a devine lunch beautifully presented delivered by knowledgeable servers in a stunning historic setting, located close to the east gate of the forbidden city with a view of the wall this is a gem for foodies the exciting presentation of the complimentary bits the flavor the tastes and smells made each dish a culinary adventure defiantly a winner, brilliant atmosphere super service and the best food i have had in a while your team did a fab job keep it up guys and see you guys real soon again

ask for stephen and for his recommendation to plan your meal he did for us 3 diners and we were amazed food portion is just right with molecular infusion and creating presentations the taste is brilliant too they even clicked our picture sent us thank you email and gave a farewell gift

thank you and happy new year, first of all i�d like to say that the temple restaurant trb has been our favorite restaurant in beijing for some time now and we were asked to try the trb bites which promises to have a more casual approach to fine dining my husband and i have a 3 month old baby so we were first a bit hesitant to go to fancy restaurants in general but after all we figured if we wanted to continue our fine dining experiences than this might be just the spot for us



after we arrived at the restaurant we were welcomed by peter the assistant director of operation and he seated us at a great table with a temple view the look and style of the restaurant was different from the trb � the seats and the open kitchen had an inviting touch upstairs there is a separate room in which the restaurant is able to hold special events like business dinners etc



you could tell from the menu that the elements of the trb very similar to the trb bites but the dishes still all sounded different we first got served some small bites of interesting and new tastes really creative creations i really liked the cucumber pastille it tasted like a handful of fresh and cold cucumber salad



after that we tried a lot of different dished and a tasteful surprise that went really well with my husband�s champagne was the duck egg custard we have never eaten it before and we loved it



the next dish my husband tried was thailike redcurry dish �pawn� which was paired by the restaurants� recommendation with the jm boillot domaine les roques blanc 2013 which had an apricot finish to it that went amazingly well with the gently sweet finish of the pawn dish for my husband this combination was truly genius and is now one of his alltime favorite foodwine combos of all time i got scallops which were spot on perfectly cooked and fresh

among some other dishes we were also served the bone marrow dish which neither of us have ever seen before and tasted exceptional

a beef cheek came as a final meat course to complete our surf  turf experience it was soft tasty and we simply loved it as dessert i had a fruit cake and a chocolate mousse cake very thick and rich in chocolate my husband had a white chocolate mousse which he loved



there is two people in particular that made our dining experience one of the best we had in beijing so far peter teng who took care of us the whole evening  and who really helped us out wherever he could when we had some difficulties with our baby also the chef sebastian schaefer whos food and wine recommendations really brilliant and i think with the menu he was really able to distinguish the restaurants food from the trb it was exceptional and perfect service all the other service staff was very friendly and attentive



summary of the evening excellent service like at trb itself creative and delicious more casual than the trb so its absolutely suitable for visiting with a baby or children while still having the fine dining experience trb bites is definitely an alternative to trb you have the great service and comparable excellent food and the prices of the trb bites are a bit lower going hand in hand with the more casual style, we returned to beijing to celebrate our 10th anniversary at the same most beautiful venue just opposite to the east gate of the forbidden city �the courtyard� where we met 15 years ago the place is now the trb bites restaurant
we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly hospitality and the delicious food when the stuff realized the reason of our celebration we were overwhelmed by various tasty treats �on the house� the chef sebastian schafer came to see us and our fantastic waiter mr dee lesmana took so good care of us that it made our celebration really unforgettable we spent wonderfull evening in the trb bitesfor sure we shall returnhighly recommend 5 star plus, trb is the best restaurant in town with refined french cuisine excellent food perfect service friendly and extremely polite and discrete staff you can also make your own menu with winepairing for the price you want to pay really nice atmosphere in an old mansion close to the forbidden city, culinary art composes by a welltraveled german chef in a great ambience i was brought here for my birthday  and it was a great gift the menu leaves nothing to be desired the service is perfect the location is a pleasure  especially the open kitchen the views of the live preparation expressly admits a clear recommendation for all beijing and visitors to the city, love the new lollipop style snacks and the bread i always looking forward for the team new menu and creativity thank you for the welcome drink and the chocolate cake really recommend everyone to try their egg yummy, what a great vibe very classy and upscale right outside be forbidden city
the food was great the service was incredible  definitely go here we loved it, we are a family of five and came here for dinner our first night in beijing they rolled out the red carpet for us and we had the most amazing meal and service the ambiance was hip and the food was inventive and delicious even though we ordered the three course meal they treated us to many extras we highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely come here again, the view is amazing the staff adorable the food is awesome and they have many delicious surprises for us dee took care of us and was a perfect manager everyone in this place is lovely it was the only restaurant that we went twice, we received a very warm welcome to cold beijing with an amazing brunch artsy presentation professional service great attention to the smallest details turned our first lunch in beijing into a lovely culinary experience highly recommended, we came here after seeing the great reviews on trip advisor it was our first meal in beijing and it was by far one of the best experiences i have every had at a restaurant the staff is so nice and attentive they even asked if we wanted to change tables in order to sit by the window for a premier view of the forbidden city how thoughtful
this restaurant is practically connected to the forbidden city along the river giving a very authentic feel
now about the food the idea is simple you decide how your menu looks you have a choice of 3 or 4 courses the choices are broken up into three categories fresh tender and savory i chose the scallops amazing the salmon delicious with the sauces on the plate and the beef must get 3 courses for 298 rmb this is such a deal the chef is european but worked in thailand so there is a wonderful southeast asian ting to the plates
long story short if visiting beijing go to trb bites, world class service and food experience
i found this place through trip advisor after my 45 hours strolled in the forbidden city the place just at the side of the east gate of the forbidden city and the river that surround the palace

i was very lucky that dee greeted and ushered me to the table just next to the window with the view of the river

i like how the amouse bouche with cucumber woke up my palate to start the 3 course meal and my choice of chocolate cherry dessert to end the meal

as a solo traveller i received so many surprises during my lunch meal from the local sparkling wine to the chocolate cake beside what i ordered as the dessert
thank you for such hospitality that made me feeling like a regular customer of trb instead of just the tourist especially to you dee, our first time in trb bites was a sunday we tried the brunch
it was a nice moment with a great freedom given to the customers to elaborate their menu according to their own taste brunch comes with danish pastries muffins an excellent italian style bread jams and pate

service was a bit slow but both restaurant managers are very professional ensuring every customer satisfaction

dishes served are excellent original and never pretentious

cheese plater came without butter this is a bit surprising especially knowing that the waitress we asked for butter in english and chinese was not able to understand our request as she brought a kind of pate

i recommend to choose a table upstairs its smaller and brighter sometimes the noise was a bit loud despite the fact only 8 tables are concentrated on this small area its certainly due to construction issues

reservation is better as only few tables are near a window facing one of the wall of the forbidden city an amazing and unique restaurant location

as we were driving we tried the valetparking provided by trb bites but we had to wait for quite a long time inside our car near the forbidden city police started to question us it was a bit embarrassing we also were surprised that no ticket or voucher was given to us when the valet came to pick up the car this aspect should be reviewed by the management

we sometimes have dinner to temple restaurant in beijing the mother company of trb bites and it was nice to feel the same attention to customers, trb bites is tucked in one corner along an alley next to the forbidden city after dining chinese and peking ducks in past 2 days  this is a gem and a pleasant surprise serving european in beijing brunch comprise 4 course from any of 6 categories appetiser  eggs  seafood  beefchicken pasta  dessert service staff are friendly and peter manager is attentive to diners needs food is good and the kitchen does bring out a few suprises, trb bites is an inspiring experiment in bringing european haute cuisine within the historical heart of china the restaurant is situated just a stone�s throw to the east gate of the forbidden city and some tables on the 1st and 2nd floor have an unspoiled view over the moat of the gate despite this important setting the atmosphere is elegant but informal the staff is international and extremely courteous we can assure you that there is no better service throughout beijing especially the manager evan is doing everything to make you feel at home and the evening a special event the food is excellent and the management keeps the menu intriguing by organising various gastronomic collaborations both from europe and asia we heartily recommend trb bites our visits as a couple and with friends have always been an enjoyable and delicious experience, german chef sebastian schafer pampered us with a superb presented array of brunch dishes western food asian infused it was a true treat, its been so many changes since my first visit  the price is higher than before but the its worth well  the food really amazing although the the octopus not more in the menuthe little surprise dishes is working and my family really enjoy it, i try to avoid giving poor reviews but i feel that as i have given trb a good write up in the past i should revise this after two poor experiences one visit was in april or may this year and i thought it might be a one off one was this month very very poor service both times friendly yes but just not competent the staff were attentive but just not skilled enough nor were they being adequately managed  forgetting to bring out a whole course on a fixed four course menu takes some doing i could almost forgive even this is the food was excellent but alas it was tired by the time it was delivered to the table and i was left very very underwhelmed, we visited the place expecting asa good food as in trb the quality is not as good the price is also not the same but in my opinion this one is not value for money the food being ok the atmosphere is so noisy you cant almost talk with the people at your table you can get places with this quality and better prices in many other areas in beijing, we had heard wonderful things about trb bites and finally had a chance to go there for a late anniversary dinner we were not disappointed it was not crowded at all because of the national day holiday we had an excellent table with a very nice view of the forbidden city everything and i mean everything was absolutely delicious the presentation is spectacular and the mixture of flavors in indescribable and to top it the service was unusually good for beijing as for the dishes they were all extremely delicious my daughter enjoyed the octopus very much and i would certainly also recommend the steaks since it was an anniversary celebration they treated us with complimentary champagne and also a cake which im not sure they always do but it was very uncrowded due to the holiday it is not a very formal restaurant but i would describe the experience as being one of the best dinner experiences ive had in beijing and ive had thousands in beijing over several decades, summer cocktail very crisp and refreshing impressive surroundings nice view of the forbidden city walls though cleanliness of the bathrooms could be improved food was superb with the sole exception of slightly overcooked lamb  but the kitchen comped a small dessert sampler which more than made up for it would definitely go back again, just amazingthey were so nice to take care of my vegetarian needsthey even went out to get stuff to make my veggie courseextremely courteous and fantastic quality of food

abby cindy and their head steward were just awesome, the day i visited trb bites that i was sick and had a bad feeling of my throat the manager dee served us very decently and keep my water filled all the time food here was refined and sight was good the average cost for lunch is about $40usdollar per person including tax and tips i will give an overall 95 out of 10 to this small restaurant i find it has the best service around the same price range restaurant in beijing recommend, i had dinner tonight with 3 colleagues we are all in the hospitality industry we read a review of this restaurant and decided to try it wary at first as we are new to the city and unsure of the location

the food and the staff could not be faulted cindy out hostess was fantastic the food presentation and the taste was comparable to any fine dining restaurant i have been too the meal was excellently priced as was the drink

on my next trip i will definitely return, this is the casual version of the trb which offers the same quality of food as trb service is great under the supervision of ignace the manager lovely outdoor dining option in the small courtyard or the terrace, we came here for restaurant week and ate a set course for 250rmb everything was brilliantly presented and tasted great nice casual atmosphere too only issue i had was that they served fake cavier having asked the waiter he assured me that it was real the menu didnt hide that it was avruga cavier which is a brand of caviar substitute but the mark up in price for the dish and the waitor saying it is real makes me think they want to steer you into thinking it was real one mistake wouldnt stop me going again as the food really is brilliant berny from bernyeatstheworld, choose from 34 courses of creative food the gazpacho was great as was the octopus the cod and flank steak were perfect great presentation  great service, this little gem is located a few minutes away from the east exit of the forbidden city we were looking for a nice place t have lunch but bites really exceeded our expectations
the ambience is elegant but yet approachable we were greeted with a smile and even though we had no reservation the manager offered us a nice table
the menu is a fusion of high end gourmet french cuisine with a touch of amazing local flavours fois gras ice cream anyone the flavours were a great break from the traditional chinese cuisine that we were having on a daily basis
but most importantly visit this place for the amazing service the place is sparkling clean the ambience is cool with view to the forbidden city walls many thanks to dee and the rest of the bites team that demonstrated what true hospitality truly is, having tried trb the mothership and been very impressed i was intrigued by their new restaurant stunning setting literally on the doorstep of the forbidden city and the service and food matches we got extra amuse bouche because my friend was late free sparkling wine and a complimentary dessert what more can you ask for the new indonesian floor manager could do no wrong helping us with a taxi and committed all the way well done team, bites is yet again a successful offering by the trb ownership the service is first rate as expected the wines very good loved the albarino the new menu highlights some nice healthy fair like baby carrots and qinoa overall excellent a must dine destination the cod with coconut ice creamred curry~one word�amazing

lamb with pureeed eggplant with a charred taste�wow

the dessert mangococonut with rice cake truly a melange of flavors, we had finished a long day exploring the forbidden city the service was great food as tasty as any ive had and the manager spoke english very well definite recommendation for travellers to beijing, this was my 2nd time at bites after they have opened

a few details have changed giving it a more casual feel first one that comes to your eyes is the fact of not having table cloth anymore

in terms of food this restaurant has made a great progress with the new chef very good food yet simple but well done with a twist here and there

the amouse bouch selection was good to start bread was broughtperfectly baked i have to say

my first and favorite dish of the night was cauliflower basically all the food on that dish is based on cauliflower vegetable you can taste different textured food with cauliflower based components for instance cauliflower dish was composed of cauliflower mousse cauliflower puree cold cauliflower in a sort of meringue shape with a twist of sweetness probably white choc cauliflower carpaccio and caviar all together gives a great fresh yet very well done dish

quinoa salad was also very good this is a good example of what bites can be salad a simple dish yet very well done all veg fresh good seasoning simple dressing with a touch of sweetness all together very well balanced

octopus with chorizo and puree was equally well done specially when paired with the great chorizo sauce present on that dish

cod fish with coconut was very good and to finish lamb was also very good

congratulations to the new chef to cook very good food without inventing too much with very taste it seems that bites has found an identity when it comes to food served, i cant praise trb  trb bites enough we went in for a cocktail after having an unforgettable experience at their main trb restaurant a few nights prior and it will blow you away at bites you are surprised and delighted at every moment fantastic cocktails delicious surprises await this is a place where its all about your experience both for you and your mouth you wont be disappointed, not what i expected of beijing at all  amazing meal

had the 4 course set menu and every course was amazing as was the service

staff couldnt do enough for us and was greeted at the table with a free glass of fizz and nibbles  will definatly be back when next in beijing, was wowed in the first 20 min but left dissappointed loved the complimentary champagne and the bread basket filled with delicious pastries and refilled to out delight

but when the courses started coming cold and after long delays the glitter started to dull started noticing all the errors the staff were making with our table and others and the confusion all over the dining room watched our meals cool 2 feet away from us waiting for servers to appear after interminable waits for our courses to come we sighed a breath of relief when dessert arrived and we could finally leave

$60 cad for 3 small but filling courses and $20 for a bottle of water 

the food was beautifully presented but cold and short of delicious

overall a wonderfully surprising and pampered meal unfortunately tarnished but inexperienced staff, we tried trb previously and thought about treating ourselves to an afternoon tea before heading home  what a great choice the location is phenomenal and the food well what can i say beautifully presented tasty who can go past freshly baked scones and fillingwe could barely move it was a fantastic way to spend out last afternoon in beijing and the service was impeccable attentive and considerate the service was above and beyond what was expected the owner spoke with us and wished us well on our departure  this has never happened to us before the afternoon tea is a must for anyone looking for a sweet and savory treat with amazing views, my colleague and i found this restaurant by accident back in march i forgot to write the review then because we were on a hectic business trip and we managed to come back twice in two days this restaurant is an absolute treat  the food is spectacular very beautifully served fresh and tasty the presentation and service were impeccable i wouldnt know what i loved most the amazing beef the deconstructed cheese cake the scallops  all wonderful

a particular mention should go to the manager evan horsman who has been so welcoming and wonderful to us spoiling us with attentions amusebouches and other little things as well as his lovely company we cant wait to be back in november

the price is unbeatable <u+00a3>4050 for one of the best meals of my life, im a huge fan of the original trb and had been meaning to try bites for a while i went with a friend this past weekend because i saw that bites has a freeflow drinks deal and we wanted a funrelaxingboozy brunch it turned out to be the complete opposite

we sat upstairs and things werent off to a great start both my friend and i had dead bugs in the bottoms of our empty champagne glasses to our surprise the server wasnt apologetic at all but whatever there were a few other very small things that were off the moist towelettes were stained the menu was grimy that sort of thing nothing worth complaining about but definitely a step down from trbs perfection

we each picked 5 courses and ordered the two hour freeflow drinks my friend and i speak some chinese which is good because the servers english was really limited the food began to arrive and it was really really good the duck egg and octopus dishes in particular made me want to lick the plate but still no drinks the servers didnt check in on us and seemed stressed out when we did see them i heard the male server snap at the female server a few times which didnt make for a super pleasant atmosphere

we finally ask about our drinks and are told that theyre coming soon a moment later the server brings out a bottle of champagne we start to get excited until its given to another table the server was carefully avoiding eye contact with us at this point very odd

another hour passes the upstairs is a tiny space and there were two servers dealing with four tables but it was ridiculously difficult to get their attention and they constantly disappeared finally two hours after we ordered the male server finally comes over and tries to explain the problem with the drinks i speak ok chinese but couldnt quite understand what he was saying he offered us a glass of free champagne which we accepted but of course it was the end of the bottle so it was pretty flat and my friend only got half a glass at that point it was just funny

and to top it off we only received four out of the five courses we ordered again we spent a lot of time trying to get the attention of the servers who finally told us they thought we had ordered four but to be honest we were relieved because were so excited to leave

in sum the service was comically bad to the point where it distracted from an otherwise delicious meal its not just that it wasnt up to trb standards it was literally the worstweirdest service ive ever had in my life the cumulative issues and the complete lack of communication was absurd i do wonder if it was just dysfunction with the upstairs team but i dont think ill be back to try the downstairs skip bites and stick with the original trb, i went there with 2 colleagues for the first time
the location is great the service is young and very professional
but most of all i love the idea of small bites very tasty and to choose several of them at reasonable price

��, the attitude toward dumplings in this place is best summarized by a line on a wall poster inside  dumplings are considered to be most delicious food in beijing theyre not wrong and the dumplings here were fantastic we had pork  water chestnut our fave pork  chives and beef  fennel but there was a wide variety ~50
��, they offer many types of dumplings and my family sampled several the dumplings were just okay the waiter was extremely friendly and didnt speak english but their menu is in english so you can point to the dishes you want to order we dined on a sunday evening around 8 pm and the restaurant was nearly empty no waiting, a friend and are stumbled on nuige jiaozi niuge chaotzu walking back to our hostel and thought wed give it

��, our first meal in beijing and it was outstanding our family of 4 had four orders of dumplingsspicy beef pork and water chestnut chicken and mushroom and beef and corn all were devoured, we went here on the strength of the reviews and were hoping for a nice meal as the previous day we had a bad experience elsewhere have to say you cant beat fresh dumplings so if you are close by its worth dropping in, a wide spectrum of dumpling fillings some of which were quite novelty however because the lady behind the open kitchen makes the dumplings only after your order them it can take a while until you get your orders 10 dumplings per order  we had three plates between the three of us decor and cleanliness leaves much room for improvement
��, wir haben hier zweimal gegessen die dumplings werden nach der bestellung frisch zubereitet was man durch ein fenster beobachten kann
��, stopped here simply because we were hungry didnt read any reviews before we were met by incredibly friendly staff and and very healthy portions of dumplings all of which were delicious the shrimp ones were something else though they were simply the best dumplings ive ever had lovely unpretentious wee restaurant recommended, if not for tripadvisor we would have walked by as it was quiet inside when we went but so glad we didnt the menu is in english and chinese we ordered dumplings 3 between 2 people beware each order of dumplings has 10 pieces so we would have been fine with just 2 the dumplings were fantastic you can watch

��, fantastic dumplings made fresh to order good price and variety and also an english menu a plate of 10 dumplings ranges in price from 1848rmb and about 23 plates per guest should be enough for a good dinner large bottle of beer was 15rmb can of coke was 5rmb, we come here with our kids and we all love the dumplings but there is other food which is very tasty aswell eg gong bao ji ding and the vegetables are very good i hate to pay the overpriced restaurants for not really delicious food here it is the other way round great food and really cheap prices, great place for all dumpling lovers they have dumpling with everything  literally everything great place to sit relax and eat , we read the other reviews and decided to check out this place not much to look at from the outside but the dumplings are very good duck beef chicken pork seafood and more on the menu even donkey  we werent bold enough for the latter but i highly recommend the kung pao chicken dumplings so good i ordered a

16,"this is a very nice restaurant pulling out all the stops on classic peking cuisine and roasting the ducks right in the middle of the restaurant

obviously the peking roast duck pancakes were fantastic but so too was the fried squirrel fish in mandarin sauce ive never had anything like it but it was a beautiful fish both to look at and to eat

prices are very reasonable and the service is attentive but only if you speak chinese we arrived before our hosts and spent an uncomfortable fifteen minutes being ignored by staff too scared to try and speak to us not a problem just the reality of nontourist places in china

all up a very good chinese dining experience and ill definitely be back, i went with some friends due to a hotel recommendation it totally changed my opinion on chinese food food was great loved the filled tomatoes the dumplings and the duck very reasonable priced for what you get nice decoration no english with the staff but this is pretty the norm in beijing , a must to try for roast duck and the dish will come with complimentary soup another dish to experience is the pork ribs it comes with a poem and sprinkle of snow flakes when the dish arrives, wow amazing food great restaurant and incredible location the pekin duck was the best of my entire trip but also wine and desserts

the only problem is the language  nobody but just one employee speaks a little english even ask for sparkling water was a funny situation

1010 highly recommended, roasted to order and delicious d dong now has two sizes a smaller duck perfect for two rather than a half large duck crispy not greasy and carved at your table all you need is two more dishes from their complete menu some rice and a glass of wine and there you have a memorable meal service was warm and helpful with english no problem setting is modern with proper table settings a dining experience to enjoy, the restaurant was nice  the staff doesnt speak much english but you can manage with the picture of the food  the duck was very good great taste  definitely would recommend the place , the duck was delicious the place we didnt like a lot because it was hot and too full we also had noodles and rice and were all amazing the restaurant is beautiful and every dish is a work of art and delicious of course the masterpiece was the duck which is a must when visiting china, travelled to beijing for a few short days whilst in china and had a local driver to take us to our accommodation and also the great wall he recommended this place to us and it did not disappoint huge restaurant and so much duck it was melt in your mouth and a great atmosphere would highly recommend to anyone travelling close to this area, great service the staff showed me how to eat the duck by wrapping it in a crepe which they call a pancake i speak enough mandarin to be dangeous, my sister had read the reviews and determined that this would be a dinner stop for us we arrived at the restaurant at 530pm just after seeing an acrobat show the restaurant was fairly empty but the hostess showed us a paper that said we had to be done but 630pm im guessing they were expecting a full house based upon reservations our server did not speak english but made every effort to help us make good selections we knew we wanted the duckwhy else would you go there he suggested a side dish that was so good not sure what it was called but it was very good it was a dish of sauteed greens with garlic and butter it was very tasty while it was wilted it was still crisp in my opinion it was cooked perfectly they brought out our duck and watching the chef slice and plate it was a treat be sure to order the condiments another server who spoke some english gave us a demonstration on how to eat the duck everything about it was superb after our meal we were presented with some fresh mandarin oranges that were so sweeta great palate cleanser and for all this we paid $66us including 2 beers we had read that this place was pricey the atmosphere suggested the same the service would justify a higher price tag but that was not the case we had an excellent meal a true beijing foodie experience and all for what we felt was extremely reasonable oh and we walked out of the restaurant at 630pm without ever feeling rushed dont miss this one, i went two times to da dong and i can recommend the branch in sanlitun since the atmosphere is very nice the beijing duck is delicious and the other dishes are very good as well overall i will definitely go there next time as well even though it is quite expensive, the duck is superlative so ill move on to the other meals the menu is quite extensive theyre all amazing from fried rice to braised beef each dish has such bold yet complex flavours that theyre unlike any other chinese restaurant ive been to you really cant go wrong

the service is great and because its peking duck you wont have to wait long at all we also received free lanterns because it was chinese new year

importantly its much cheaper than youd expect for such a highclass restaurant, i went to this place for dinner along with my other colleagues including locals after our training session now im a indian vegetarian little did my colleagues knew prior so they ordered a lot of meat including the famous peking duck soon i was enjoying some salads and tried some of the deserts not very sweet though the overall ambiance was quite good not sure if they have many veg dishes it was a good experience staff was courteous, my husband had been at this restaurant before with a customer and he took me here while we were in beijing last november service was slow at first but once it got started they were great the peking duck was absolutely spectacular the server gives you a demonstration on how to add sugar to the duck skin my favorite and which sauces to use you wont be disappointed, da dong is the place the hotel sends westerners when they want to have peking duck in beijing da dong is a good choice but their are better places that are less expensive when you are with the locals the only knock on this place is that the service was so so, in the summer of 2015 on our trip to china my family and i went to the da dong roast duck restaurant during our short stay in beijing it was recommended by our travel agency this very modern restaurant located above a shopping mall is totally unexpected while walking through the neighbourhoods of beijing the restaurant emits quality and hygiene which is not obvious in china the food itself was absolutely scrumptious we all went for the duck on the menu because you can�t go to beijing without having the famous peking duck it was well cooked and delightful although the service wasn�t very good we had to ask several times for drinks and we had to be very patient to getting our food even though the restaurant wasnt very busy
i would highly recommend it to others although you have to keep in mind that the food is pretty expensive, so this place is right next to a multi floor shopping mall where we wandered around lost for a good half an hour go outside of the mall and take the elevator up
that said great food we all had the duck of course they cook it in giant open flame ovens that you can see
the restaurant itself is beautiful and modern, great place duck was well prepared and served with excellence we had a great time with our family, the peking duck was good but expensive could have the same at other restaurants at lower prices the rest of food was also very expensive hence if you are looking for value for money food better avoid it, we were recommended toe da dong restaurant in wanfujing street and the reviews on tripadvisor were accurate
we had to queue for about 30 minutes at 1930 and this is normal unless you have a reservation we had been told that the restaurant did not accept reservations after 1830 but that doesnt seem to be correct

we had half a superlean peking duck 288 yuan for a full duck and some prawns between 2 people certainly enough food the beers were cheap at 30 yuan for 2 but the tea was 128 yuan for a pot which is pricey

the duck was delicious and better than anything i have had elsewhere
total cost about 450 yuan for 2 people would certainly recommend highly, best roast duck in china the ambiance is great service wonderful its better to get there early have a drink while waiting for your table naturallyorder the duck and enjoy a fantastic culinary experience, went to the jingfujie outlet on a weekday dinner ordered duck steamed fish and asparagus duck was only moderately crispy and had pretty tough flesh rather disappointing considering this is one of the best places for peking duck steamed fish and veg were great though price is extremely expensive and the duck is probably one of cheaper items, i try this famous roast duck restaurant for my dinner and expected to wait for sometimes as it was quite crowdedit was good with a little smell of firewood something unusual but the skin does not melt in the mouthyou have to take the lift from outside the building on the right side facing the main entrance, staff feels a bit stuck up duck was the crispiest but thats all duck liver was good like pate nothing else impresses, if you are in beijing and must try peking duck this will be a good place to eat the ambience is nice but note that it is on the pricier side the menu is really filled with choices to spoil you but careful of the prices, disgusting servicevery expensive and very bad foodthe roast duck is burnt and other food that we ordered tasted no better than ordinary canteen food despite being five times more expensiveservice was practically non existentfor a glass of water you need to ask for several times and soup was still not served even after weve paid the billthere are definitely loads of much better restaurants with fair pricesmore delicious food and more traditional surroundings than this overatedmodern vulgarly designed dump that does not reflect any chinese heritage in both food or dining environment, the roast duck was nice up to standard crispy and doesnt feel greasy so its definitely worth a visit in beijing

the interior design was a little on the quirky side but food was nice, we wanted to try peking duck whilst in beijing and read in the lonely planet  online about da dong we made a booking however we arrived at the wrong branch of the restaurant however the staff were still able to seat us at a shared table which was still fine we ordered a roast duck with 2 sets of condiments for my husband and i this was plentiful it included soup and a fruit platter the duck was the most amazing duck we have ever tasted very lean but still delicious crispy skin i would recommend booking and checking not is the correct branch as many of the private tables had excellent views over the city, had dinner with a colleague at da dong heard some negative sounds as this is a tourist trap and not up to the standard real chinese aim for
the duck we had was roasted to perfection not fat crispy skin and delicious flavor
also the staff cutting the were fabulous and knew exactly what to do briliant presentation
highly recommended, the restaurant looks outstanding i was afraid of being too expensive but i was wrong it is far not so expensive absolutely fair for the quality you get everybody is professional and really kind the food is delicious you must try, my friends and i had roast duck at da dong twice simply because it was so good weve tried duck de chine and jing yaa tang which were not bad but this is really the best

service was also impeccable the servers took the time to explain to us how we were supposed to eat the ducks and they also gave us complementary shaobing hollowed biscuits that you stuff the meat radish minced garlic and hoisin sauce in a specialty that only da dong has when we said we really liked it, we made reservations for da dong recommended by friends and coworkers to have peking duck and more this is a chain restaurant so we were able to walk to the closest one to our hotel we are so happy we got to eat there the food and service were excellent you can watch the chefs make the duck in their ovens if you sit close enough although the servers did not speak english we used google translate and pointed  it worked we got everything we ordered, we have been eating peking duck in the us for over 25 years and so were excited about our eating it in beijing we made a reservation at da dong which was well reviewed and near our hotel

first the attitude was wrong they wanted us to sit next to the waiters station  sorry but no next choice another waiters station now time for the manager and after a conversation and a wait we were seated in the main room if you are here for the decor then this restaurant is a winner

however it is not a winner if you want the famous duck unless presentation is more important than a dry bland duck hurriedly served as if it was fast food move you in serve you and move you out

and the las vegas production of grapes for desert in no way makes up for the unsatisfactory service or food

again sound and fury signifying nothing look elsewhere even in the us for excellent peking duck

the bs, our tour guide took us here our first night in beijing the restaurant was close to our hotel so we just walked over from the regent we ordered the duck of course and then our guide ordered us about 8 other dishes to go with it which was way too much for us but we tried a little of everything everything was sooooo good the food was wonderful the restaurant itself is very niceand busy busy if you have room try the fried ice cream for dessert i would definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you are in beijing and especially if you are staying at the regent just for fun we checked out the other restaurant on the same floor which is a movie themed restaurant and has rooms decorated according to different movies ive never seen anything like it very interesting place, the restaurant is magnificent starting from a beautifully decorated garden the interior of the restaurant is also excellently designed and decorated the food is just marvellous fusion chinese cuisine that takes beijing duck in another level all traditional plates taste zillion times different while you appreciate the well organised place in every aspect no smell no dirt no smoke something rare in beijing enjoy, we wanted to find a highly recommended authentic mandarin restaurant in beijing and this exceptional restaurant exceeded expectations
not easy to find but spacious surrounding gardens lit up at night are the first clue of a special experience about to unfold
a large space with high ceilings and dramatic sculptures set the stage much of the menu is alluring but i recommend following the signature dishes an extensive wine list provides many options although back your judgement on wine selection rather that the service staff recommendations
the peking duck is legendary and for good reason the wagyu with lime and chicken soup were also spectacular
oh and a massive screen showing the celebrity chefs travel adventures
worth the wait but book if you can, i was in beijing for a business trip and one of our customers decided to bring us here for dinner and everything was simply delicious totally recommend the roasted duckit is amazingly good, first of all  the duck is fabulous like all the reviewers mentioned  one of the best duck you will find but the service was just so terrible and the staff so rude that the duck did not make up for it
we went for lunch at about 130 and there was no line  we were given a table immediately as we were looking through the big book of a menu trying to decide what appetizer and dessert and drink we wanted with our duck this really rude lady comes up to the table and asks what duck i understand the lack of english but it does not take a language to identify rude behavior i pointed at their roast duck and ordered one we told her we are still deciding the rest and after 5 minutes while we were still looking at the pretty pictures hoping to order some appetizers she comed back and plops chopsticks and plated in front of us we expected the duck to be carved in front of us but this chef just carved it behind our table  i asked her if that was our duck quite shocked actually and she said yes we did not order more after that i told her that she did not even take our order but she did not seem to care
i know that language can be a problem in china but i have had really good food over the last 2 weeks at much simpler places here  even at places where the staff spoke 0 english but this is the first time in china where i have been treated so rudely i would much rather eat a less tasty duck at a friendly place than the perfect duck at a place like dadong  that is purely a personal preference i am not going back here again and would not recommend this place to friends and family, we went to da dong on a recommendation from a family friend while we wait for almost 2 hours it was worth it we ordered one peking duck to split among three people and it was enough we also ordered two more side dishes everything tastes great and the food was quickly served after ordering one thing that made the wait better was having the free juices also you can grab a seat at the bar, i was here while touring beijing and if you dont mind spend more than you should
it a very nice place with good quality duck and menu items but liked the atmosphere for dinning my gf but i wouldnt come here outside of thatbut the duck is good here
that being saidi think the food and duck at siji minfu restaurant off of wangfujing street is a great deal if not better tasting than this place its not a modern environment but i think the service and quality is all there, i love how this restaurant rotates on the axis of the roasting and preparation of the peking duck try to get a table in view of the chefs  its quite a sight to see them work

i came alone and was grateful that they serve 12 duck i couldnt finish it but did my best i also ordered the mung bean sprouts which are probably the best greens i have ever had

one of the servers took extra care to show me the trick of folding the wrapper with chopsticks  look ma no hands  and came by later to make sure i was doing it right

the tangerines on dry ice at the end was delightful and they were sweet like candy so no need for dessert

fantastic food and great service in a modern setting, excellent restaurant all dishes were very tasty with great plating all personnel from reception to the waiters are very professional and helpful kind and smiling, we enjoyed our dinner at da dong roast ducks tuanjiehu location they had excellent cocktails wonderful service clean modern restaurant however this was my first peking duck and i was not a fan of the crunchy bird i like my duck moist and tender but the restaurant was great had i known what the peking duck was like i may have ordered a large bird for just the two off us so i would get more meat none the less i would go to this restaurant and order something else it was a good restaurant, visited a few years ago my wife and i dinned with her business companions this is a great looking restaurant with a view of the duck cooking display the service is beyond excellent a lively atmosphere that offers a great dinning experience

visit and enjoy, our hotel made reservations for us at 9 pm we arrived at 10 minutes after nine and was seated immediately waited about 30 minutes to have a waiter come over and take our order when he finally took our order he told us there was no more duck available how could a restaurant known for peeking duck and not have any peeking duck left we spent the next half hour arguing with the management to make us a duck because it was not that they had no ducks available its that they wanted to close and did not want to make any more duck finally they agreed to give us a half of one duck this was after we had to even call our hotel and have the concierge intervene we had only one night in beijing as we explained and this was going to be our only mail and our only chance to have peking duck we also ordered fish which on the menu was approximately us$20 for 500 g to our surprise they charged us three people for 25 kg almost $100 us there was so much fish we could not even finish it the food was very good but the experience was made miserable and expensive because of the poor service and unwillingness to make any efforts there are many restaurants in beijing and judging from my experience tonight i will never return unfortunate because i have been there many times they need to understand what customer service is when they see people they need to make sure that they can serve them the full menu not only what they choose to cook for lack of time the chefs just wanted to go home and thats why they refused to cook us a duck, a beautiful place to try some traditional dishes splendidly presented the duck is sublime so are the desserts service is generally good, this restaurant was recommended by our concierge for the roast peking duck we did not have reservations but went to eat on a wednesday nite at about 6pm when we arrived there were empty tables in the main dining room but the host took the 2 of us to a large round table in a back room with what looked like a curtain for a tablecloth there were maybe 4 other tables in this back room we sat there for about 3 minutes before we got up and went back to the host and asked for a table in the dining room for our last most expensive meal in beijing we did not want to sit in a dark back room a hostess then seated us at a nice table we ordered 12 of the duck which the waiter said would be enough for the 2 of us but could have eaten a whole duck it looks like a lot on the platter but after slicing it up it was not enough i would recommend this restaurant the service was good and the food was good but dont take a back room table and if there are 2 of you with a good appetite you can probably eat a whole duck, i stood in line here once waiting for a table and an american woman next to me asked me if da dong was worth the wait i replied in the style of the carlsberg beer advertisements that this was probably the best chinese restaurant in the world and it just might be the beijing duck is superb skin melts on tongue but there are many great beijing duck restaurants around whats great here is the other food and as usual we over ordered mushrooms with basil great local dumplings four gras cherries must have a delicious gong bao prawn dish a fresh broad bean dish and a knockout crab ok rmb1700 for a live fresh king crab cooked in an egg white sauce that was out of this world hong kong where i live has some amazing cantonese places but da dong is my favorite chinese restaurant i think and i try to go whenever i am in beijing great cocktails as well if in doubt go probably, this meal was fantastic we went with our local office who prebooked everything the chefs took time to show and explain how they prepared and cooked the duck service staff attentive and excellent presentation colour and taste of food was outstanding my best chinese meal ever, during our recent visit to peking we had the privilege of eating at the above it was great we really enjoyed it the duck was the best we ever ate my wife loved it i liked it very much also it was probably the best food that we ate in china the side dishes were also very good but at da dong its all about the duck","fastfood",0.730620852790618

��, select the nobu japanese restaurant on the first floor of the jw marriott hotel there is no kind of izakaya crowded more than a point of comfort and enjoyment here dishes can also be a single point of the package chefs intentions and careful sophisticated enough to make people become regulars cod is very tender sashimi is also very fresh
��, have been to nobu in san diego in the states and have long been wanting to try the nobu in beijing after a long day of work and wanted to pamper myself with a good sushi dinner went with my sushi buddy to try nobu beijing was disappointed at first as they didnt have uni so no uni hand roll
��, my first experience at nobu was in london this is not the same scene its very much localised the food though top class with the specials on the menu hitting the spot like any nobu around the globe people eat early in this town so dont expect the same vibe go for the food and service, while entertaining guest from asia who were also visiting beijing we had dinner and nobu and it is recommended the menu offers a wide variety of asian based dishes which should appeal to many different people the restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated and the staff does an excellent job of serving you in an not obtrusive way it is

��, having been to nobu in hong kong for a special dinner with the presence of nobu san himself i came with high expectation when i visited the nobu in beijing service was very attentive perhaps as i was only the few guests there on the night however food was just ok highlight wouldve been the toro with caviar however the
��, in the jw marriott the food is perfect nobu believe the ratings $$$$$ i had a small nobu sashimi plate for lunch with two beers  us$200 but those 14 bites were worth every penny, an amazing experience i had with nobu restaurant very polite staff and had an amazing service they all speak english which was very convenient as for the food it was tasty and great i enjoyed it very much we went on a weekday so it wasnt crowded for the prices it was reasonable and good for a 5 star restaurant
��, i had high expectations given this restaurant carried the nobu brand we ordered the 888 tasting menu for the full experience each dish was pleasant but not mind blowing in either composition or quality of ingredients the sushi course was what you would get in any decent sushi restaurant and some of the sashimi was overpowered by lemon juice and
��, can i say its overpriced for its offering yes not because of the quality of the food but the service the pairing has to work right to elevate the taste the service we received that day was on par with a local pizza hut there were little to no mention of the course that was served they look fancy but

generous portion of food and the restaurant attendants were very attentive throughout the dining period
greatly recommend this restaurant for a nice meal
side note the restaurant served traditional dessert as well we didnt order as we were too full with the meal, we were doing some late night shopping at the silk market and were hungry so we wandered across the busy street in the financial district to a side street right behind the samsung building thats when we fell upon this place it had quite a crowd of people waiting to get in and we had no reservation but they seated us within 10 minutes multilevel restaurant upstairs seemed more quaint and there was a rooftop patio as well everything we tried was authentic and delicious price was extremely reasonable for the quality of the food this was my favorite place to eat in beijing lucky accident, <u+5728><u+65b0><u+83ef><u+4fdd><u+96aa><u+9577><u+5b89><u+8857><u+6700><u+7e41><u+83ef><u+7684><u+4e00><u+6392><u+5927><u+5ec8><u+5411><u+5f8c><u+9762><u+7684><u+5c0f><u+8857><u+8d70><u+53bb><u+5076><u+7136><u+767c><u+73fe><u+4e86><u+9019><u+5bb6><u+90a3><u+5bb6><u+5c0f><u+9928><u+3002><u+88dd><u+4fee><u+7279><u+5225><u+597d><u+6709><u+56db><u+5408><u+9662><u+7ba1><u+5b50><u+548c><u+5674><u+6dcb><u+5c31><u+88f8><u+9732><u+5728><u+5916><u+9762><u+537b><u+4e00><u+9ede><u+4e5f><u+4e0d><u+5f71><u+97ff><u+7f8e><u+89c0><u+3002><u+5750><u+4e0b><u+4f86><u+9ede><u+4e86><u+5e7e><u+500b><u+5317><u+4eac><u+83dc><u+5176><u+5be6><u+90fd><u+662f><u+5317><u+4eac><u+83dc><u+6539><u+826f><u+7684><u+3002><u+597d><u+5403><u+3002><u+6703><u+7d93><u+5e38><u+4f86><u+3002><u+4e5f><u+63a8><u+85a6><u+7d66><u+7b2c><u+4e00><u+6b21><u+4f86><u+5317><u+4eac><u+7684><u+670b><u+53cb><u+5011><u+3002>, although not in the hutongs or the old town beijing this restaurant still delivers good beijing style food with a nice ambiance being a beijing native i especially enjoy the sesame paste pancake a snack most beijingers grew up with every course tasted great love the ambiance and bird calling other impressive dishes include pear soup and simple stirfried cabbage its the simple food done excellent that is sometimes most difficult to achieve and this restaurant certainly did on the downside it is a bit noisy which is very common in chinese especially beijing restaurant so not too suitable for business meetings, after trb on the first night we decided to go for some local food
this is very easy to get to by mtr it is just next to the mtr exit  exit the twin towers
they do not take booking but our hotel concierge called the restaurant and put us on the queue it took us 20 mins later to reach the restaaurants and we were already seated in another 10mins and it was aroudn 1945

service is very quick and value for money

quite a large menu and one may find some amusement reading the translations
not a fan of the signature soup but one must trip their signature shrimp dishes
the beef brisket was also very very good they also had a roast duck but we werent able to order that cuz there were only 2 of us but i saw a lot of people ordering it, <u+6574><u+9ad4><u+88dd><u+6f62><u+5f88><u+6709><u+5927><u+5b85><u+9662><u+7684><u+611f><u+89ba><u+6709><u+9ede><u+61f7><u+820a><u+6c23><u+606f><u+83dc><u+8272><u+5e7e><u+4e4e><u+90fd><u+633a><u+597d><u+5403><u+7684><u+50f9><u+9322><u+4e0a><u+4e5f><u+633a><u+5408><u+7406><u+975e><u+5e38><u+9069><u+5408><u+5e36><u+5916><u+570b><u+670b><u+53cb><u+4f86><u+9ad4><u+9a57><u+4f7f><u+7528><u+624b><u+6a5f><u+652f><u+4ed8><u+66f4><u+5e38><u+6709><u+512a><u+60e0>, <u+771f><u+7684><u+5f88><u+559c><u+6b61><u+9019><u+9593><u+9910><u+5ef3> <u+6b21><u+6b21><u+4f86><u+90fd><u+9580><u+5ead><u+82e5><u+5e02> <u+5916><u+9762><u+4e00><u+500b><u+53e4><u+5178><u+5c0f><u+9580><u+5b8c><u+5168><u+4e0d><u+77e5><u+88e1><u+9762><u+5ead><u+9662><u+6df1><u+6df1><u+5225><u+6709><u+6d1e><u+5929> <u+98df><u+7269><u+8272><u+9999><u+5473><u+4ff1><u+5168> <u+6bcf><u+76e4><u+7cbe><u+54c1><u+6a23><u+7684><u+98df><u+7269><u+90fd><u+986f><u+793a><u+4e86><u+5e2b><u+5085><u+7684><u+529f><u+529b> <u+9084><u+6709><u+5f88><u+591a><u+5176><u+4ed6><u+9910><u+5ef3><u+5403><u+4e0d><u+5230><u+7684><u+83dc><u+8272> <u+50f9><u+683c><u+4e5f><u+975e><u+5e38><u+4fbf><u+5b9c>, we were staying at the fairmont beijing and this was an easy walk from our hotel the place is huge with an indoor courtyard and plants and a nice bustling atmosphere we tried the venison rolls honey beef  rice and oily greens and two beers this was one of our most expensive meals in beijing at $45 usd, this restaurant is worth a visit location is very beautiful typical chinese style there is even a courtyard inside but what is even better is the food very tasty beautiful arranged just yummy  and the stuff is very friendly kitchen is quick and price is also ok what more van you expect, thanks to ta for this find close to our hotel fairmont beijing i printed the information about the restaurant before leaving home and showed it to the concierge for directions when she smiled we knew it was good we walked about 3 blocks to the location but still couldnt identify the restaurant without help the restaurant has 2 red lanterns in front

we arrived at 5 just when the restaurant opened for dinner and were immediately seated the menu book with photos made ordering easy the 3 of us ordered fried shrimp spicy chicken with garlic and walnuts special beef with honey and water chestnuts mixed vegetables and steamed rice along with 2 beers and a coke the food was delicious our bill was 350 yuan  about $50 us

the restaurant was full when we left, a good find in the financial district of beijing good food although wine was a bit pricey restaurant is fairly large but good atmosphere and well set out enjoyed the evening here, this is near the silk market  behind the samsung building its not hard to find on baidu map

easily one of the nicest places i ate at during my month in beijing the food is simply delicious and the atmosphere is lovely the service is also excellent so thats a wonderful combination of taste atmosphere and service they will also ask you about allergies and msg etc

yes its more expensive than your average restaurant but its also one of the nicest, we visited this place during our holiday the restaurant is a very nice place we had our table at the roofbalcony staff does not speak english but they try to understand you food was delicious the duck was strange  not prepared as the original peking duck but tasted very well, ive traveled extensively through china i really appreciate a clean restaurant from the moment we walked in i knew this restaurant was clean the tables were beautifully set the decor was beautiful the windows were clear even the bathrooms were pretty and clean
our table was set with a sealed wet cloth to wash our hands the menu was a book with photos of the food even the food was beautifully displayed check out the dumpling photo our food was delicious i loved the sticky rice sticks and the shrimp was delicious unfortunately venison wasnt in season, went there a few days ago with a group of four it seems to slightly up scale chinese place  though still very inexpensive for europeans 120 cnyish per person

the food was good spicy but nothing fancy the waiters where overall friendly but the place is busy we tried to get a reservation but got on waiting list from which we got a seat 20 minutes after arrival, food is very nice but most of the dishes are friend  for lovers of such food this is a great place of course make sure to try
1 the shrimps
2 the duck  it is prepared in a different way than beijing duck so it is quite interesting

the atmosphere is great  very nice and old traditional house personnel is friendly english is barely existent as in most of the places

the restaurant is located behing the lg towers on yonganli  around it there are also few other very good restaurants, my family and i ate dinner at this restaurant while in beijing we had never had manchurian food before and loved all the dishes we sampled  great flavours and presentation one suggestion to other dinersmake sure you order a side dish of rice to counteract the spicy dishes loved the atmosphere we were upstairs on the balcony looking down at the main floor highly recommended easy to find on google maps, went on a sunday night did not do any bookings but was lucky to get a table within 10 mins the lamb ribs were amazing so were the other dishes prices are affordable and service attentive portions are good for 23 pax assuming you order 34 dishes the ambiance is old world and nostalgic the brids crysong from time to time further liven up the foot and atmosphere, we ate here during our recent trip to beijing and were delighted with our choice the restaurant is quite large and on saturday night as we left around 900pm people were queuing for a table please note that you cannot make a reservation the cuisine is manchurian a first for us we really enjoyed our prawns with lychee stirfried greens and beef and mushroom accompanied by some yanjing beer the staff who speak very little english were friendly and helpful, this is a manchurian restaurant we went there around lunch time and our tour guide told us their shrimp is very famous it was excellent and we ordered 2 plates for the 9 of us we order other dishes including deer meat and pork with dates on top the pork is too fatty for us but for those who love fat pork you hit a jackpot the deer meat was very different and came with some round bread crust surprisingly not very gamey the bathroom is very clean and the atmosphere is very good we were at the second floor price was a bit higher but you pay for what you get, if i am going to have just 1 meal in beijing this will be the place i will go serves traditional food fare that are delicious the restaurant is constantly busy but i never felt it was overly noisy or unmanagable waiting staffs were efficient and food prices reasonable, we have been here for the second time first at noon and now at dinner atmosphere is old china with lot of wood two decks a couple of talking blackbirds people are well coming with some english but with food the place reached the full stars try try cauliflowers with pepper and garlic  the prawns spicely fried the cold potato purea all worth a visit, had a meal in a private room with 8 people most of whom were beijingers so we had a wide range of dishes and an excellent meal was had from such a wide range of dishes highlights were
bbqd beef rib bbq meat skewers sichuan pepper fish tofu and chilli beef the lotus root cold starter
good value for the quality of the restaurant and the quality of the food, very authentic and busy the ladies on the door tending the waiting list are on the hop and there are many local customers dont let the view from the outside or the pure beijing feeling inside be any threshold the waitresses are looking after you here just trust them inside decor is great very relaxed atmosphere now onto the food  there is a picture menu but with style so many things to choose from when the food came it was better than the pictures and the tasteexcellent fantastic mouthwatering  choose your own superlative only challenge here is not to overeat the staff were outstanding and know exactly the fine line of attentiveness and interfering in a wonderful experience and meal, a hidden gem if you havent found it on trip advisor enjoyed the meal and especially the traditional deserts a tray filled with lovely delights, great food and atmosphere time out award winner for best chinese casual dining close to china world hotel and mall, travelling on my own for business and only speaking english finding restaurants can be tough this was an excellent find near my hotel and thd menu is clarly in english and illustrated food was absolutely excellent in a traditional setting

the outside of the restaurant is not that clear with just uniformed staff outside so do not miss it, we made reservations through our hotel and had no problems getting there from the subway line which is about a five minute walk from the restaurant id recommending familiarizing yourself with a photo of the entrance just so you know what youre looking for

not much english spoken but the menu is large with colorful photos depicting the dishes accurately wonderful local delicacies such as the pork belly with beijing dates but just be warned that the portions are pretty large and are meant to be shared we didnt realize that initially and ordered five or so plates for the two of us and ended up with a ton of food left over id also recommend the crispy lychee prawns which are plump sweet and savory, this is the ultimate combination of great food with a very chinese setting the problem with places like lost heaven or hakkasan is that whilst the food is fantastic they lack the traditional loud busy chinese feel na jia xiaoguan equals in food quality  although some dishes are a bit much for western taste  without sacrificing on mood a must see whilst in beijing the womens toilets only have holes on the floor, every dish served was tasty hot corn drink was served during winter which i really enjoyed after being in the cold the fish head and pork belly meat with dates were most memorable but really all dishes were good and our 12 seat table was filled with many dishes, always a wait but usually moves quickly little english spoken but extensive menu available in english with pictures but with little description of food be adventuresome everything we had was excellent definitely not touristsonly as we saw mostly locals and most of those were young","hot pot house",0.959354378512443

��, it just wasnt right from the beginning the menu was difficult to understand let alone to find something that sounded tasty and edible a week early we dined at the singapore marriott and had a terrific peking duck multicourse dinner but man ho didnt have peking duck on the menu needless to say we ordered soup appetizers entrees and pasta

��, have not had teppanyaki for a long time and needed an appropiate location for a business dinner with a guest from germany in germany those kind of restaurants are hard to find so i thought it is a good choice tairyo is a chain thought nothing can go wrong first of all have to say that this location is more
��, this is one of the best teppanyaki i was eating before the oysters the sushi the meat and also the dessert was just great, best meal ever a perfect way to end our beijing adventure a buffet costs only 219 yuan and then you can simple choose everything from the menu card and drinks card with a privat chef to prepare and grill your food and a very friendly staff this is a top choice, we had the buffet and the tuna beef sushi was so nice we ordered dessert but then seen someone ordering the beef and had to order it and so glad we did party of 4 people we all loved it, we were 5 people of which one vegetarian as nobody in the restaurant speaks english it was very difficult to order food at the end the vegetarian food all had meat and shrimps in it the other food was quite ok delicious sushi and sashimi very nice shrimps not so tasty scallops and tough and chewy beef the restaurant offers
��, the service is good dont get me wrong its just not the level that i prefer some places in beijing pretend to be all you can eat and after a few plates they train the waitresses to ignore you and when you do get an order of 10 sushi youll actually receive 34 this is a money saving tactic by
��, the food was very good we recommend to take the all you can eat for 268 rmb a lot of veriaty that is made by the shef in front of you, we got the restaurant recommended and wasnt disappointed at all we did think it was a sushi restaurant but in fact it is more focused on anything that can be fried the concept of the restaurant is that you pay an amount and then you can order anything from the menu except ala carte i would guess including drinks you
��, the offer many choices and as long as you have a big appetite you will get your moneys worth the sashimi were not the best weve had as it was not properly defrosted but still good, a very good place for teppanyaki with a great young male chef however they dont speak much english at all
��, went with two colleagues all of us wanted japanese food and we couldnt get a seat elsewhere bad choice ordered a lot of food as one of my colleagues always does and we left about 13 in to the meal beef was awful quality not even sure that it was beef at all scallops were ok but very small generally
��, this place was just relocated near the old place much better atmosphere and more spacious the food could be better if they were not serving frozen sashimis at some point of the evening and they usually do not serve what you ordered thinking you wont remember that some dishes were never served it saves them money teh best deal is
��, tairyos is usually a great place to go with a group of friends the bigger the group the better the sanlitun village branch where i went twice last week invitation not choice is really nicely decorated with a good ambience  although be warned there are no bathrooms in the restaurant so you have to venture out to the public
��, enjoyed this restaurant on the recommendation of some colleagues while in beijing on business as im allergic to shellfish the staff made special considerations to cook my food on a clean grill free from anyone elses dishes im still here and didnt die so thats a win the food was fresh and prepared quickly the service was good and the
��, the food at tairyo was different and exciting with variety to suit everyones tastes we had an entertaining and friendly chef that made the whole experience even more enjoyable as he drank with us inbetween cooking  gambei the food is a bit pricey in comparison to other sites around beijing but for the quantity and quality of the restaurant
��, tairyo is famous for their allyoucaneat package which is a bit pricey but definitely worth it i remember noticing that their sanlitun branch is a bit pricier than their branch at zhongguancun food was really good and they had a lot of varieties too their sashimi was so fresh but i found that their sushi was disappointing i also loved
��, tairyo locate 3rd floor of sanlitun village to get a seat at dinner you need make reservation tairyo is famous
��, a little bit more expensive than last time but it still worths a visit be prepared to order you food at least twice they use to forget what you order, the ingredients in both sashimi and what they grill were high class fresh and tasty the allyoucaneat buffet is worth considering as the portions are not that huge the wines that are included are modest but then again 268 rmb per person is not excessive for the deal and for beer you get also asahi our waiter did not speak
��, so they have moved to a newer locationabout 200m from the previous place the decor is is nicely done with
��, i visited this restaurant for the first time during a trip to beijing being teppanyaki style you sit around a table and your chef cooks the food in front of you the great selling point of this restaurant chain is the all inclusive packages for <u+00a3>25 we had all you can eat and drink for the whole evening this includes
��, wow� this place� this is a place that you just cant afford in europe beautiful interior very clean it was the first time i ordered sashimi  and i was blown away the sashimi plate contained many perfect cuts of fish and seafood on ice it was incredible they have great sushi too first time i ate sea urchin sushi
��, long long time ago it was my fav restaurant i havent been there for a long time  and the service has become really awful the waiters poured things several times to guests and even didnt say sorry for that also they say that they close at 11 pm but they started to collect the plates around 1030 even didnt
��, i first visited tairyo japanese restaurant in sanlitun village in 2012 then it was very good and this months visit was very good as well they have a 198 rmb everything included package at noon time and 238 rmb package in the evenings you can enjoy japanese teppenyaki food at its best the tastes are not explainable by words you
��, like ive read in a few other peoples review of this place they would always forget some of your orders i think its their way of ensuring that no one wastes food its nice but it does get pretty annoying ordering the same thing over and over and not having it served the price is great for an all you
��, the price is ok for allyoucan eat package however i dont know if it is a rule from the restaurant or some misunderstanding but everytime we have to order sashimi they either forget some of them or just dont serve at all i am not the kind of person who is very rude with waiters but sometimes i really want
��, thats a very good option for us to be invited by our local partners to this all you can eat japanese teppenyaki restaurantquality of the food is not considered as topbut he quantityportions are very important and as we always dideverybody orders more than they can consumethe only problem here is the service and communication with the service staff as
��, we didnt know what to expect having had quite a few high quality teppanyaki experiences in major cities in asia this was a delightful entertaining and relaxing experience much more casual and lowbrow than past experiences but very worthwhile nonetheless while the quality of the food was a little uneven overall it was very good and the variety was impressive
��, i will start by saying that i really like the food at tairyo and the price seems reasonable for allyoucan eat every time ive been i tell myself im not going back because of the annoyance 1 dont actually expect to get everything you order i swear if they think you are eating or ordering too much they just dont
��, great food selection and experience make sure you book a table rather go for later because they might rush you out at 8pm, have been to this restaurant chain a number of times and location the seafood is fresh and my favorites are
��, i still cannot believe we paid only 240 rmb per person to eat fabulous amounts of sushi and sashimi beef fillets seafood sake beer and desserts the atmosphere is also very good beautifully decorated and the chef will prepare the food in your table its a place you cannot miss when you visit beijing, we ate here the other night and really enjoyed our meal we chose a la carte rather than the all
��, i visited tairyo teppanyaki at sanlitun a few days ago this was the 2nd time i ate there the first time was with a larger group of about 10 friends this last time was just 2 people me and a friend to start this place is more fun if you go eat with a larger team it is very social
��, tairyo is the only japanese restaurant i would recommend in beijing good food nice staff and relaxing atmosphere i like their deal it as much as you want and it is a good value for money ive been to beijing for almost 3 years and each time my friends or business partners come over we go to taiyro it is

the noodles are also excellent as they are hand made and surprisingly fresh
the overall prices are cheap and a very good value considering the high quality ingredients around 26 rmb for 6 dumplings or for a bowl of noodles, great meal with family lots of choices good prices and plenty of food
thoroughly recommend for lunch or dinner, wasnt my favorite dumpling place bau yuan did it for me but there were a lot of filling options friendly for both vegans and meat eaters, i simply cannot understand the many positive reviews of this place we had 3 different dumplings and they all tasted the same there are far better dumpling places all over town, we got a dumpling sampler and the oil splash noodles appropriately named youve been warned and both were delicious were big dumpling lovers and while everything was scrumptious the noodles really stole the show they were handmade in view and they were so fresh and delicious and perfect mmm mouth is watering thinking about them the restaurant is in a hutong tight alley so itll be hard to get a cab to take you youll have to probably walk though there are main roads nearby that you can have a cab take you to we loved walking through the area on the way therelots of fun shops there is no bathroom insideonly a public bathroom out on the street which is really no fun in the winter so know that also definitely a fair amount of white tourists there but some locals too menus were in english and chinese so it was easy to order, had some really delicious dumplings there if you get the right table you can also watch them prepare your meal, who doesnt like dumplings at mr shi they are just world class always fresh and just cooked to perfection enjoy the many many difference flavors to choose from, this little restaurant is situated in one hutong not far from the gulou you can easily find it there i was looking for some place to enjoy chinese dumplings and thanks to tripadvisor i found this one but it is a really veryvery good one though the place is small but they have a wide variety of dumplings and different noodles and and meat which they cook just opposite in front of you i visited this cafe several times and do recommend it to everyone, back in a hutong alley very small place only about 5 tables in there but there was only one other couple in the place they have a large menu and you can order many different types of dumplings i highly recommend getting a sampler with three different flavors shrimp and egg were delicious so were pork and spring onion they provide you with fresh garlic and soy sauce as well but beware  the garlic is potent you can watch them handmake the dumplings from a window right by your table makes for great photos overall a cheap and delicious meal highly recommend, the food here is good and the menu is extensive enough to please everyone however this place is really overpriced for what you get i would recommend bao yuan jiao zi guan as a better place that isnt quite as pricey, we arrived to this place on a freezing december evening after navigating the hutongs easy if you are using a gps the dumplings were some of the best ever freshly made in front of you and with endless fillings you can also mix and match which is great if you want to try as many as possible this place is very westerner friendly but the taste and atmosphere are all authentic, amazing little place in the hutongs near the drum and bell tower a lovely quirky small place with notes on the walls from other travellers that have visited i think i saw a scottish saltire on the wall haha quick service and you can see the dumplings being prepared i had the fried dumplings and they were delicious  mr shi even offers dessert dumplings the menu is extensive and is great value for money too menus are in chinese and english the food was amazing and the staff were wonderful definitely worth a visit so tasty, friendly staff great fresh food its fast and easy to order if you dont speak chinese obviously get dumplings, i went without knowing anything about the hype of other reviews on tripadvisor its a small restaurant in the hutong with quick service and some really good food if you are a chinese food connoisseur it is probably far too westernized for your palate but for me it was ideal as i was not feeling adventurous id done that all week and wanted something a bit less challenging to my palate it is clearly frequented by students travellers and english speakers  if you are looking for an authentic chinese experience go elsewhere if you just want some good food go here, dumplings were very good with an english menu and choice of fried or boiled the dessert ones were a new experience beer was a bit overpriced probably because they get so many tourists in the walls are interesting with many tourists leaving their mark, so i have been to many of the mr shi dumplings restaurants and this one bao chao is my favoritethe dumplings are the main reason to go but they have other classic chinese food options as well my favorite dumplings are the fried variety and i would recommend the beef and coriander and the pork and shrimp its a little pricier than usual chinese restaurants but the quality of the food never disappoints staff are very friendly and can understand the english from the menu i love this place and will be going back for sure, quality food ++

delicious dumplings worth the search because its in an alley far the best so far in beijing you have a lot of choice in fillings you can also choose between fried or boiled the best part of this all they make it fresh the menu is in english what else do you want

tip 1 try de banana chocolate fried dumplings 2 go with a group and share a lot of them, searched high and low for this place and finally found it on google streetview but spent an hour going up and down the street looking for it i finally called a friend who told me where it was and that they had recently had an issue with construction and had to move the door

a pokie little place with great dumplings i especially like their own chili oil that actually tastes of chili and not just oil

not fine dining by a long shot but great for your dumpling cravings, in the middle of the hutong it is a small place with english menus the dumpings are great they have all kind of juices, close by our hotel we visited mr shis on 3 occasions  but only had dumplings once
we ordered a mix of boiled and baked and although tasty they werent really for me
on the other occasions we had more traditional with a tourist twist food which proved very good
you can watch the cooks prepare the dumplings or noodles if you order wine they might have to pop to the shop across the hutong to get another bottle  but at least they do
staff are good and will help guide you through the menu advising on taste spiciness etc
the fact that we returned twice says a lot  and it was not because it was convenient  there were many restaurants nearby, we had 2 plates of dumplings around 30 rmb for 15 pcs choose if you want them boiled or fried we preferred the former but try both you can mix and match between different fillings and you can basically have them filled with whatever you want so its easy to eat vegetarian  which is great since many places in beijing fill them with pork which i dont eat
the gong bao chicken was delicious and genuine too although not spicy enough for me good prices too the kids liked it very much too a strong recommend, i hadnt heard of this place but whilst wearily wandering around the hutangs the food and drinks really hit the spot in fact during my stay i virtually ate dumplings every day and these were the tastiest with the filling of beef and coriander as my favourite yes it may be touristy but so are many of the places in beijing we visited in november and we were the only tourists there the rest of the customers were locals
the juices were also pretty special, they have a large variety of dumplings to choose from you can have them either fried or boiled we chose fried i wouldn�t say they were the best dumplings i�ve ever had but it was still very tasty we also ordered a delicious cucumber salad that had some nice spice to it good value for the food and the service was helpful, the thousand year old eggs were good but the dumplings we had were just average  maybe we hit them on a bad nite because they come highly recommend next time were are in beijing we will try them again, ok guys calm down i waited years to come and try the famous mr shi dumpings  feel the magic  but honestly speaking ive eaten better
i dont recommend fried dumplings boiled dumplings are ok but you can find same quality every corner in china
a place with all foreign customers not very attractive to local people i believe, this restaurant was a hit with me i was taken her by a friend who had been there before their selection is massive and were delicious we had some o, this dumpling place has a very casual setting but the food is delicious plentiful and wellpriced lots of dumpling filling selections including many vegetarian i ordered too much not realizing there would be 15 dumplings in an order i got a noodle soup as well and it was much bigger than the photo in the menu delicious comfort food, it wasnt awful but its definitely a 25 stars rounded up really i was pretty excited to try their dumplings given their high ta rating and was expecting a fun local spot in reality its more of a hostel dining room  geared up to feel comfortable to people who would perhaps really rather be back in the west it walks a strange line between student bar and euro youth hostel with sharpie scrawlings from people all over the walls

dumplings were fine theyre definitely more expensive than other dumplings and nothing particularly special  but the menu is in english and they have a whole range catering to less adventurous pallets

not a spot to travel large distances for  but a comfortable pit stop if youre feeling travel weary, we stopped by mr shis on the recommendation of tripadvisor and it did not disappoint after finding our way down a very narrow hutong alley we finally found a spot and we were ushered in to a table  we had a very large party and our tour guide had been kind enough to phone ahead for us

we went for lunch and we ordered several of their dumpling sets  which include a selection of their bestselling dumplings both steamed and fried they have a huge variety and it is easy to get lost in the menu  fortunately the staff is actually good at recommending what to get for a group of our size

while everything we ordered was great the fried dumplings are definitely heads and shoulders above everything else  they really are the house special any of the dumplings with cheese proved to be a bit with our group and i had never actually seen dumplings with cheese the dessert dumplings also quite unique were great  the ones with chocolate are pretty great

you should be aware that they actually have two locations on the same street  one houses the kitchen and is a bit bigger and the other is like an overflow dining room the smaller one does not have a restroom and you may be stuck using the public restroom next door the other thing is that our guide and some locals described this restaurant as pricey  while you can get cheaper dumplings elsewhere it is still cheap by american standards expect to pay about 78 usd per person for a great meal and it is very accessible for tourists, we have been here during our last two visits in beijing in the last three years and love the place the variety of dumplings makes this place a must, go there  its lovely close to orchid hotel too also recommended highly and a very atmospheric area forget the main beijing sites the hutong area is where it is at, mr shis was recommended by the local expats who took us there  so glad they did mounds of delicious dumplings swift service no disappointments if youre visiting the drum and bell towers this is just round the corner not to be missed, this was the best dumplings we had in china in fact it was so good we went back the next day the juice is excellent as well and all really cheap just a word of warning though unless you are used to using the hutong toilets go before you get there, you must try mr shi great atmosphere and great food on a typical beijing hutong you wont be disappointed, we were recommended this place by our hotel which was nearby when we asked about getting authentic dumplings granted it can be touristy but there is a good mix of people here we found tourists and locals when we went and loved the hutong location and vibe the food was superb easy menus helpful staff and reasonable prices thoroughly recommended its very near south luogu lane and its amazing bars stores and markets so another reason to visit thanks mr shi one of our great memories of beijing, this place is situated in a hutong near the drum and bell tower it has got a great selection of dumplings and other dishes and the atmosphere is informal and friendly original decoration and a good mixture of locals and tourists the menus are in english and the waiting staff have few problems understanding your order dont expect gourmet food or a typical chinese atmosphere  this is a travellers restaurant but the food is good and the prices very reasonable oh and the wifi works a treat something of a rarity in beijing, so i took my chinese wife to this place when we were in beijing because of the reviews i had read i must say my wife thought it was the worst dumplings she ever had and i have to agree it was a huge disappointment because we made the special trip half way across the city just to go there we even left most of it on the table and left thankfully for my sake there was a couple  excellent dumpling houses just down the street there are so so many other places to go but you need to stay away from tourist reviews because they have no idea what great chinese food really is, very good restaurant 
 there are many flavours
 among the specialities you can choose between fried or boiled dumplings
 its not fat and the ingredients are fresh
 good value for money , never fails even improve i went yesterday with some friends after a while and i honestly think they have improved bigger dumplings better service more dishes and very reasonable price
if you want to eat dumplings definitely this is the place to go, great place lot of tourists but locals seems to enjoy the place as well good pork and leeks dumplings a bit pricey compare to other nonenglish speaking place but hey you pay to know what you are eating try the other mr shi for another kind of experience totally recommend, dont be turned off by the simple small venue instead try all sorts of dumplingscurry carrot beef pork chicken and chives oh my god we ate so many dumplings and they were all absolutely delicious it was embarrassing how inexpensive it was a true dumpling adventure

while youre waiting for your dumplings ask for the can of markers so you can add some grafitti to the colorful wall art, der reading all the great reviews we thought we had to visit this restaurant after eating there we were a bit disappointed the dumplings are okay but not the best and it seemed like there were only western tourists going there it was nice that we could choose 3 different dumplings and get 5 of each for 50 yuan, this restaurant is popular with both foreigners and locals amazing variety of dumplings and they are good good value for money perfect for quick meals, overpriced  overrated i usually trust reviews on tripadvisor but this one was disappointing

i got fried mutton pork  cabbages pork  corn dumplings 5 each for total of 55 yuan with hot sour soup and paid 70 yuan

it just simply was not good maybe because i ordered fried ones dry meat was far from being mouth watering its like all juice from meat and vegetables got drained into oil when fried good dumplings should be crunchy crispy on the outside but juicy inside

if you think they are good you must be a foreigner i am a foreigner and still thought they werent good

workers seem friendly and nice though
yet i had to wait 30 min for dumplings to be served and they charge for using chopsticks seriously

not touristy local place i sometimes get my lunch 22 yuan for 10 dumplings and let me tell you they are not the cheapest place and they taste so much better

lastly and sadly my chinese friends who were born and raised in beijing said theyve never even heard about this place = not good enough for locals

a good experience but never coming back, we went here with our family and tour group we had dumplings both steamed and baked and the steamed were the best beijing style i have ever had my understanding is they make them a little differently in the south we ordered probably 11 different dishes and all were good we especially surprised at how good the egg plant was i wish i could remember the names of all the dishes but i cannot it is a little more expensive than the smaller street vendor places but the quality is worth it, dumplings are fine but some of the other dishes are a little bland very popular with foreign tourists worth a visit","self-serviсe buffet",0.996101278932914

��, fantastic meal at the sanlitun area in beijing the ambiance in the restaurant was great and the menu was extensive food presentation was good and there was sufficient quantity to leave you feeling full, nice place good food not must visit but good place to have a dinner or lunch democratic prices grill dishes are attractive, passing through beijing on our way to chengdu friends recommended this place so off to lunch we went my ruben sandwich was pretty good and my wife had the pastrami ruben again good sandwich the fries were just ok nice atmosphere and im sure this place is packed most nights and weekends given its location, dinner here christmas eve located in an upscale mall an open late mall was very busy so gave this a shot this is just like chilis or fridays type food if you dont like smoking indoors then avoid the bar area bartender is very good at what she does one of the best foodwise was pretty decent had the nachos

��, we came here the once to try it and my eyes were far too bog for my stomach i ordered a lot the scalloped potatoes gratin were gorgeous but so filling and i had ordered this as a side to my main as well as a half portion of the steak pasta as a starter which to be honest was
��, nice american atmosphere here big rib eye steak medium rare was beautiful cold carlsberg on draft was welcome on a hot evening  service was very good will return, i was in beijing for 3 months this was as close to american food you could find the menu is greatservice was unmatched anywhere great place thanks andy see you soon, i visited last week union grille to compare their food and service with blue frog i would say the atmosphere at union is a bit better while the food and service is comparable, getting an even decent burger in beijing is close to impossible  but union bar and grille does make a burger close to good european cafestandards nice place for a beer also or spareribs, the food was very goodall and a pleasant change from our eastern diet of the week i had the 12
��, great ribs and other us style food drinks list is long but pricey on wine a more upmarket bardiner where families are welcome and is suitable for a casual business dinner too staff good and not pushy good location on 3rd floor of the village sanlitun family friendly with paper tablecloths and crayons given to kids to draw on them, after an overload of chinese food we decided we wanted a western meal and we just happened to be passing the union we were seated and served drinks quickly the atmosphere inside was reasonable but a bit quiet for a sunday night it was probably a good thing they had tvs on and music playing otherwise it would have been

��, our party of three had dinner at huang ting it was a saturday night and the place was nearly empty there were 3 other tables in addition to ours perhaps this may be attributed to the fact that the restaurant is located 2 levels below street level in the shopping arcadeit made for a somewhat odd ambiance although the interior
��,  ate at the restaurant one night whilst staying at the hotel  upscale vibe but relaxed atmosphere  good option for private dining  loved the unique interior design which harks back to old beijing  we had dim sum which was delicious ill be back, we ate here on our first night in beijing because we couldnt be bothered with finding a decent local restaurant it is located in the peninsula hotel two floors below the lobby we had peking duck and it was delicious the chef carves it in front of you as is the case with all restaurants in china wines are way
��, we have discovered it  again by accident went to the chanel store and they gave us some voucher from the hotel which sent us to the down floor and this restaurant very good chinese food even for those who are not chinese there are also thai food menu i would definitely will go back again, the restaurant is located in the shopping arcade of the peninsula hotel it is very spacious with the interior being classic chinese they have a dress code of smart casual and specially the wines are rather expensive so it is not a drop in spot for a snack and a beer the food was excellent and so were the wines
��, had the lunch tim sum not typical cantonese fare but close although i was told the chefs were from hkg an average eatry in hkg would serve much better quality of the same fare the decor was nice though service was like any four star hotel would try again just to see if it is any better, good dim sum in a very pretty dining room considering youre in a basement this is perhaps not quite as good as the best dim sum in hk but for beijing it is right up there with seventh son as the best in town, had dinner on december 24th there right upon our arrival in beijing the festive menu with 8 course was really excellent with various dishes matching all tastes the chicken soup being probably the most unusual also excellent value for money rmb 400 +tax per person, a hidden place for good cantonese food being at the basement of the hotel a little pricey and not many people which is quite nice for a business meeting where you can hear each other around the table we ordered 7 dishes for two people and the waiter was kind enough to inform that was sufficient though booking may not
��, we chose the restaurant in part for the decor which is nice but not as good as the website pictures went on a wednesday evening  were one of only two parties in the restaurant so the place felt a bit soulless as did the whole peninsula hotel to be honest food was creative and nice  just a shame

2,"black sesame is a must do in beijing for authentic and tasty food in a really unique environment with local chinese chefs cooking in front of you we had a fantastic evening, me and my partner went to black seasame kitchen and absolutely loved it we both loved having the set menu cooked in front of us it meant we could try new things and coco speaks very good english and takes time to explain each dish the fact it was communal made it very sociable and a good way to meet new people overall a great experience amazing food and coco is a wonderful host i would definitely return, the food is very very good and served in large quantities so there are a lot of good things to say about this place you sit around a table and meet people from all over the world which can be good or bad in itself i suppose but i will suggest two things to the place and a note to those who come there is a host and her name is coco she is very very nice but there is only one of her and two tables full of people she simply cant tend to everyone at both tables glasses were regularly empty plates that needed to replaced were not people had to ask repeatedly for these things which are often taken for granted at restaurants i think the place needs an assistant to coco and things would be fixed but until then be prepared to sit with an empty glass or waiting for coco to return the second smaller but somewhat related the alcohol policy is not clear they have wine and beer is also offered at the start but its not clear what is included and with the lack of attentiveness to an empty glass its not clear what path one should take i would like to suggest something much more simple like other places where alcohol is ordered and added to the bill for those who want it as it is some people want it and end up having to wait for coco to come refill when she gets a chance better to just place a bottle with the diner and let them manage, locating the hutong coco�s email with directions is very clear download a local mapping app to get to the �red wall hotel� and that puts you at the end of the alley or hutong go down the alley from the red wall hotel about 025 miles and coco�s gate is on the left side of the alley and has lights on it

arrivalhostess service coco greeted us warmly we were the first to arrive and she let us choose which of the two dining rooms we wanted we chose the dining room without the kitchen

overall dining experience coco and staff are generally gracious the meal is served family style in successive courses if you want a chair with a back arrive early so that you can select your seat otherwise late comers will end up with a less comfortable seat

is the price worth the experience bsk is highly ranked on tripadvisor but we think it�s overrated and overpriced if you�re comfortable getting around beijing on your own and not afraid then the price is not worth the experience we found fantastic comfortable highend restaurants with delicious food at much lower prices around beijing you�re paying for an experience and a name rather than just quality food also you�ll be seated family style with a bunch of yuppies our table included conceited german consultants rich housewives from the us and others after a few drinks some of the table guests were nearly insufferable

ambiance quaint and inviting like a family dinner table

service good service generally but refills of beverages could be better timed also coco refused to call a cab for anyone that seemed a bit odd it took us over 30 minutes wandering around the desolate streets near the hotung to get a cab back to our hotel after dinner

food don�t worry about the portions the food is plentiful and overall very good the best dishes included the spicy beef with hangzhou peppers the red braised pork belly chairman mao�s favorite food and dessert our ten course meal consisted of the following
1 pan fried dumplings pork and pumpkin
2 fried shitake mushrooms
3 beef with hangzhou peppers
4 fiveflavored eggplant
5 red braised pork hong shao rou
6 wok fried green beans
7 shelled shrimp with carrot and cucumber
8 sweet and sour lotus root
9 kung pao spicy chicken
10 candied sweet potato black sesame ice cream

cleanliness overall clean overall but not spotless

bathrooms there�s a small toilet room outside in the courtyard

misc bring cash to pay tipping is not expected we gave coco some extra and she neither acknowledged the gratuity nor thanked us, we had a fabulous meal here we found the restaurant on trip advisor and were not let down coco was a great hostess each dish perfectly cooked and served you need to book coco speaks excellent english however it is very tricky to find down a long back street with no sign in english on the door we had the set 10 course menu that was the only menu on offer and sat at a communal table this all worked very well we were served australian wine which was delicious too i would definatly visit here again, been at black sesame kitchen a few times now with friends we had enough people together to book the large table with the show kitchen and life cooking
great to see the food prepared life very tasty chinese great atmosphere and coco is a fantastic host
book in advance for larger groups and check when they have reservations for smaller groups and couples as bsk is a great place to connect with others visiting and living in beijing
the icecream in the end was the best, if you are planning to go here it is a must do you will need to book well in advance as it is so popular situated at no28 zhonglao hutong in a very old part of the city we discovered part of the restaurant was attached to the original city wall and several hundred years old
we arrive a little early and met a great lady coco who speaks great english which was good for us as i cannot speak chinese coco gave us a tour of the complex then went about setting up for the other guests we were lucky as when more guests arrived the other areas were closed off
once inside we were seated at a table for twelve but they managed to squeeze two more in
we sat near the preparation area and watched the chefs prepare and cook the food there was also a mirror above the chefs so every body could see the food being prepared
the meal was served in individual portions that were perfectly blended there is no fixed menu it depends what ever the chefs decide to cook on the day there was also international wine to be served with the meal we were told which was a treat but when they served it the was from a winery just 20 kilometres from where we live but very nice all the same we ate and chatted to people from all over the world and at 1000 pm coco phoned a taxi for us and were escorted through the hutong by one of the staff to the uber taxi point and set off home fat and fed
it was a great night and a fantastic experience well worth the cost, even i had been living in beijing for 3 months and i had tried over 40 restaurant in this city and many others in china i would rate this black sesame kitchen is the best one the food was excellent and the service was great fully recommend this place, we did the cooking class at lunch and had a blast our host cocoa was so friendly and super sweet we got to learn about traditional chinese cooking and even get tips on how to prepare it ourselves lunch was delicious and we loved the overall experience, if you want to have a lot of chinese food and watch how the chefs are making it this is the place to go the host is super nice and tell you stories about traditional china the place is pretty hard to find and there isnt any signs outside so take time to find the place, this place was one of the highlights of our trip to china and really made me appreciate chinese cuisine and ingredients a lot more
for 300 yuan you get to try 10 different dishes cooked right in front of you so you can ask questions and pick up some ideas for cooking at home
the host coco speaks great english and is lovely to chat to and the chef and his team are a treat to watch at work, we ate dinner here on our last night in beijing the 10 courses were all cooked right in front of us and they were by far the best food we had in beijing each course was better than the next we enjoyed talking with other tourists from all parts of the world since we shared one table definitely a very fun experience with great food and an informative host i would recommend taking a map to find it since it is in the residential area which is a little hard to drive in even for taxis highly recommend getting a reservation and enjoying the evening, black sesame is an amazing place with a great atmosphere fantastic food and free flowing drinks

the pork and ice cream are my favorites but all the dishes are amazing a great place to take family friends and colleagues for a special experience, first of all i am a chinese so i am very familiar with all those dishes they serve the food is nothing special or extraordinary however the dinning experience in a private kitchen in chinese courtyard is just very interesting they only serve 16 people every night the interaction between guests and host coco and the chef is very interesting to me besides wine is included in the dinner the price for this dinner is very affordable last but not least the dish that blows my mind away is the black sesame ice cream i had 3 scoops oops~ so good, what a hidden gem a truely remarkable experience the waitress was such a bubbly and lovely person she was a star some of the best food i have ever eaten, lived in beijing and loved visiting here we loved the food staff atmosphere etcit feels like dining in a persons home, this small 1 table location is a real treat for dinner open 2 nights a week and it seats 14 people all wine beer and a 10 course meal that you watch them prepare super friendly and equally delicious a great time meeting people from all over the world, it is difficult to add anything to the reviews which have preceded which have captured the uniqueness and charm of this eating experience although i understand the menu can vary here are the ten courses we were offered pan fried pumpkin  pork dumplings fried shitake mushrooms beef with hangzhou peppers fiveflavoured eggplant red braised pork wok fried green beans shelled shrimp with carrot  cucumber sweet and sour lotus root chongqing spicy chicken candied sweet potato  homemade black sesame ice cream every dish a delight with a couple being firey so beware if that is not your taste we were a group of 6 we loved every moment watching the chefs prepare the food conversing with newfound acquaintances next to us and listening to cocos explanations and comments if you have the opportunity make a date to visit black sesame you wont be disappointed, you need to get there with gps  1st tip we went without a reservation but i do not recommend that since it is a tasting food type of restaurante and everbody booked it in advance only 2 long tables  ours had only 10 people  we were very lucky because there had been 2 last minute cancellations and we could enjoy a 10course chinese meals from different parts of chine including an amazing dessert open bar for wine beer
both waiters were incredibly nice and attentive explaining the different dishes and even telling us how to cook them and the recipes ese were next to the cooks who worked in front of us in an open kitchen during the morning in this place u get cooking lessons and at night the teachers are the cooks you also get to speak to the people around u we personally had a really good night with our neighbours who were 3 funny and nice swedish people a 1010 experience really really recommend it, this restaurant located down a small alley and in a hutong lives up to it�s billing and then some as one of the best in beijing coco was a wonderful and gracious host and even let us give a couple of things a try in the kitchen ourselves we went on friday night to the group wine and dine dinner and loved it so much we sent our hiking friends there on monday when they got back into the city needless to say they fell in love with the place as well, thank you coco and team for a really fabulous evening an opportunity to eat freshly prepared chinese food in an excellent hutong setting good variety of dishes great wines and the company is what you make itcommunal dining at its best recipe books on sale would certainly go back fantastic way to end of a wonderful weekend in beijing, we werent sure what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised at how fun and interesting this dinner turned out to be bsk serves communal style dinners in a hutong courtyard with a prix fixe menu and wine pairings the food was really delicious authentic beijing cuisine paired with australian wines the company was really fun as its always fun to compare notes with fellow travelers while breaking bread coco the organizerproprietress was fabulous if you want a really unique experience and enjoy meeting fellow travelers this is a very fun way to spend an evening in beijing, most delicious and enjoyable evening with the 10 dishes and interesting people wed recommend to anyone wonderful staff led by coco and brendan, i was originally looking at black sesame for a cooking class but when i researched the communal dinner further i was sure this was for us located on a hutong or side alley finding this restaurant was a fun part of the experience we arrived a little early and had time to watch the chefs at work in the kitchen viewing their techniques we then sat down at a large table for the thirteen total guests who made up this group and were offered our choices of wine the dishes followed in rapid succession including dumplings five flavored eggplant red braised pork belly and other dishes completely satiated we were finally tempted with dessertblack sesame ice cream and candied bananas not only was this a great feast but it was also a wonderful social gathering of travelers from around the world why go out to a restaurant when you could be doing this instead, our good friend recommended that we try black sesame kitchen during our recent visit to beijing

it was a very interesting experience even though i have lived in beijing before the slow walk into the hutong with the crisp cool climate slightly dark as we try to anticipate the evening greeted by 2 red chinese lamps at the small entrance door

the food served up was typically homestyle beijing dishes some with a twist i enjoyed the eggplant beef  stewed pork dishes their homemade black sesame ice cream was heavenly

what made the evening more memorable was the excellent service the staff were one of the friendliest ive ever encountered always ready to make your evening better

all in all a fantastic first dinner in beijing worth coming back again, located in an alleyway near the forbidden city this gem of a restaurant provides for a truly unique dining experience communal dining a 10 course meal includes wine and beer coco the host is charming and delightful and within minutes you feel like you are dining with family fixed price of rmb 300 which is about us$45, after 2 weeks traveling around china we ended our fabulous stay at the black sesame kitchen what a send off as other reviewers have noted it is hard to find but we all did because coco sends an email with instructions in chinese so after we got out of the taxi we showed someone in the street the email and they pointed us in the right direction for the alley after walking a minute or so and wondering if we were in the right place we saw lights and two red lanterns outside and all was well the concept is great especially if you enjoy talking with people from around the world this place caters to travelers but we brought a local chinese friend who said the food was very authentic  very much what families would enjoy at home its not a restaurant  its literally a kitchen with a big communal table that seats around 1617 people i was sitting near 6 women from finland who come to beijing every year  this was their fifth time eating here do pace yourself as i was a bit too full to enjoy the last few dishes but the black sesame ice cream for dessert was to die for everything was delicious and i would highly recommend dining here, we booked a table for 7 via email the manager coco was articulate and clear in her communication in english we had a fantastic night served a 10 course meal each course made in front of you by the chefs its best to go as a group i feel as there is one huge table so going as a couple wouldnt be as easy the beer and wine was included in the cost rmb600 pp the hostess coco really does a great job of working the room without it feeling too staged the hutong has two large tables in rooms on either side of a courtyard its hard to find and there is no sign on the door you just have to find the alley and look for number 28 it should be noted that this food isnt michelin style its generally simple traditional chinese food from various provinces all done to perfection ending with their famous black sesame icecream a lovely evening had by all many thanks , great meal in beijing in october 10 course meal best meal i had in 3 weeks in china south korea and japan coco is unbelievable the restaurant only sits about 10 people very friendly atmosphere food incredible family style, visited 3 years ago since then the restaurant has changed location still a terrific evening great fooda set menu with 7 courses i had separate vegetarian courses when necessary best course is dessert as black sesame home made ice cream is superb, this dining experience wasnt what i expected as it was so much more and better the food was excellent and cooked right in front of the communal table quality of the dishes was what it should be given such a high ranking what was such a delightful addition to the experience was the feel that you are eating at a friends house there were three groups of people at our table and while cramped it didnt feel too stuffed the service was personable and efficient while i drank the wine i do wish they had liquor as an option but that is a small price to pay it was about$50 usd which was a bargain for what we got hard to find but well worth the effort a true must for anyone looking for a great dining experience in beijing, this was actually the best meals we had in china the food was incredible dumplings and sesame ice cream were a highlight but what really made the whole evening was coco and the team in the kitchen

you would definitely be missing out if you dont spend a good part of your evening chatting away with coco and other diners as its a communal table as she has a great wealth of knowledge on so many things and has a very sweet personality

we met some great people and we wont forget this evening for a while 

great value for money with around 78 courses and costs something like <u+00a3>30 per person including wine and beer, we had lunch at the black sesame kitchen yue the manager was outstanding in attending to the customers they had only 12 seats open for lunch and we my wife and i were there was another group of six koreans very cosy place with good range of dishes with free flowing wine enjoyed the kindness of yue i was surprised when she said we could consumer all the wine we wanted we told her that we were worried that the kitchen might go broke she mentioned that happy customers were very important for the restaurants a spirit that is rare among fb establishments, we went to black sesame kitchen after reading all of the great tripadvisor reviews and werent disappointed its hard to describe the experience other than comparing it to having an amazing dinner party at a good friends house black sesame kitchen is located on a secluded street very close to the forbidden city you literally eat in a kitchen with a large communal table that seats about 25 people who become your friends by the end of the night the days menu is on the blackboard and food keeps coming out 1 course at a time each course was amazing however even more amazing is the gracious hosts that run the restaurant i am in beijing about twice a year and this is a new must stop whenever i am in town, coco and the team make this a totally memorable experience on the night we ate there there were 12 people round the table and 5 different nationalities coco works to bring everyone together and we had a superb evening of food fun and conversation the food is superb and well presented we had 12 courses unlimited wine and beer and great company for 300yuan per head the meal is served in a room with just one table we all sit together and the atmosphere is highly convivial i would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting beijing, the black sesame kitchen is a place not to miss when visiting beijing we visited with family on a wednesday night and were able to eat in kitchen coco our host made the evening a fun event she explained each step well and engaged everyone in our party the food was amazing and watching it be prepared was so much fun we went on a recommendation and were a bit unnerved when walking down a dark alley at nightbut it was all worth it would so recommend to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, great experience  coco and brendan were very welcoming  we actually arrived early as we were so worried we would get lost based on numerous comments on tripadvisorhowever following cocos instructions which she sends with the confirmation email two days before your booking  we found it without a hitch it was great to be at the communal table and meet others from around the world  we were lucky to have great company the food is absolutely delicious  couldnt fault it  wine glass always full too  great value at 300 pp highly recommended, this is by far one of the best restaurants in the area for authentic food the server was very friendly and accommodating, we went to bsk on a wednesday night and had their communal dinner with six members coco was an amazing host and offered rare service in china she was able to explain the dishes provide wonderful conversation and also was very good with our kids ages 7  5 the chefs were wonderful and we ate in kitchen where we got to watch the food be prepared our friends told us about this place but was better the recommended if you dont each here while in beijing you are missing out must see attraction, my husband and i had dinner at black sesame kitchen and it definitely was a one of a kind experience finding the restaurant was a bit tricky but we managed to get there in the end the food was spectacular but even more so was cocos attention she explained every single dish to each one of us and made sure our wine glasses were never empty
besides the food the company was great the concept is very original and sitting in a long table with strangers made the experience much more special we definitely recommend this restaurant, i booked dinner at black sesame kitchen for my sister and i before travelling to china and im so glad i did

it was a little difficult to find but having received directions from coco our lovely host and with the help of some locals we were managed to find the right place

the experience was absolutely amazing coco was such an incredible host making sure that everyone at the dinner table was happy with their meal and drinks she made sure that the work good substitutes for me to considering me and my sister are vegetarians it was nice to dine with other travellers in an intimate setting

watching the cooks make your dinner was definitely a great way to spend the evening and the food was just excellent definitely worth it and should i return to beijing ill make sure to return to black sesame kitchen, we have been invited there from our relatives who lives in bejing in november 2015 beautiful location very familiar just one room with large table guests from all over the world having delicious dinner together it was a very interesting and beautiful evening with amazing food cooked in open kichen right in front of us everything freshly prepared with care there was a fix 7 plate menue with lots of chinese specialities very cordial host it was a perfect evening to recomend, wonderful chinese food restaurant
restaurant is situated in the dongcheng hutongs and has classic authentic hutong decor
two separate rooms each for 12 persons one room is with an open kitchen
at any time you can come and watch the dishes being prepared
this restaurant and private kitchen serves up one of the best communal dining experiences in town offer a 10course meal paired with freeflowing imported wine
i think if you come to beijing you should definitely visit this place, having stayed in beijing for almost 4 years i was introduced to black sesame kitchen by a friend and loved it  last week i took 3 of my other friends to this place and the love it too  coco the attendant was excellent she is so accomodative and gave me several options when i was trying to make reservations food and service was great and to top it all we met new friends travelling from australia london and california, if youre traveling to beijing particularly with a group or a few other people i highly recommend booking the cooking class plus dinner at black sesame

we went here as a group of friends and family and this was one of the highlights of my entire trip to china

the restaurant is located in one of the hutongs in beijing and the homestyle feeling of the space is incredibly charming we began the night with dumpling making class no cooking skills required

the host of the evening was incredibly friendly kind and attentive to everyone in our party note we were a group of english speakers and her english was excellent

after preparing dumplings which would later be cooked and served to us as part of our meal we moved to the dining room for dinner we could watch the cooks making each course and the preparation and cooking techniques would be explained as we went through each course the food was incredible we loved some of the dishes so much we were even able to get the recipes after the meal

i highly recommend spending an evening at sesame kitchen it was my favorite meal in beijing and one of the best activities of my trip to china, all 10 courses were amazing the staff was so friendly and nice we met so many interesting other people it was a bit tricky find with no sign but definitely worth it, i understand why this experience may have mixed reviews i was hesitating between 3 and 4 stars i gave it the 4 stars because of cocos personality and her arranging for my husband and i to have a mini dumpling cooking class before dinner the group we had really made this experience a good one they were all great conversationalists and we laughed a lot we actually ended up going to a bar after dinner with some of the people we met the food was ok besides the dumplings nothing else was exceptionally good in my opinion the other host who was in charge of pouring the red wine kept giving us about an ounce at a time it felt like he was trying to give us a little as possible that was a bit offsetting im glad we did it but im not sure that its worth the price it costs, this place is a tourist trap set up for non locals the communal dining experience is a nice chance to meet new people and the hostess coco is nice but its not worth the money the food is very soso and not tasty authentic local food that it is made out to be the price at y300 per head is more than double the price we paid for much tastier meals at other local beijing restaurants, a must do in beijing i stumbled upon this place randomly while searching the internet for night out in the hutong and i ended up getting a lot more than i expected this very cute place is actually your own restaurant for the night you will learn how to make your own dumplings and then youll be served a 10 course meal all delicious and authentic chinese food the staff and particularly the host coco is lovely and makes sure you have a great night her english is perfect the setting in a little courtyard in the heart of the hutongs couldnt be better go for it this was really the highlight of my 3 beijing trips, we did the communal dining option on our first day and we loved it it was a cosy and intimate intro into beijing  chinese history and good culture and we really appreciate cocos easy going nature and expire guidance about almost all things china we also got to swap war stories from fellow travellers from around the world in a communal setting which was great we also signed up for the cooking class but unfortunately that was canned because of a lack of interest overall the communal dining experience is one that shouldnt be missed","Beijing duck",0.999596167359606

��, we went for lunch and really didnt know what to expect but a beijing friend recommended it they have a pretty little courtyard that must be lovely in the warmer months we ordered a bottle of chilean merlot and then the food just started to arrive there is no menu to speak of  you get whatever is fresh and
��, like many americans i was a bit trepidatious about the food i was going to be faced with in china
��, although a bit difficult to find the search for the dali courtyard will be rewarding tucked into a courtyard off of a busy street the restaurant offers delicious food in a serene environment the courtyard is covered in winter and open in the summer for a meal prepared with pride be sure to try the dali courtyard, loved this cute restaurant set menu slightly pricey i am vegetarian so had a bit of an issue communicating this get google translate and even though my husband said he was non vegetarian i think they missed out sending us a few dishes that we saw others eating however the many dishes we did get were delicious and fresh good

��, this was the first restaurant we went to beijing after completing our 18 day moscow to beijing silk road train tour although a couple we were part of group of about 32 fellow travellers without someone knowledgeable i strongly suspect this would be a difficult restaurant to find its down a small alley and then has a small fairly nondescript

��, very good restaurant to taste food from the region of yunnan what is interesting is that you dont have the choice of the menu and the chief selects for you different plates that gives you the chance to discover many different flavors from this region the must is to go there for a dinner in summer and have a table

��, while visiting in beijing we enjoyed the asian food but it was a a real treat to enjoy some italian while staying at the st regis hotel fabulous food and great italian wines the manager and chef were very special too, if you travel in beijing and thought you couldn�t throw a nice plate of pasta and hit a decent italian place that delivers think again chef pietro at danielis brings an authentic and warmhearted slice of south more than your usual pizza and pasta pitstop this tried and true full service restaurant and bar has a tonguebending selection of antipasti

��, nice experience a dinner to remember ive tried the roast duck in a manner id never tried before very tasteful, i understand this was the place to go for peking duck in the 90s the place could use a renovation but still in pretty good shape the food was great one of the better peking ducks i have had the other food on the rotating table was also very taste so if you are now super conscious about a top
��, there are places where you can get beijing duck that is cheaper and just as good but there is none better this is a newer location that is beautifully decorated has an attentive staff and great food their signature roast duck is phenomenal but they also serve great fish and other dishes this is the most well known beijing duck
��, we had already tried one renowned establishment in beijing for roast duck and enjoyed it but had not been so impressed by the service so decided to try another our taxi driver suggested this branch of quanjude and it was really a great disappointment it was around 8 pmand there were no free tables in the main front dining area
��, if you like duck this is one of the few famous restaurant to try tradition and way of raising and preparing the duck is a great story food is ok and service is prompt clean and safe restaurant you need to experience it at least one day but i will not eat is regularly, its was 22 years ago when i moved to beijing for a 3 year stint as an expat and during that time i enjoyed many a meal at the quanjude duck restaurant having an opportunity to travel to beijing on business and to see my son who is now working in beijing it was the distant memories of beijing duck
��, the restaurant was upscale well decorated the service was quick attentive and friendly the duck did not disappoint it was indeed delicious and not greasy and priced right the other food items we got were fancy and pricey, great experience with a couple of chinese colleagues taking us through the menu for a duck lover this was great as were all the other dishes i would certainly go back, the place feels like a not so well run local joint the food is passable the duck is just ok
��, if you expect great peking duck  eat it in usa i was disappointed as i expected the duck in beijing to taste much better in chinese style restaurants in us the duck is much better it was close to impossible to figure out what side dishes to take and how everything is priced out, if you like big rooms bright lights and golden decor quanqude is exactly what you are looking for very traditional
��, wow this was a great meal featuring peking duck the duck is brought out whole and carved at the table

��, we enjoyed the famous pekingduck at chynna restaurant the service was friendly and attentative without being pushy or all over somewhat higher priced than other good places but the restaurant is beautifully decorated with original art very nice, we only dined one morning here a very busy  noisy restaurant with a lot of choices lovely veg juices available, the chynna serves chinese food very expensive considering the chineses standards but with the hilton quality, we had the peking duck one night while we were staying at the hotel while more expensive than some of the other places we went the duck was phenomenal, best peking duck ive eaten  note you need to give 1 hour notice so order before you arrive served with crispy skin lean breast and leg meat all on separate plates and 5 delicately flavoured pancakes like caraway etc good service and nice ambiance in the restaurant as well, i have had a lot of peking duck here in beijing but this was the best i have ever had next time i am in beijing i will have it here in addition the service was perfect, had a very productive business meeting while having dim sum one of my favourites the set lunches made it easy for all of us as we didnt need to spend too much time going through the menu, nice service great food huge selection  ate here a few times everything we ordered was yummy great service lovely atmosphere, a good option in the area flooded with tourists from far and near the place is quiet connected to the hotel bar and other hotel restaurants good quality cantonese cold and hot dishes the soup taste bland and at rmb75 it is not worth the money the dessert looked nice but taste average, we were in beijing only 4 nights and we ate here for three of them i loved the modern oversized decor and it was good value for good quality food the staff were very nice and the place was not crowded after a long and tiring and very hot days sightseeing  with kids in tow  it was good
��, for many westerners it is not all too easy to dine chinese in china chynna is a great choice of restaurant they serve classic authentic chinese food in a modern style what it means is that it all tastes great and that you avoid the worst dishes you dont want anyway if u know what i mean, there are better places to eat so do go explore but if you are tired and dont want to brave the streets of beijing if you are staying at the hilton or near by this is a good restaurant peking duck of course and a few other items kung po chicken noodle dishes and few vegetarian dishes if you so
��, often hotel restaurants are average and over priced if you dont order wine or crazy french water this restaurant wont disappoint beijing duck as exceptional and the attention to detail is excellent staff are friendly and for a high end gig the price of the dishes is reasonable both visits in the last year have been solid performances, we enjoyed a reasonably tasty meal here the setting is lovely the servers are very attentive think hovering but the absolutely insane thing was that for a large bottle of water i am talking about evian water not water that sings or does a dance or tells jokes  they charged $16 thats more than one of our appetizers and
��, we ate at chynna to experience the peking duck there it was very very good if want rice or a side dish thats extra but thats the way it is at most restaurants we ate at, we decided to eat here to experience a traditional peking duck dinner it was prefect the chefs prepares everything for you and tells you how to eat it the resturaunt its self was amazing  very traditional yet modern and romantic the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is lovely however i do encourage more people to visit as it
��, we stayed at hilton wangfujing for 6 nights and decided to try this hotel restaurant  it really is very well decorated service a bit too much attentive which makes one feel unconfortable but what really upset me was the incredible small amounts of food  furthermore food was only average expensive  and the restaurant almost empty which shows

��, ate breakfast here and didnt check the price first big mistake breakfast buffet was good but it cost 40 usd per person thats insaneit certainly was not $40 worth of good, my wife and i enjoyed lunch two times at the lunar 8 restaurant in the fairmont hotel in the chaoyang district of beijing the food was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly if you happen to be staying at the fairmont hotel this restaurant is a nice place for lunch, the pad thai was great the pork fried rice was superb the server was friendly and the food came quickly albeit the restaurant was pretty much empty not sure if its somewhere to go out of your way for but if youre close and you want something tasty its a great spot the price is reasonable especially considering what a
��, ate here on our first night in beijing fantastic super crazy expensive szechuan food astronomically over priced wine list like most of beijing meh on the service if your staying at the fairmont and your super set on eating chinese food near by this is the best option, restaurant cuisine in fairmont hotels are always overpriced but service is very good a comfortable choice after a long flight however servers dont speak much english food is presented nicely and is of average quality compared to north american fairmont restaurants, we had a decent meal but we paid $100 for the same quality of chinese food i can get back home around the corner from my apartment for about $20 despite the high reviews we knew something was amiss when we walked into the restaurant at prime time on a friday evening and only 5 of the 50 or so
��, as part of our tour our group we stayed at the beijing fairmont we ate at this buffet restaurant every morning for breakfast there were great choices  both eastern and western if you dont like the tunny scrambled eggs they put out they will make eggs almost any way you want one night we also ate dinner here and
��, we went for dinner late as per chinese time as a result all dishes were not available still whatever we eat was good wine collection was excellent and service was terrific  may be because restraint was empty and staff has no one lese to serve, we ate breakfast at lunar 8 everyday during our 4 day stay at the fairmont the hosthostess and wait staff are all extremely kind and attentive and the food is expansive and delicious both western and asian selections abound dinner at the restaurant is equally as good and while the menu has only chinese items they also have a small
��, ive been here a few times but always forgot to write reviews their duck is really good not as good
��, nice dinner menu but nothing special a bit disappointing for breakfast as service is slow and coffee ordinary, nice restaurant not as great as the cut choice was a bit limited but all the food was great especially the peking duck, i have lived in beijing for several years i love beijing duck and we eat it at least one a
��, superb food the chef that carved the duck was outstanding food was good service was attentive without being over the top a tad expensive, the shop is quite small compare to other shops and we were asked to change to seat in order to share the table with other people may be it is rush hour but it is make me feel uncomfortable and the most important is not so much choices on the buffet breakfast the price is quite expensive with the services
��, we were at the hotel so we had there our breakfast for that it was average in fact it was not great but for dinner is completely different specially talking about the peking duck simply great better than outside in the traditional restaurants, given a choice i generally do not eat chinese food however on this occasion the other restaurants were closed so we had dinner at the lunar 8 the food was the best chinese i have ever had the restaurant itself is modern and very accommodating the staff were attentive and polite overall a very good dining experience, i visited this restaurant twice during my stay for dinner as well as for breakfast the size of the restaurant is quite small hence during breakfast i was asked to share a table with some other guests there were basic stuff people could expect from a buffet breakfast however the options were fewer comparing with other 5 stars hotels in
��, we arrived that afternoon and asked about duck at the front desk they arranged for us to have dinner in their restaurant at the fairmont as we were tired from flights and we had heard the duck was great we were really pleased we had made this choice the service was excellent we were asked about some of our preferences
��, being used to splendid and some michelin  restaurants i am spoiled with good food all over the world then i visited the fairmont beijing hotel and of course the lunar restaurant what an excellent surprise having heard about the peking duck we went to have one unfortunately that was not possible unless reservations were made the duck is being
��, i love it its a great experience for me i had an wonderful time here in lunar 8everything was great staffs are worm sincere and the food was yummy unforgetable dining experience i will definitely coming back, this is a far better choice than cut which is also in the fairmont hotel there was a good selection of items on the menu and the food was quite good the restaurant is on the lower level and is large food was well prepared and presented the service was friendly and good dinner for two with wine was $165
��, nice ambience at lunar 8 and the duck was superb menu appealed to a wide range of tastes prices are
��, am a platinum member of fairmont and only expect the best from any restaurant at their locations this restaurant is a lot better service than the cut we enjoyed the mixed meals and a lot of choices at fair prices our guest were so happy that they wanted to return for dinner the service was great from start to end, came here with my partner while staying at the fairmont location and parking 45 in the business district bottom floor
��, i like the cozy atmosphere the friendly and attentive staff and most of all the varieties of food they serve, we were really tired our first night in beijing and intstrad of going to da dong for peking duck we went to lunar 8 since it was right in our hotel although the service was good it was a bit rushed and the peking duck was disappointing it was fine but not great in a city that should have outstanding
��, i was in beijing for three nights and on my last night i had the duck at lunar 8 it was awesome duck soup duck spring rolls duck fried rice and duck pancakes the chef came over and taught me how to use the chopsticks to roll the pancakes food was top of the line in every sense of the
��, ate at lunar 8 because we happened to be staying at the fairmont wow were we impressed we had the peking duck which was truly one of the best dishes i have ever had in my life and i consider myself a sophisticated diner and world traveler the restaurant has separate chefs for noodles duck etc i would highly recommended
��, the restaurant is in the fairmont hotel and we ate their twice myself my wife and my 3 kids 108 and 4 there was something for everyone and the peking duck was sensational i liked that you could see into the immaculate and spotless kitchen, while weve never been to japan this was the best sushi weve every eaten  freshly made delicate flavours and perfect cuts of meat all beautifully presented  a++, we have had peking duck at a few restaurants in beijing but lunar 8 serves the best one of all the ducks are roasted in the wood fire not gas fire that some of the other restaurants do if you are looking for authentic food in beijing this is the place to go the service was good everything we ordered
��, i was visiting friends in beijing and they took me here had a fantastic peking duck set meal at a really great value i have had the chance to go to all the  popular duck houses in beijing and the lunar8 is right there in taste and presentation but they are far ahead in value for dollar service was
��, we went with our son and we had a great experience the service was excellent and the food divine make sure you try the peking duck and the hand pulled noodles you also get to see how its done, lunar 8 at the fairmont beijing is probably the best restaurant in a hotel in beijing breakfast is excellent huge
��, make sure you get the housemade noodles and try their roast duck breakfasts were very good with western japanese and chinese stations, tons of options that change every day be sure to get a customized madetoorder omelette from the egg station, located in the basement level of the hotel it is a bit sad that this stair ant is often pretty empty mainly hotel guests as its one of the best that i often frequent when in beijing aside from the excellent buffet breakfast the menu consists of a variety of cuisines including chinese indian and japanese standout dishes are the
��, delicious sushi the sushi prawn tempura was exquisite, all the standards with asian twist loved the pumpkin pie dumplings and potstickers a better selection of cheese and coffee

��, i have been several times in this teppanyaki for birthdays or special gatherings it is always fun to come with a group of friends to have a nice and consistent dinner  the chef does anything you want sushis fried shrimp  fish  meat etc  while you sip several shots of hot sake  fun place to be
��, every thing was delicious  sushi sea food meat noodles all is so fresh and tasty and the atmosphere you drink and eat as much as you want the price is 35 dollars i will go back to this place for sure, food was great and the cook was awesome  i really enjoyed all kinds of beefs and sea food deserts were also great 200 yuan for everything is a bargain , tairyo teppanyaki is a chain restaurant and i have been to the shanghai branch several times so i was very happy to try this one the food was great and loads of it you pay a set price of rmb 228 which includes as much food and drink as you can consume the menu is varied and with pictures so
��, they know how to cook and grill their stuff well the menu has a wide selection of things you can choose this place is perfect for friend reunions or classmate reunions the san li tun branch one is not as good as the other ones summary good food great place to go with a big group of people, as locals publishers refer to it this is the benihana of beijing the place specializes in allyoucan eatdrink teppenyaki sashimi and sushi not bad for rmb 198, i love this place  either meat or fish the food is very delicious  have a cook who cook what you ordered in front of you is awesome  it is the place to go on every good occasion , they know how to cook meat they have a fantastic menu and high quality price is on the high side 238 rmb for all you can eat  however it is good value for that money the phoenix galleria is the best location sanlitun one is poor quality, the all you can eat menu for 198 rmb was the best food investment i ve ever made private chef in the middle of the table great so see how he creates the delicious fish and meat portions great to take pictures i was not aware that the drinks are also included  so was kind of greedy with drinking
��, very good place with very good food fish meat everything is cook just in front of you by a chinese cooker drinks are free when you order the allinmeal, thsi teppan restaurant has afixed price and you can order whatever you like including drinks  the food is wqute good considering the price and its great value for money  because of the value and fixed proce its a favorote for office parties so dont go for a romantic date, produce are poor and the money is being made bringing you as much poor alcohol as you want wreviews take ages to get the food pointless place knowing that for just a little more you can have prime teppenyaki in beijing, currently 228rmb for all you can eat and drink is pretty good value anywhere but when the food tastes this good and offers a range teppanyaki style meat and seafood from lamb to oysters you really cant go wrong","Japanese cuisine",0.945260079769275

��, stumbled upon this place on a whim unbeknownst to me this is possibly the best place for duck in beijing the memories of the > half hour wait slip away very quickly upon consuming the delicious duck that is quickly wheeled in cut up by your very own chef and placed before you wouldnt go anywhere else, a classic of classics many restaurants can bring good pekinese duck but quanjude has a real pekinese atmosphere in its
��, we are in private rooms which contains 2 big table approximately 20 people roast duck was nice other foods were also acceptable i could not remember exactly all the foods served that night as there are so many dishes ordered by the host waiters speaks little english hence we ask our colleague to order drinks etc for us in overall

3,"this is a good quality hotel clean and with good staff the price is reasonable except during the peak holiday times please note that it claims to have a bar but does not however there ia a small backpackers style bar directly opposite the front door very close to tianenmen square and to two metro stations, went with a friend food was so so for the price ambiance was great and dont remember the service so nothing special, we loved the food and servicesthe place is 5 stars to us it is a famous restaurant so i guess better to make reservation, i had a very different experience from previous posters both good and bad perspectives on the same issues first the quantity and value of food anyone who has had a tasting menu of this quality would never say this is not great value it is high quality food at a very reasonable price relative to other menus around the world sure beijing skews lower in prices overall but my comparison is more global as for quantity anyone with experience with tasting menus would never say this place is not enough food over the entire meal more than enough the second perspective concerns service here my experience is a negative take on previous reviews people have said the service is quick this is true too true with a tasting menu one shouldnt have three dishes on table at one time which is what we experienced slow down the service at a minimum let the diner finish the course they are eating before bringing a new one maybe even give them2 minutes between courses i appreciate that each course isnt 15 minutes apart like places but seriously we had 3 different courses on the table at one time slow down also they ask you do some strange things at the end of the meal like have your picture taken and write a note to whom i cant say just strange, the best dishes were bamboo dumplings avocado spring rolls eggplant  tofu and an indonesian curry but all of the portions were way too small for 3 of us with tea and a few other dishes i didnt mention the cost was cny 1368 about $200 usd and i left still hungry big disappointment but the atmosphere was amazing very nice classy place, we came to kings joy beijing for luncheon after going to the lama temple nearby we did not have a booking but were offered to wait in case a table became available we were served tea and a short while later a table having become available  luckily i advise booking in advance  we went for luncheon proper the venue is a place of beauty peaceful and stylish  have a look at the pictures two ladies were playing the harp and the cello which added to an already very pleasant atmosphere this is a wholly vegetarian place we tried a few dishes and all were delicious a bit expensive but well worth it go have a try  we warmly recommend it, food is just awesome
i was here with my friends and we had very nice experience
the staff is very quick in providing service food quality was just amazing
food price is high`but it value for itthe atmosphere and service awesome
one should try this place, this was a truly amazing vegetarian vegan experience since we were 6 they advised us to go for set menus our table chose 2 different set menus
as with every set menu a few dishes were not exactly what you would have chosen
however in general everything was of amazing quality and finesse the dishes were presented beautifully the flavours and consistencies were astonishing
i will definitely go back on my next trip in beijing
only negative comment they have an extensive wine list a bit boring if you are often in china => always the same however their staff have no clue you have to ask to taste the wine when you order a second bottle of the same wine they will not let one person taste it and just start pouring lots of improvement needed on that front and a more fun wine list, not cheap but by far one of the most perfect meals i have ever had the food the atmosphere and service reach almost perfection who would have thought vegetarian could be this good if you can afford it dont miss it, i don�t get it number one in beijing you are having a laugh for sure the venue is amazing but things go downhill once you actually sit down if you go i suggest you go inside swoon around a bit at the interiors take in the misty atmosphere and the scents wafting over from the lama temple and then leave with your wallet intact it is the only way you will come out on top we came as a couple and were seated initially at either end of an enormous table it was impossible for us to speak to each other in the end we had to move round to one side to get close enough for a conversation we ordered the food and the waiter gave us a sort of smug grin there was zero friendliness or welcoming attitude that is characteristic of trb � which i guess is their main rival for the top spot the wine was priced like we were in central london or new york i got a small beer for four to five times the price that i could get it elsewhere on the same street the food arrived and the portions were universally miniscule vegetarian food is not expensive to make even if you give people massive portions the prices here just bear no relation to what you get at the end of the meal we left 800 yuan worse off which is just ridiculous for vegetarian food in beijing and were so hungry that we actually did something i have never ever done before and that is to go immediately to another restaurant in this case �the veggie table� 200m up the hutong to have another meal to avoid disappointment rob a bank and eat before you go, if you only go to one vegetarian restaurant in your life make it this one it is expensive but you are worth it, the menu is all vegetarian but there are so many options that you dont even feel its lacking the food was tasty but a little spicy we got the dishes that were supposed to be not spicy at all for the little kids and they were still spicy the restaurant is very large and nicely done we had some live harp music while having dinner they had special plastic dishes and cutlery for the kids which was a really nice surprise the prices were a little high but we enjoyed the experience, my wife is a vegetarian she check on the ta and lead me to there if you are intresting about chinese tofu and the eastern favor you must trust this combine the chiese style and art togethere, truly fine dining for vegetarians the entire experience is what one expects from a five dining restaurant the staff is professional and friendly the dishes are prepared perfectly and plated beautifully ill definitely continue to visit when in beijing, the best place i ate in beijing i had a peppery crab that was out of this world i would definitely recommend it and the english here is decently translated, when you like mushrooms and tofu this is the best place to be quality of the food and experience excellent, must visit if you are a vegetrain nice atmosphere and live music played all the dishes were delicious i forgot my scarf and the staff run all the way to us almost 300 meters, this place is supercustomer friendly excellent food the price is higher than average would absolutely recommend it, best place to spend money the vegetarian menu offers differet sets from 500 to a thousandrmb and from the names it is hard to tell what you will need and when foods are delivered i have forgetten what i ordered anyway its pricy for sure quality is also good and you pay for the view too lovely place for afternoon tea as well recommend, as a pescatarian i was super pleased to find out about this place and experience it high end lovely wait staff good food, well tucked away in the hustle of the yonghegong we sat in the courtyard which was very airy and bright food was all well presented and fits with the atmosphere overall a great place if you like vegetarian food as far as vegetarian places go this definitely one of a kind note our second course was quite slow the manager came and apologised so we were assuming it was a hiccup, i must say half of the price that i have paid is for the setting the restaurant design is amazing first you enter through a chinese building doorway  and then there is this platform a mist as you walk along to get to the restaurant

inside it is truly beautiful modern but yet traditional chinese the tables are very nicely well spaced out the set menu ranges from $499$1299 rmb i went for the $699 set and it was already very good a lot of mushrooms used and well presented and taste is very good i felt full after eating but yet felt healthy

tea is not included but i do recommend to order a pot to share as they do have a really good chinese tea selection although some may think it is too extravagant to pay such a price for just tea, a spectacular evening from start to finish the ambiance and setting is sophisticated and elegant the service prompt informed and gracious the food is clearly based on well sourced fresh ingredients that are expertly handled and manipulated into otherworldly delights an experience to be had even if you are not vegetarian, my friend recommneded this vegetarian restruant and decided to give it a try
the decor and food quality presentation exceeded my expectation it turns out to be one of the best vegi restauraunts i have ever been to
there are a few set menus to choose from but all not cheap the set menu starts from rmb 300 to 900 per person and extra pot of tea costs about rmb 300 i would suppose an average meal would cost about rmb 800 per person
the restaurant is accomodated within a rennovated courtyard complex very modern decor its definitely worth to visit just to experience the setting and the food
highly recommended, from the minute you enter the building you know you are in for something special entirely vegetarian the food is extraordinary we have been vegetarians for over 30 years and this was the best food we have eaten we went for one of the tasting menus and can recommend each course was an adventure with both presentation and flavour each dish was explained when it arrived but although the service was very attentive it was perhaps too much so at times a place to go for a special occasion they have their own parking too a great bonus in that area, kings joy is a pleasure in every way it is located across the street from the lama temple borders a hutong and with pleasing architectural decor quietly accentuating its cuisine
the vegetarianvegan menu is itself a study in the expanse of plant base food sourcing and preparation techniques and i sincerely meant that in the best and not in an unappetizing way the food pleasingly presented is amazingly diverse in both taste and consistency from a subtle broth to an intensely textured mushroom steak this is a meal of both immense enjoyment and highly educational vegetarian dining one does not have to be vegetarian to appreciate the cuisine here, very expensive restaurant but worth this restaurant is high class and food is fresh very professional staff , the restaurant is very customer friendly
excellent food but at a price if you know it is expensive average 1000 rnb for a couple and bottle of wine then you will not be disappointed
really good atmosphere and the staff concentrate on providing excellent customer service
would recommend it, excellent comfortable design romantic atmosphere
wonderful service
no wonder the restaurant has so many awards even michelin star
the chef just a magician
all dishes are very tasty some dishes if i did not know in advance never would have thought that they were vegetarian
excellent wine list
obligatory place for all gourmets, this vegetarian restaurant is pricy nevertheless the food is great and what is greater is the atmosphere and the decor harp playing indoors dining options in the courtyard or the misty bamboo garden it is a nice experience, came for our anniversarysee the rose petals in a heart shapeand loved everything mushroom soup brewed for 12 hours foie gras not that interesting a mushroom steak that was so good i forgot to take a picture all i all a delicious meal beautifully plated and served, located next to yong he temple in a traditional yard different experience of vegetarian food really enjoyed it high recommend, bottom line come here knowing youll splurge then sit back to enjoy a fine dining experience

this vegetarian restaurant is a fantastic fine dining experience though no need to dress up or fuss to enjoy from the moment you come into the space you know something special awaits the twists and turns in the buildings design lead to a surprising and serene courtyard the chef mirrors that experience with the menugo for one of the set optionswhich provides only the most basic description of ingredients while the spices are a delight to discover

my experience at the restaurant was during lunch time at weekday which was quite busy the restaurant was bright and warm with sunlight coming in through the floor to ceiling windows of thew courtyard and streaming in overhead from the skylight above id expect that in the evening it would be amazing to eat hidden away in one of their semi private rooms or the courtyard

our set menu was fantastic though at 588rmb per person one would expect no less of the 10 dishes the best was the braised eggplant although the turnip cake and the water spinach were close to beat it out the textures were very well balanced throughout and executed so well that it was hard to believe we were eating healthy or vegetarian for that matter

they offer two beverage menus both of which are quite extensive and a glimpse into their wine cave backs it up we opted to stick with the house made nonalcoholic beverages and tried the lavender soymilk warm and tasty as well as the rose iced tea refreshingly sweet beverages will set you back about 70 rmb per glass so be aware

throughout the meal they had a harp and cello player offering live music which was a nice touch service was extremely attentivefrom the moment you come in throughout the meal and even wandering about the grounds of the restaurant

we noted that the restaurant offers a high teadim sum in the afternoon complete with pushcarts to let you choose options on sight would be nice to go back for that

overall a special place for a special occasion i would definitely go back after saving up again, the restaurant was recommended as very special and since we were looking for a vegetarian menu we walked there from our baochao hutong on the second night in beijing the entrance to the restaurant is somewhat hidden from the main street and the courtyard lit with ground level lights and mystical bursts of mist made it mysterious a large room with tables distributed on two or three levels we were seated facing a duo of young women dressed in white one playing the cello and the other a harp it was beautiful
a chandelier with five white candles was placed on our table and after we exploring the menu of unfamiliar offerings the candles on the tables were lit the electric lights th turned off  appetizers hot entrees including a soup with beans berries and greens floating a few dishes with ingredients we were familiar with different mushrooms and tofu  all were delicious including the deserts food is served designer style and in beautiful ceramic plates and bowls we drank green tea it was such a treat, we ate here because we wanted to try chinese fine dining the prices are really over the top so we expected to be blown away by the dishes we asked our waiter for advice of what to order and i followed it by ordering a bean curd starter and king pao mushroom dish for second however when my partner fried to order something from the menu not recommended by the waiter he simply said no i dont recommend that  we were not sure why the dish was not recommended but my partner ended up choosing another mushroom dish

we paid about 650 cny for one starter two
mains one beer and one glass of wine the bean curd starter was amazing but our other dishes were blend maybe we paid those high prices for having a harp and guitar show in the middle of the room or the candelabra that they lit and turned of all the lights in the restaurant if you want a really nice experience and are not on a budget then sure go here but if you expect to get food worth its price dont, its a great restaurant i really enjoy the view and the food here great experience the environment is super awesome, when i first went i thought this was a japanese restaurant im also not a fan of vegetarian food but since the place looked nice i decided to give it a try the food was excellent and delicious service was supreme and the environment is just amazing the feeling is almost euphoric i had a very good time at kingsjoy and i will definitely be returning would recommend to all friends and family 1010 , cuisine tastes good and surprising i will take my parents back forwards to share the exicited experience with them, we were looking for a place to eat after a visit to a buddhist temple and found this place next door it wasnt quite dinner time yet so we were seated to wait served lovely tea and given a book to read sorry a menu but what a menu it was every dish sounded delicious so it was very difficult to choose everything we tested was indeed delicious it is not the cheapest of restaurants for sure especially if you take wine the bill will be easily around 150 euros for two, i am so full and to think our meal was simply vegetables and soy meat it was a delicious meal the staff were also extremely accommodating which i appreciated if youre looking for great vegetarian food in beijing then this is a lovely stop, there are very few restaurants to combine elegance with style and health now in a bustling beijing city i would once again like to thank and congratulate kingsjoy on a spectacular year and efforts on continuous improvement not only on the menu but also with the entirety of the establishment once again a job well done and i very much enjoyed my time there, refined vegetarian food at its best in a perfectly elegant and relaxed setting it will be a regular stop when im in beijing, kingsjoy beijing was one of the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing restaurants i have ever been to the service was fast kind and of the upmost of respect and class the interior design of the restaurant is calming and very elegant and is accompanied by beautiful live harpists resulting in a very comfortable and relaxed meal the restaurant is very appropriate for special occasions business gatherings and casual eats with friends and family the vegetarian meals were not only full of flavour but very aesthetically pleasing as well definitely would come again, best vegetarian food ive ever had in my life food is as good as a michelin star restaurant definitely recommend it to everyone, every dish in the 12 course meal was a true masterpiece the presentation was worthy of a michlin three star place its hard to believe everything is vegetarian but it is this is nothing like your usual chinese vegetarian restaurant, this is certainly a fine dining experience with the price tag but totally worth it i am vegetarian and in beijing with the language barrier this place was like heaven we had a round table 7 of us food came out in time as not to over crowd the table the hostess polite spite good english and was able to recommend dishes based on diet the decor beautiful with mist coming from the floors in the center a harpist creating the most wonderful calming atmosphere definitely recommend this place near the llama temple, its an experienceand one of the best of our trip in beijing avoid if you are on a budget vegeterian vietnamise spring rolls is to die for the place is a heaven on earth dont miss the bathrooms i got this from conde nast traveller so thank you once cnt, my friend recommended to me it was a great place to have dinner with family i would definitely recommend to others the environment is nice too, coming here with family was one of the best decisions i have ever made this restaurant is spectacular from inside out top to bottom left to right the ambience  environment it gives off is indescribable as beijing is a high maintenance fast running city this restaurant really slows things down  allows you to enjoy your meal your surroundings  cherish time the food was delectable  the dessert was delicious accompanied with the wine served by the manager im guessing this meal was a+ as well as the service from the bar fruits biscuits enzyme juice and the service from the waiters everything was perfect highly recommended this restaurant definitely lives up to the price of its dishes ingredients are all organic  very much fresh i cannot stress how much i loved this restaurant kings joy you have my vote, this is one of my favourite restaurant visit here once in a while great food  awesome service definitely gonna visit here sooon ","cafe",0.999489533268454

��, we booked a private room for a business dinner the food was very well prepared and tasted excellent the price considering was very reasonable id definitely recommend the venue it was full at 8pm on a wed night so id recommend booking, have traveled to china numerous times i love peking duck this is by far the best i have ever had in addition the other dishes on the menu were authentic and perfectly prepared the service was great we ate there twice during our latest visit to beijing, loved the decor and watching the chefs at work in their open kitchens the staff were friendly and attentive and made some good recommendations for ordering as a solo diner it is usually pretty easy to over order to try different things so their advice was very helpful as i still had too much food left over they just automatically

��, the food was very good and delicious the service was fast and great they do have an english menu with pictures and also chinise names in it but you have to place your order to a chinese card where you have to thick which food you want we found this funny to finding the corresponding chinese characters matching from the
��, this place is very cheap and popular among chinese you will seen long lines of people waiting to get in unfortunately this place took over from another place that was called lapopo spicy grandma that i liked much better the food here is not bad quite diverse though standard chinese food but i will always miss lapopo which was one
��, this restaurant is on the 6th floor of a popular mall apm on wangfujing street its easy to find once youre on the floor because it always has a crowd outside it you really cant beat the quality for the price here it can be a little daunting getting a table if you do not speak any chinese but you
��, come early to avoid the crowd food is tasty and not expensive however menus are in chinese thus maybe challenge for westerner, we when there for dinner and order the bbq pork garlic shrimps the eggplants fried rice and drinks the food was awesome and super cheap i would definetly recomend it tough avoid the bbq pork as half of it is fat, wanted to try this place based on other reviews every night there was a queue to get in when we did get in we could see why there is a vast menu but be aware the menu in chinese and little english spoken there is a menu with pictures but there are so many when we did get food it
��, we loaded up on american cuisine after needing a break from chinese food wonderful people so good we came a second time easy to find when u get off the metro, you need to time your visit otherwise youll queue for a long time we went at 8pm and only queued for 20 minutes we ordered by looking at the photos and pointing it wasnt 100 successful as i didnt get what i thought id ordered but i think thats just because i wasnt too familiar with the food it was
��, we were curious as to why this place always had so many people waiting outside to get a table literally 3040 people everytime we walked past so we chanced it bad moveterrible customer service staff are unwelcoming and literally threw a menu at us and forgot about us for half an hour the menu is split into 4 sections which
��, enjoyed the food and ambience reasonably priced and a huge menu to choose from will certainly go back only snag is the long wait and queue as one cannot make a booking, dont be put off by the long queue we were told half hour wait but got a table in 15mins choice of foods is incredible english menus has less choice but has pictures very reasonable prices its busy so much so that they missed 1 of our dishes but we were full by then be warned its not a place
��, amazing food if you enjoy sichuan style cuisine so much choice on the menuits hard not to order more than needed though the staff didnt know english they tried hard to understand and help usvery sweet of them, we loved this restaurant so much that we went there twice yes you have to queue outside but it is inside a shopping centre and it is great fun listening to the numbers being called out the food was very fresh and very tasty we are quite cautious when choosing chinese food but we had an english menu and were
��, after reading traveller reviews we went to the grandmas dont expect anyone to speak english really you are likely to need to take a ticket and wait which sounds daunting but they know what they are doing i just signalled that i wanted a table for 2 they printed off a ticket with a number and then you just watch
��, this is a huge restaurant situated in a shopping mall it is necessary to get there before 6pm if you wish to avoid queuing around 30 minutes to get in that said if you go between 8pm and 9pm the restaurant is quieter and queueing is not necessary english menus with photos are available on request and once you have

��, we went to dinner here and enjoyed the variety of duck dishes as well other chinese dishs the resturant was very busy so lets you know it is good there are several chinese roasted duck resturant but this resturant frequented by locals so you know it good, we ate as a group of 12 on the top floor the room lacked atmosphere it just had 2 round tables and one small table where the chef carved the duck there was a selection of dishes plus the duck that was served with pancakes sauce onions and cucumber it wasnt quite as crispy as it is in uk so

��, would have given a 5 if i did not have a slightly better yet cheaper duck at another newer restaurant cant beat the atmosphere and authenticity tucked away in a hutong will be tough to recognise unless following lonely planet thrill of having a duck in a 100 year old establishment is the main draw, we visited on my first visit to beijing and would happily return simple decor in an old courtyard great duck and tasty side food put up with the basic surrounds just like anthony bourdain enjoy the price and feel full, i was lucky enough to be visiting beijing to see mandarin speaking friends so communication was easy in the restaurant the menu has pictures though so should be okay for those with a language barrier we were late for our reservation but were led to the seats outside until a table was free accompanied by beer we had the peking

��, this place serves some amazing duck its totally worth the price the atmosphere is interesting and feels authentic but the crowd when we visited was mostly foreign which makes it feel a bit touristy overall the staff is helpful and kind and the food did not disappoint, the restaurant is located between chongwemmen and qiamen of the metro located in a side road you have to walk a bit outside touristic spots but it is definetly worth it and you find it without problems with the location on tripavisor map it is a popular place to eat sometimes there are queue as a western maybe you are

we had to wait for 40 minutes the first time and 1 hour the next time i guess it is very common for this place so be prepared to wait we almost didnt want to the first time we were there but i guess they cant do faster the hostwelcoming waiter said sorry a lot of times and gave us a giftcard to one portion free vegetables

you can choose to walk around and come back at a decided time or wait in the waiting area both times we just decided to walk around and come back because there is so much to see on wangfujing street
but we could see that there was free drinks cold tea small snacks nutschips and you could ask for brickgames free shoe shining and a place to get your nails done but because we went for a walk we didnt use that and cannot say if it was goodbad

but once you get a table the food is excellent it is fun to try and the waiters are very serviceminded smiling and friendly even though it looked like we were the only nonchinese we felt us so welcome

the first time our personally waiter called for the welcoming waiter who could speak more english she helped us with the booking which was on an ipad also she guided us a bit through the hot potconcept
after a while we think the manager of the restaurant came and showed us the buffet of sauces fresh vegetables and fruit and how to mix them also she came with forks even though we didnt asked for them  but they could see we wasnt used to chopsticks so it was very kind of them

the waiters come by like every 5 minute but not to disturb just to check if everything is okay very nice because it is so nice to order more ask for something etc to the waiter also the waiter helped us with preparing the food etc when it was needed even though we didnt asked for it only a very few of the waiters spoke english but all the waiters were very friendly and kind and tried there best to understand us

we paid about 220 cny for 2 sprite 600 ml  which is what they call small  not danish sizes for soft drinks 1 portion small sausages 2 portion meat balls 1 portion pork slices and 1 portion vegetables to put in the pot enough for 2 people also you have the buffet of salad fruit and sauces a bottle of okay wine is about 50 cny very cheap compared to eating on restaurant in denmark

this is not traditionally chinese food but very good food and very good service and also a nice try if you are in beijing i would really recommend this but prepared to wait but it is worth waiting for, although i have had hotpots before wanted to try this because it was ranked 5 in beijing had to wait almost 45 minutes to find a seat they serve snacksdrinks it did not live up to the high expectation that we had the reason can be  visited a hotpot restaurant for the very first time without a chinese friend

staff was helpful in placing the order and food is not bad at all sichuan hotpot was very hoooooot, <u+7b2c><u+4e00><u+6b21><u+4f86><u+5403><u+6d77><u+5e95><u+6488><u+7528><u+9910><u+6642><u+9593><u+76f8><u+7576><u+591a><u+4eba>19<u+9ede><u+904e><u+4f86><u+7684><u+7b49><u+5019>1<u+5c0f><u+6642><u+5de6><u+53f3><u+7b49><u+5019><u+7684><u+540c><u+6642><u+670d><u+52d9><u+4eba><u+54e1><u+4e3b><u+52d5><u+63d0><u+4f9b><u+6c34><u+679c><u+3001><u+9ede><u+5fc3><u+3001><u+96f6><u+98df><u+53ca><u+6dbc><u+8336><u+65c1><u+908a><u+9084><u+6709><u+4e94><u+5b50><u+68cb><u+8b93><u+4f60><u+6253><u+767c><u+6642><u+9593><u+4e0d><u+6703><u+89ba><u+5f97><u+7b49><u+5019><u+6642><u+9593><u+5f88><u+7121><u+804a><u+5165><u+5ea7><u+5f8c><u+9ede><u+4e86><u+5e7e><u+9053><u+83dc><u+4f86><u+5403><u+89ba><u+5f97><u+90fd><u+9084><u+883b><u+68d2><u+7684><u+98df><u+6750><u+65b0><u+9bae><u+4efd><u+91cf><u+5145><u+8db3><u+6bd4><u+8f03><u+7279><u+5225><u+7684><u+662f><u+9084><u+6709><u+5eda><u+5e2b><u+73fe><u+5834><u+8868><u+6f14><u+62c9><u+9eb5><u+62c9><u+597d><u+99ac><u+4e0a><u+653e><u+4e0b><u+934b><u+716e><u+6eff><u+6709><u+8da3><u+7684><u+3002><u+5ec1><u+6240><u+5167><u+9664><u+6d17><u+624b><u+4e73><u+9084><u+6709><u+8b77><u+624b><u+4e73><u+6db2><u+6d17><u+5b8c><u+624b><u+65c1><u+908a><u+5de5><u+4f5c><u+4eba><u+54e1><u+6703><u+99ac><u+4e0a><u+905e><u+4e0a><u+64e6><u+624b><u+7d19><u+670d><u+52d9><u+771f><u+7684><u+5f88><u+5468><u+5230><u+6d77><u+5e95><u+6488><u+7684><u+670d><u+52d9><u+54c1><u+8cea><u+53ca><u+9910><u+9ede><u+6c34><u+6e96><u+771f><u+7684><u+5f88><u+9ad8><u+63a8><u+85a6><u+5927><u+5bb6><u+4f86><u+9019><u+908a><u+7528><u+9910><u+3002>, we went here for lunch it was excellent food with huge variety but have to mention their hospitality which is excellent pricing for the qtty given is reasonable too will surely visit them again if a fan of hotpot a must try you wont be disappointed, never been a big fan of chinese food but ended up liking this place a lot my bf ordered frogs and pigs brains i ended up eating tofu sweet potatoes and beef the spicy pot isnt that spicy if youre used to eating spicy foods ie indian thai

the service and atmosphere were outstanding even though we didnt speak any chinese our order was corrent and our waiter was very helpful, even if you dont know chinese you will manage to order and eat and enjoy the whole thing if you take your time
you choose how spicy one of the hot pot should be and the other one is non spicy you order meat and vegetables to out inside and wait and eat they will help you out if you havent been before and just relax and enjoy its great taste and good fun, a mustgo whilst youre in china you will definitely get the best hotpot experience in this restaurant while you wait for your table you can play board games and enjoy lots of snacks or you can get your nails done for free although the queue is insane for that as well
the service is impeccable they think of everything you get a kitchen apron to prevent the stains from crazy boiling hot pot waterproof bags for phones charges under the table elastic bands if you have long hair etc etc etc
the food is also tasty and diverse very impressed
highly recommended it, the restaurant is located at the 8th floor of the in 88 mall its the one with the prada store at the corner on wangfujing st it was recommended to us by friends to try hot pot while in china we located this restaurant which had positive reviews and it was conveniently located near our hotel we tried getting a reservation through our hotel but they do not accept reservations so we walked10mins over there around 730pm on a saturday evening and we got our names on the wlist  for an 1hr wait there is a small number of stuff who speak a little english and with the help of the googletranslate app we were able to understand eachother luckily when we were seated we were served by a very helpful englishspeaking waitress i cant tell if this happened by chance or by choice but she guided us through the details of this kind of eating she helped us order and she helped us pick the matching sauses for our picks basically in hotpot restaurants tables have a gasburning stove in the center where they place a hotpot then you order various meats fish or vegies which you boil in one of the soups the pot is divided in 2 or 4 parts each with a different soup mix it is often described as chinese fondue since i cant stand spicy food and one of the two soups was mildly spicy i eventually had to cook my items in the nonspicy soup it was a fun experience taking into consideration that we were travelling as a family with our 10yo child, abbiamo trovato questo favoloso ristorante frequentato in maggioranza da cinesi linglese come al solito e poco parlato ma i camerieri sono stati gentilissimi e nonostante le prime difficolta abbiamo mangiato molto bene scegli cosa vuoi mangiare hanno un menu con foto dei cibi non cotti e poi li cuoci al tuo tavolo scegliendo la zuppa base ottimi sia il pesce che la carne e le verdure un elogio allo staff gentilissimo e conto veramente basso, was nice to have food to order only half portion and able to cancel it if its not eaten lots of condiment is the plus as it adds more flavours to the food cooked like the kungfu noodles do infront of you fresh and tasty will come again some time was too full, un peu dattente une quinzaine de minutes pour 2 personnes quelques petites choses a manger en attendant le personnel est tres aimable et tres serviable nhesite pas a vous aider dans le choix des ingredients aliments de qualite service rapide les prix sont raisonnables pour la prestation la serveuse a meme offert un pot pourri a ma compagne en partant arrivez tot, this was a delicious meal the flavors were wonderful and the staff was very helpful despite the language barrier, <u+9019><u+88e1><u+7684><u+4eba><u+6c23><u+706b><u+934b><u+5e97> <u+8981><u+7b49><u+5019><u+4e00><u+500b><u+534a><u+5c0f><u+6642><u+624d><u+5165><u+5ea7><u+5728><u+7b49><u+5f85><u+5340><u+7b49><u+5019><u+6709><u+904a><u+6232><u+68cb><u+89e3><u+60b6><u+6709><u+4eba><u+6dfb><u+8336><u+9022><u+4e0a><u+5c0f><u+98df><u+5973><u+4eba><u+53ef><u+4ee5><u+514d><u+8cbb><u+4fee><u+7532><u+7b49><u+5230><u+5dee><u+4e0d><u+591a><u+5165><u+865f><u+7684><u+6642><u+5019><u+6709><u+4eba><u+4f86><u+63d0><u+9ede><u+4f60><u+7684><u+865f><u+5feb><u+5230><u+4e86>

they are apparently usually lined up quite a bit and the wait time can be hours long we did not experience that we waited about 10 minutes that was a bit unfortunate  because we did not get to enjoy the perks offered to waiting customers playing board games getting your nails done and your shoes shined true fact i put my name down for having my nails down at 1930 when we walked in and by the time we left the restaurant after our meal at 2115 there still were 4 people ahead of me on the list

when our turn came to get a table an english speaking staff came to get us and explain the menu and how to order however she really rushed us we had to ask her to stop and slow down numerous time we had not even taken our jackets off that she was showing us a digital menu on an ipad and saying you want this you want this one and this one we did not even really know what hot pot was and what the various options were and she was racing to put our order in though the ipad she was holding she meant well but it took away from our enjoyment a lot

all in all we had a delicious meal with more food that we needed for a total of 200rmb it was delicious although the rushing and atmosphere were definitely lacking they didnt ask if we wanted to start with a drink they did not leave us a minute to look at the menu they were even putting meat into the hot pot for us it was delicious but not the date night we had in mind

pros the perks for waiting customers the half portions for couples hot pot is more suited to large groups the price lots of staff ready to help whenever you need them the bib they give you to wear during the meal

cons the rush we felt like it was a fast food joint the way everything was ordered and delivered to the table in the blink of an eye and under pressure the smell on your clothes and hair after you leave the hot pot is built into the table it is not one of those beautiful copper ones that sits on top of the table like some other restaurants have

note there are various typesflavors of broth the spicy one is very spicy i tolerate spicy food very well but this was way above my enjoyment threshold
order noodles a boy will come to your table to stretch the noodles in some form of cirque du soleil performance you wont believe

if you want a relaxing atmosphere for a nice meal out this is not the place its best for large groups its loud and its very busy and stressful being there and ordering while they pressure you to make decisions very fast if you want to simply experience chinese hot pot and possibly enjoy the perks of the waiting lounge this is a good place, whether you like hot pepperspicy hot pot or just nospicy hot pot you should try any one of beijing haidilao restaurant translating to english  fetching the bottom of the ocean you can order a split soup base with both spicy and nonspicy mushroom soups and certainly try the prime ribeye slice australian lamp slices fish and tofu and other items as you like you can mix your own source or ask for help from the waitress all the stuff are well trained very high standard locally polite and helpful you can also pick up the fruits and congee as much as you like the locals love the restaurants as well be careful of your food allergy  point out this to the waitress here who can help you out the fresh made noodle is also a must  as the chef made the noodle on site, service was attentive but the layout feels cramped go early or much later to avoid the crowd wouldnt queue for it, i do not usually write reviews for food but had to in this case due to the warm hospitality i received while my family and i were there

we went on the eve of christmas we tried going on saturday previously but waited over an hour but the queue was not really moving my family and i were taken aback by the warm hospitality that we received at the restaurant  they provide food manicure services and other forms of entertainment to entertain you while you wait i would say that this is the first time that i have received such service before the staff there were very friendly especially one female staff ms <u+674e><u+6653><u+971e> who was particularly accommodating and patient

the food was served really quickly after we had ordered it we ordered mala its really very spicy even for the least spicy option and mushroom base must try we also ordered seafood meat and some vegetables to complete the meal free flow of sauces and tomatoes among other snacks are available

generally i would advice potential visitors to make a booking before they arrive as the queue can get really long ~2040 groups ahead of you otherwise visit the shop on the weekdays for a shorter queue, popular and can be a long wait but it is worth the wait they will give you snacks and a drink and board games while waiting food is great fresh and different siup base to choose from make your own combination of sauces, liked the place the concept and the service if you are from the west you must visit the place at least once while in beijing, fantastic food found it from trip advisor its on the top floor of in88 in wangfujing street easy to find we went there after visiting forbidden palace was cold and hungry we were so happy coz the food comes fast and the service was excellence no problem if you cant speak or read chinese the waitress was so helpful in explaining and suggesting dishes and portion for 3 of us wonderful experience will definitely go back the next time in beijing, we tried the twosided soup one with spicy numbing peppers and the other a white mushroom broth the lamb lotus root and bamboo were particularly good we followed the lead of other diners when making our sauces at the huge sauce bar and whatever it was we made it was great, this restaurant specialist in hot pot the restaurant is nice the service is nicelobe the soup so many choices and the seasonings sauce is so many choices too love the tomato soup, the service is very good and the food are also good just to many people and have to wait a long time, we ate here twice within our 5day trip wide variety of broth from which you could chose up to 4 the super spicy one is insanely spicy the mushroom broth is a must have as well we loved the idea of the variety of sauces provided where we could mix up our concoction the meat and vegetables were top quality we ate for 2 hours and chose almost everything from the menu the total bill was only cny 360 for 4 of us i hope they would open one in malaysia, first of all the food is simply delicious the sauce bar is unbelievable has many options so you can customize your hot pot sauce perfectly to your taste you will not leave hungry as in addition to the hot pot there are free snacks and fruit for before and after your meal sometimes there is a wait so they supply you with games snacks and drinks while you wait the customer service is really impeccable and this is somewhat of a rarity in china which makes is extra special, hai di lao merupakan resto yg memiliki banyak cabang di beijing menyajikan menu hot pot dengan berbagai pilihan kuah dan saus anda juga bisa memilih isi sup sesuai keinginan anda, after having some difficulties finding the place we found the entrance and from there since they saw we were tourists we got a lot of help and they gave us a table real quick and even though no body really spoke english we eventually understood each other and had a lot of fun
never were at a hotpot place before its really fun

��, the owner and staff were very friendly and served amazing coffee the toast sandwich for breakfast was a refreshing way to start the day the cafe gained my trust and we relied on them for restaurant suggestions and directions to points of interest in the city, probably the best mocha and toasted sandwich in china easily accessible and a nice quiet place to go after the rush of the forbidden city love your work guys, amazing coffee cute little shop great service english speakers too  very close to main tourist attractions of the city so definitely worth a visit oh and half the cost of starbucks, this tiny place produces some of the best coffee i have ever had definitely the best coffee i have drunk

��, our friend took us to this restaurant being in china for last 2 years i would say that i was pleasantly surprised to eat such a beautiful pakistani meal after a long time a little overpriced may be but in foreign land eating your countrys meal warrants a little payment i guess would recommend it to all my friends definitely, the location is good being in sanlitun but being hidden in an office tower makes it a pretty bland location staff were friendly and multilingual food is good and has a fair price atmosphere is average the design not brilliant but its a place where you can have a quiet meal, its tucked away on 4th floor of an office building in soho sanlitun getting there can be a bit tricky with lack of signs etc we had buffet lunch there it was cost and time effective if shopping at yashow market or village then one can come here for a quick cheap halal buffet lunch, great pakistaniindian food i know that there are not many choices for this type of food in beijing and i went over there to satisfy a craving for biryani it was so great that i ended up eating from there for the remaining two days i had in beijing get off at one station east of silk street yonganli at

��, i would say that lush offers one of the best western food menus in the wudaokou area it works very well for breakfast lunch dinner and latenight  afterparty supper burgers there are particularly tasty but also all the sandwiches the service might be slow sometimes recommended, half price breakfast from 810 menu includes omelettes pancakes and waffles as well as bagels really hit the spot great location near the wudokou subway station near tsinghua u also went there at night for happy hourbut thats another story, coming from canada for a long stay i knew i would need a safe haven from all the adventures of eating in china allelliuah i have never a better deluxe burger in my life the place has a leave your attitude at the door and just come relax attitude that is perfect for expats students and weary travellers from around
��, go between 8 and 10pm for some great happy hour deals also great is 30 yuan burgers from 1am and 3am  perfect for a postbender bite i go there on wednesday for pub quiz couldnt be in a better location, one of the best hamburgers ive had in the wudaokou area but im not into the party atmosphere we went around 8 pm and the restaurant was so dark and the music was so loud that i had to shout to talk to my friends, i lived in beijing for a month and lush provided a friendly place where i could get some food from home the food is pretty similar they have everything from pancakes to burgers they have free wifi with a vpn built right in so you can access facebook youtube and all the other banned things, lush is one of the most popular hangout places in beijing among teenagers this is the cafe where everybody knows and you know almost everybody there you can make friends with each other in ease and comfortable environment that is one of the reasons for the popularity of this place apart from this you will enjoy homemade dishes and drinks
��, perfect place for international youth  students to hangoutnice international music and service good place to find and make new friends perfect for every day visit and hangout with friends, this was my favorite place for lunch in wudaokou tasty sandwiches with french fries and drink for about 30 yuan then is perfect for studying or just chilling at noon in the evening is perfect for drinking a good cocktail  or a 1 l and 12 or long island in a giant cup  loved it, went there on wednesday night as we just got to a place near tsinghua university and needed some drinks to relax this place was very noisy as a couple of college kids ewere hosting puzzle night the cocktail drinks we ordered tasted almost like vergin fruit drinks maybe thats the way to cut down cost i cant just blame them
��, its such a university place its pretty much all students who go there they have fun nights like quiz and open mic they have really good frozen margaritas burgers and chicken tenders, lush caters to the university crowd that surrounds the wudaoko area of beijing and has been doing so for ten years they have an extensive menu and nothing ive tried has been sub par my favorite is the half sandwich i get the italian pesto stuff with the tomato basil soup but you cant go wrong really they also have

��, its one of the finest lounge bars in the city and of course the best in terms of view the panoramic 360 degree view one gets from the 88th floor of the tallest operational building in beijing is just fabulous on a clear day youll have a mesmerizing vista true to its shangrila reputation one gets some of the amazing
��, ive been to the bar and restaurant a few times to eat lunch and catch the city views during clear days however was mostly underwhelmed by the tepid reception and general indifference to foreigners over the next few visits it became clear that a large number of foreigners just visit to look at the views but dont want to eat
��, real nice place to watch the sunset you can order food or drinks and have a lovely time sharing a great view of beijing city i recomend to go before 6 pm to enjoy the sunlight cause in the night the smog does not allowed you to take a better look of the city, tried out because if its central location and as beijings tallest building not impressively furnished in a dull purple tone drinks and desert states below average standard max 3 star, wanted to see the bar with my own eyes and i was really impressed good decoraction tasty drinks professional and friendly staff and live music unfortunately the smog made it hard to enjoy the view fully, we stayed at the shangria la world summit for 4 days in september and used the bar quite a few times have to say not impressed whilst you cant fault the views hard to get wrong as its 80 floors up the service was poor who are these people you know when your in an expensive shop and you are
��, we came here in the evening for drinks and the view which is pretty spectacular you can sit right up against the windows and at 80 floors up theres a lot to see  as long as the weather is fine the drinks are a little pricey but what the heck its the 80 floors up that is the attraction

��, this is a good place to go for urban sightseeing weather permitting the prices for drinks are reasonable around 78 usd for a beer and 5060 usd for a bottle of pretty good wine if you consider that this in downtown beijing shangrila chain and 80th floor down by the street level you pay 20 but see 0 the service

��, located on the 80th floor of the shangrila summit tower atmosphere bar is the highest altitude bar in beijing offering outstanding views of the the city skyline the drinks are expertly prepared and served there is usually live entertainment in the eveing hours expect excellent service, a must do whilst in beijing  great views of the city and not as expensive as it could be given that its located on the 80th floor of the china world tower beers around 80 cny soft drinks around 50 cny, looking for a sky bar then this one hits the spot with the afternoon tea a highlight we spent around 5 hours 38 on a sunday with friends and had a wonderful experience the food was exceptional especially the cakes and desserts  very large  varied selection with plenty of savoury options too service was good for beijing but
��, poorly designed and function so much potential for being on the roof of beijing disappointing and closes way too early, you have to go here and have a drink or two at the bar 80 stories up and the views are amazing drinks are a little pricy but staff are great live house band each night and the spring rolls are a must, reasonable value food and enjoy the highest view in beijing if you are lucky enough and no pm 25 at all you can see the forbidden city from the bar directly, its a pretty fancy place here so dress up a little but if youre out and about you are still welcome we were in leggings sneakers and jackets as we had walked around all day and they still let us in and treated us great remember that if there is a group you should make reservations if not be prepared
��, on a nice day fantastic view had afternoon tea and some cocktails for sunset was great service not to bad bit slow cocktails very well made, tried a sandwich and it was very good nice setting and ambiance quite expensive though well not that much if you consider the price in the surrounding area, worth a late night drink if there is no pollution because the views will be good it is expensive so dont stay for too many drinks, fabulous food fantastic views service was fast and friendly waiters would thoroughly recommend it for the ambient music and atmosphere, location beautiful 80 floor ie tallest in beijing list of liquors top notch with reasonable pricing i would prefer more light and live music more punchy but for relax is a top spot recommended if you are in town, you can see on your own how luxury part of chinese people lives many young people music and drinks open night long, nice visit to the bar on top of beijings tallest building we enjoyed the great cocktails they serve the only

��, if you want to rise above the streets of beijing for a couple of cocktails then head for the china world tower and take the express elevator to the 80th floor the atmosphere bar has some of the oddest combination cocktails i have ever had combining whisky and wine green tea and vodka and throwing in dry ice for fun
��, buzzy stylish bar we had afternoon tea which was delicious and just right portion wise as we were lucky enough to have a window seat we decided to stay on and watch the sun go down and the city become alive stunning views and well priced all considered best bar i found in beijing, atmosphere is an amazing bar the view is very impressive the service is five star the prices are fair and anytime that i have guests come to visit me in beijing i take them here i will certainly be back many times in the near future, if you want to have romantic date or just relax with friends i think this is good place to go music is good and service nice the best is ofcorse the view you get and feeling that you are top of the beijing  always like to come here time to time with my husband, as a bar this is one of my favorites in beijing it has class great beverage selection live band and very good snacks they know how to prepare your beverages  cocktails like not many other bars in beijing additionally you great views in clear days service is the only down part from the bar since they are extremely busy

5,"there are a lot of yunnan places in beijing but this is one of my favorite do not expect luxury ambient it is really cool and local the food super spicy and amazing the only bad point is the location far away from the bar area and its difficult to find taxias always if you are a foreigner, from a bonafide meateaterignore any western sensibilities and typical meat trimmingenjoy the most delicious melt in the mouth and tasty fat where applicableim sure there are plenty of vegetarian options as well along with gorgeous flavours i can only add to all the positive comments about this restaurant im glad we made the effort to find this placethe tastiest food we had during our stay in beijing, little yunnan is tucked away amidst the hustle and bustle of beijing  we arrived on a cold  snowy afternoon to a warm welcome and excellent food and atmosphere  ask for across the bridge noodles  its not on the menu we sampled many dishes and loved this big bowl of broth along with fried goats cheese and delicious mushrooms  well worth a visit , we have just had a fabulous meal all the dishes cooked beautifully very flavoursome and the meat tender a very cosy place with locals and westerners
a winner for anyone visiting beijing, cosy place in beijing center not far from forbidden city eastern walls that offers a very nice atmosphere and very good food one of the best tried in china through my ten days trip, first night in beijing after reading reviews before we arrived in beijing we were set on trying here
and it did not disappoint

beautiful fresh food we might even return before heading back, we visited little yunnan on christmas the food was amazing i especially loved the fried mushrooms with cold bamboo shoots my 3 year old couldnt get enough of the deep fried mushrooms as well prices are very reasonable and they even have locally made rice milk wine this place is a must visit on any trip to beijing, a small courtyard house about 300 years old contains little yunnan which in itself is a great experience add to that a warm and welcoming staff  we were looked after by lewis whos english is excellent and then comes the oh so tasty food not one of the dishes we ordered disappointed we were especially taken with the pineapple sticky rice and the house made rice wine
at the end of our meal lewis called us a cab and saw us safely inside
it was a wonderful evening and one we will cherish, went for lunch after the forbidden city nice and easy to find spot waitstaff there spoke very little english but didnt matter as menu is clearly marked with pictures and english i got spare ribs hot and sour soup and lemongrass teaall with a bit of spice and delicious a nice pick up after a morning of wandering around, we went
to this restaurant that was close to our hotel good comments on tripadvisor and recommended by lonely planet great decor and cosy atmosphere service in good english by the manager we had quite good dishes although we ordered too much for two the yunnan dishes are spicy so be prepared for hot food a good option in this area, the english speaking staff member tried his best to give us a table even tough we didnt made reservations the atmosphere and interior are laid back and very cosy we ordered a very good cocktail little yunnan pink lady the food was also very delicious english translations on the menu only downside the toilet is not western, we ate lunch here after exploring the forbidden city it�s a nice little spot to rest after all that walking the dishes we ordered were a little on the spicy side we ordered green beans and a beef dish we also got the fried spring rolls which were decent but it came with ketchup as a dipping sauce good food overall they also take credit card visa, across the street from bike beijing and we had a late lunch after our ride loved the tilapia and mint salad, went twice in evening can recommend the chicken in potato hot pot to share between 2 people possibly 3 great choice of food english menus and great place to eat, we have in little yunan for dinner
excellent food and atmosphere the food is relative spicy still moderate dishes can be foundlevel of service is great and friendly english speaking staff makes life for non chinese easier good value for money, located a short walk from the forbidden city it was cozy and the food was great the prices were very reasonable, at the recommendation of the lonely planet we decided to check this place out and so glad we did the food was delicious the beer was cold and the staff were lovely will definitely come here again when i next visit beijing, my travel style is to wander and explore narrow alleys and places wo tour leaders with poles and flags this is how i found this wonderful local restaurant
ample menu in english friendly english speaking staff and great cds playing they had my playlist lol
i had stir fried preserved lotus roots delicious, visited this resturant with friends taxi was unable to find so was 30 min late to booking however still allowed to be seated sat up on a table in an attic sort of setup staff brought food all was very nice  drinks were also amazing would definitely eat there again, we stumbled across this restaurant due to the rain and very glad we did very rustic inside staff speak a little english and menu and communication was easy we had a chicken dish spring rolls and rice with a couple of drinks the food was very nice and cost less then 10 pounds for everything which is amazing would deffo return and highly recommended, went here with a friend on recommendation of another friend great patioish atmosphere good service especially given our language barrier with wellpriced huge meals just order a sampling of a bunch of things that sound good and try a taste of beijing, everything was delicious rustic and reasonable try the chicken and potato stir fry and the fried prawns, great place to eat very nice atmosphere very good food lots of it and interesting dishes service was good value for money was excellent, great little restaurant really pretty surroundings good food staffowners are very friendly and speak decent english, the food was not very tasty it was oily and gummy it is cleaner than regular places without being the most clean place in a restaurant the food is also very important, we have been there twicethe ambient of the restaurant is very nice  chinese with a touch of indie the food is chinese cousins with a touch of raffinate western influence the mint salad is superb as well as the ribs served with spicy powder mixed with webs to dig the rib in we tried a number of other different plates  all very interesting one of the best restaurants we experienced in beijing, visited this restaurant last month and thoroughly enjoyed it the food was absolutely delicious the staff friendly and the interior very welcoming highly recommended, the atmosphere the service and the food were excellent  we were there with two kids and spent wonderful time, i have eaten in this place during my visit to beijing and would recommend you to do the same however the place gets really crowded and given the huge amount of tourists they get id say the place isnt as authentic as it could be it does feel a bit touristy, as first time in beijing as tourists this place was our favorite one the food is great and so tasty staff is nice and some of them speak a perfect english perfect place to have a great yunnan dinner in town, this restaurant is great because you can really taste food coming from yunnan in a nice atmosphere the place is pleasant with some interesting pictures from old beijing and the food is very good dont hesitate to taste many different plates as they are all good but of course kind of spicy too be careful, cosy place with little roof windows through which the sunlight came in for two people we ordered chili tofu jasmine flower egg wok jasmine flower rice and sweet sticky rice with pineapple all of which were fresh and super tasty for a total of 102 yuan and i felt we ate quite a lot good meatfree options

we were alone in the restaurant at around 1500 for some reason one of the staff hovered a few feet away taking pictures i think of us for like 510 min without saying anything which made me feel a little uncomfortable so one star off for that but id still come back for the food , the place is small so it may be hard to get a table the restaurant has a cool vibe the food is good and the price is fair, cozy atmosphere and great food nice price as well the owner also helped us get a taxi back to our hotel great service, super service and choice of food only photo is an empty plate  delicious the drinks are refreshing nice setting inside with tables for four, we followed a recommendation for this place and it didnt disappoint it was easy to find with a clear english sign the menu also has everything in english and the staff were very helpful

they had lots of dishes we went for one each and some rice the portions were so big though we could have shared

two mains rice 2 cokes a beer and a cocktail came to 154cny <u+00a3>17

great, one of the best place ever yunnan cuisine is a mix between classic chinese and tropical cuisine you can eat different and mixed tastes as beef with mint rice cooked in ananas pressed rice in banana leaves pomegranate leaves salads fried sheep cheeseand rice wine
the location is cosy decorated with flowers and they are really kind  even the menu is also in english

its near the northern gate of the forbidden city you have to try this restaurant it was my best experience in beijing i can still feel the taste now, we have had dinner at this place the food is excellent and we have had dinner already at several other places in beijing the staff speaks english and is very friendly and helpfull after dinner they took time to help us with locations of eg massage salons calling them etc

definitily go to this place for delicious food, we entered the restaurant in the late afternoon and were welcome by some unmotivated service personnel we were very unsure if this place is worth to stay but decided give it a try and ordered the meal
after getting the different orders the situation changed completely amazing taste every meal had its own special experience an outstanding performance of the cook

normally 5 stars but minus 1 for the service, very nice food there is a lot of choice a nice place typicaly chinees decoration friendly staff price is ok, the food was good we especially liked the salad made with mint leaves some dishes such as tofu in banana leaves were more undistinguished services was quick and helpful and the servants spoke understandable english upon leaving the servant asked us for a good review at tripadvisor which really put me off please let customers decide whether they want to review something and what to write, i would highly recommend little yunnan to everyone  brilliant food in a lovely setting and some of the most wonderful service you can imagine after an adventurous trip to our hotel our driver dropped us off at the wrong place with all our luggage our large group was looking for what become known as linner late lunchearly dinner and not only did little yunnan look after our weary heads and hungry stomachs but also took in our large group of 9 with ease the staff owner and his wife were extremely warm and friendly and all of the food fantastic and plentiful  highly recommended, we had dinner here and really enjoyed it very lively place nicely decorated friendly and helpful staff and most of all really good food would definitely go back, my daughter and i visited on our last night in beijing after reading the trip advisor reviews and were not disappointed the food service and lovely authentic decor made this a really memorable meal highly recommended, visited little yunnan with my teenage daughters and husband whilst holidaying in beijing what a find  lovely helpful staff absolutely gorgeous food  so delicious and creative ingredients they look after you so well and make you feel special, neat food in local settingspure chinese setting i went there a few days ago with a group of four we where the only europeans when we arrived and got a few friendly laughs for our lag of knowledge of customs

the food is transnational chinese from what i gather it was all good and authentic + tasty spicy but not too spicy this is a must if you want to go to a place where more chinese turist come

the staff is friendly but are poor at english we barely got a reservation through but manged to in english you might want to get your hotel to make a reservation for you as the place is popular, went to check out the rave reviews of little yunnan and honestly it didnt disappoint i would say the mint beef salad is one of the most amazing combination of flavors in a dish ive almost nearly tasted go just to try this dish alone the wait staff is nice and decor homey but really  try the mint beef salad you wont be disappointed in the sauce and combination of mint and beef, i love the food here worth the trip from the uk just to eat here friendly staff and the most delicious chinese food i have ever had, very cute place on a quiet street food was absolutely amazing i had the mint salad and crispy whole fish ive been in beijing for a week and this was my favorite meal menu has pictures and also is in english one staff member spoke very good english, we went here after a bike ride through beijing on a very hot day its a small place with tables and chairs close together making it easy to review the food on the other tables

��, light flavorful dishes served in a beautifully renovated hutong tucked away off the busy streets nice selection of flavorful salads entrees and wines loved the fresh spring rolls definitely a favorite of ours since moving to beijing cant wait to return, you have to venture down a long and slightly dodgy alley hutong to find this place but it is so worth it susu is a warm and lovely little vietnamese restaurant with incredible pho which we enjoyed with spring rolls and chili lemongrass chicken for lunch they have a nice wine list as well and a pretty courtyard in the

��, we had a light lunch the food was very good menu was in english so easy to follow staff were very attentive and polite what more could you ask for, very charming restaurant hidden in the hutongs food is very good but prices are on the high side however definitely worth a visit when in beijing firstly you will get fabulous vienamese fusion food secondly you will get to be amazed by the hutongs and the typical local life that goes on there thirdly the inner courtyard style eatery has

��, visited last year and absolutely loved it they have moved locations and the new location only offers a small area for indoor seating we sat outside they had ample umbrellas so this helped with the heat the food was ok at best all of it seemed to have a funny aftertaste didnt taste like authentic texas bbq, after tims original place was shut down due to the landlord not renewing the lease he managed to open up a small place in central park and now he has a bigger and better place in wang jing yes there have been some consistency issues through all this turmoil but i am impressed at the return to the high quality

��, i was looking for something nonchinese to eat and this place as close to my hotel grand millennium  2 minute walk so decided to check it out food was good though fries undercooked and beers ok carlsberg was all they had on tap that night worth a visit if you are close by, the owner looks like hank from breaking bad and is a helluva nice guy the house band is a filipino couple with an incredible repertoire we requested four strong winds and she owned it the food is as good as any bbq ive had in texas, its moved from and is now about one tenth the size one of the attractions of the previous site was the country and western duo the dart board and lively atmosphere and of course the food its now in a small anoymous box in one of the new buildings around central park it table has seating for about 10 yes
��, this place was great though hard to find the bbq ribs were very good especially for bbq in china nicely smoked and flavorful their sauce was outstandingslightly spicy and not too sweet the potato salad was similarly really good more flavorful than the typical mayomustard potato salad nicely spiced great consistency has some celery and onion crunch potatoes cooked to

��, if you want breath a little of texas bar style you need go to this restaurant its located about 2 squares of silk market they have a good list of beers to try and the dishes are wellprepared and tasteful if you have time you can play darts while they prepare your food, i visit tims regularly when im in beijing the last visit was unsatisfactory as they had lost power for a long time the food was uneven however i was very pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was open and the burrito platter i had was very tasty, within a 5 minute walk from the silk market this unassuming restaurant actually delivers what the sign says bbq 
��, this was a great surprise while visiting beijing on business after several days of traditional chinese food it was great to find a real american restaurant the food was truly texan cuisine lots of great beers too i highly recommend this restaurant, food is ok maybe a real bbq lover would be left disappointed but i loved the taste of home after a week of interesting food friday night music great beer selection a bit limited decor excellent overall a good place to have a nice meal relax and enjoy the interesting mix of east meets west continued good luck tim, we passed there very hungry and looking for a nonchinese lunch and we had a great time with good food

��, after living in china for a few months we needed to have a little taste of home this place was good and had many western specialties like baked beans cole slaw taco salad and even diet coke which is pretty unheard of in china service was good price was reasonable and portions ample would definitely return, a pretty fun place to for americans in china reminds me of texas and they have pretty decent bbq their burgers on the other hand are excellent probably the best burger i have had in china definitely worth going to check out also their staff speaks very good english for the most part they also have many types of beers

6,"ive been craving dumplings ever since my husband and i arrived in china but vegetarian fillings are hard to come by we joined joyces cooking class yesterday evening where i was able to make my very own vegetarian dumplings with minced tofu shitaki mushroom celery and glass noodles joyce was a great host and welcomed us with traditional chinese tea seasonal fruits and snacks she gave us stepbystep instructions was patient with all of our questions and humoured us as we tried to learn the proper folding techniques we had dinner together and chatted as if we were old friends sharing stories from our different countries and cultures definitely the highlight of our time in beijing, we wanted a bit more of a relaxed night for our final night in beijing this class was exactly what we needed
joyce arranged such an easy spot to meet us and from there just a quick walk to the kitchen she gave us some delicious lunar new year treats as well as fresh fruit and delicious tea to get us settled in then she brought out all the ingredients for us and explained and demonstrated what we needed to do our dumplings and noodles were delicious will need a bit more work when we make them at home to perfect the shape haha the food was fresh a lovely environment and joyce was an absolute pleasure to meet
would highly recommend this class for anyone after a relaxed night but still wanting to experience chinese culture loved it, we were looking for something unique to do after a few action packed days in beijing we reserved a lunch session with joyce for our group 4 adults and 3 kids from the moment we arrived we felt very welcomed and a part of the action she walked us through how to make the dumplings and noodles and took time to explain all of the spices and ingredients she was very interactive with our kids and they never once seemed bored or disinterested

the entire process was an absolute blast i think this will definitely be up there for one of our top memories in beijing i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun way to spend some time have a few drinks learn how to make food and then best of all enjoy the meal, i have found joyce kitchen by accident while having a walk through the hutongs next to the lama temple and was very happy i did i joined a cooking class and besides learning how to make dumplings with three different fillings i got to know many stories and products of the traditional chinese cuisine and cooking culture as the class was in english and the hostess joyce told us many interesting things you only can learn from real chinese people the two other cooking class students were from other countries so it was also a great intercultural experience we laughed a lot trying our best imitating the skilful technique of folding the dumplings the right way showed by joyce but in the end our boiled and fried dumplings as well as the long chinese noodles have been very delicious after dinner we tried some of the nuoyan rice wine which we liked a lot so that joyce invited us to join the nuoyan rice wine tasting at a special wine house the next day also a unique and great experience i would recommend i really enjoyed this weekend, <u+5317><u+4eac><u+306e><u+80e1><u+540c><u+306b><u+3042><u+308b><u+4f1d><u+7d71><u+7684><u+306a><u+5bb6><u+3067><u+672c><u+683c><u+7684><u+306a><u+9903><u+5b50><u+306e><u+4f5c><u+308a><u+65b9><u+3084><u+9eba><u+306e><u+6253><u+3061><u+65b9><u+3092><u+6559><u+308f><u+3063><u+305f><u+308a><u+98df><u+3079><u+305f><u+308a><u+3067><u+304d><u+308b><u+30d7><u+30ed><u+30b0><u+30e9><u+30e0><u+3067><u+3059><u+3002><u+6570><u+7a2e><u+985e><u+306e><u+9921><u+3092><u+6559><u+3048><u+3066><u+304f><u+308c><u+3066><u+3001><u+7279><u+306b><u+76ae><u+306e><u+4f5c><u+308a><u+65b9><u+3084><u+4e2d><u+56fd><u+5f0f><u+306e><u+5305><u+307f><u+65b9><u+306a><u+3069><u+6559><u+308f><u+308c><u+3066><u+5927><u+5909><u+70ba><u+306b><u+306a><u+308a><u+307e><u+3057><u+305f><u+3002>, what a great break from busy touring it was to spend time with joyce in her lovely huton space learning to make dumplings and noodles

everything was super clean and organized the ingredients were all fresh and savory

joyce was spot on with our special requests there was soothing music on and after we ate joyce a friendly and balanced soul chatted with us at length about her childhood memories etc

it was a very nice experience, what a fun night we had making our own delicious dumplings and noddles  delicious because joyce the hostess and owner prepares the ingredients and guides you every step of the way fun because well  how often do you get to make your own dumplings and noddles and eat what you make plus joyce was the perfect hostess and instructor beer and wine included in the rmb 300 per person, this was a very enjoyable way to spend the afternoon joyce was such a wonderful hostess she welcomed us to her cooking class with wine rice wine and nonalcoholic beverages should we have wanted them the dumplings were delicious as were the pulled noodles i would definitely recommend this class is such an enjoyable and educational way to appreciate beijing culture as seen through the eyes of a local, depues de haber probado dumplings casi todos los dias nada mejor que cerrar la experiencia de viaje por china tomando un clase aprendiendo a prepararlos muy recomendado ellos te proveen de todo tu solo tienes que poner atencion y corazon joyce es genial, the booking was easy and joyces response was very prompt with clear directions

although the place was small but very warm clean and welcoming we were a group of eight so we have the place by ourselves joyce treated us with a cup of nice tea and snacks to start with then we learned how to make dumpling from scratchand also a easy way to do noodles joyce also offered us wine to go with the meal three hours passed very quickly with lots of laughter

we have been to beijing many times but this experience was the very first we definitely will go back on our next visit and we highly recommend this excellent fun place to our friends, we had a group of 6 travelers gather around joyce pans table to learn to make three kinds of dumplings and noodles it was great fun joyce is an excellent teacher and then we ate what we made, this was one of my favorite activities in beijing we booked a class on a sunday night and we were the only ones to sign up so we had the room and lesson to ourselves joyce met us at a coffee shop that was easy to find we then walked through the neighborhood ally ways to reach the kitchendining room we started off by making dough then we learned to stuff and fold dumplings last we made noodles joyce was a great teacher and we had a lot of fun getting to know her the food was delicious and we left stuffed and happy im glad joyce is going to be able to renovate her space she has a great class and i recommend checking it out the only thing i would change is that i did not receive a copy of the recipes we made it would have been great to know the portions to use when i came home, joyce met us outside by the coffee shop so we could find our way she walked us through the rustic back alleys of the local neighborhood what an experience and sight to see we felt very safe her kitchen was quaint and charming joyce and her assistant were great she taught us to make from scratch delicious traditional chinese dumplings and noodles

it was just my husband and me so we got to know and ask tons of questions about her her family and china my only wish is that we experienced this soon in our trip as she had some great advice

i made some for my family at home and it turned out amazing

thank you for everything joyce, the dumplings we had here were the best ones we had in beijing beyond that it was cool to have basically a private lunch in a cozy home the host spoke excellent english and was super friendly giving us tips for visiting the lama temple after lunch i highly recommend this place, they are experts at their craft fresh dumplings made to order before your eyes the tradition and quality of this establishment is above and beyond what one would expect at first glance, <u+975e><u+5e38><u+5225><u+7dfb><u+7684><u+4e00><u+500b><u+9ad4><u+9a57><u+4e3b><u+4eba><u+975e><u+5e38><u+71b1><u+60c5><u+6574><u+500b><u+5c0f><u+9662><u+5b50><u+7279><u+5225><u+5177><u+6709><u+50b3><u+7d71><u+4e2d><u+570b><u+98a8><u+60c5><u+5403><u+7684><u+4e5f><u+4e0d><u+932f><u+9921><u+6599><u+975e><u+5e38><u+8db3><u+5f88><u+597d><u+5403><u+5927><u+5bb6><u+90fd><u+5f88><u+6eff><u+610f><u+63a8><u+85a6>, we had a last with joyce at garden temple so fun to make and sooooo yummy to eat i would totally recommend you go and try this little place and its little but clean and so enjoyable its an experience we couldnt replace do it, i saved this place on my list to do in china and kind of forgot about it i am so glad i got lost and stumbled upon it right away i signed up for the class oh boy was i not mistaken the class is not big but very cozy and clean soft music playing in the background joyce is so joyful and sweet everything is made fresh prepped in front of you we learned how to mix the dough for the dumplings and noodles the fillings choices depend on what the group like and if anybody has allergies very accommodating which takes the whole experience into the next level drinks are offered wine beer or soda
we got to sample the most traditional moon cake and different snacks unforgettable night the food was amazing the flavors heaven oh how i wish to have one of these dumplings right now hands down the best dumplings ive ever had it is her familys recipe
it didnt stop at that joyce invited us to go to a tea event the family that was there decided to go back to the hotel they have a young child she ended up taking me on her scooter the attending a class turned into the best night i spent in china i didnt only learn the art of making dumplings but the art of brewing tea with the locals all of that thanks to joyce
from joyce to joyce thank you
and to whoever is reading this review do not miss this unique and unforgettable experience in china, atelier super interessant nous avons appris a faire des dumplings et des pulled noodles joyce est sympathique et parle tres bien anglais, dumplings en famille dans une ambiance tres decontractee en plein centre des hutongs
tres bonne experience  joyce est aux petits soins et on ne voit pas le temps passe
les dumplings sont excellents  a faire si vous avez le temps , was a must vist for me and trip advisor was right fresh made to order

loved the soup dumplings noodle dish too

had special seafood soup dumpling and then ordered more pork andshrimp was awesome

no old dumpling here this was so fresh you can watch them make it

great for the true foodie

this in not a tourist spot in a local mall off food court but if you want the best this is it

very special treat and great value, we were amazed at how tidy joyces kitchen was it was truly a pleasure to take a class here it is set in a traditional chinese hutong although as joyce explained all the tenants built rooms into the courtyard and now its just a hallway so its now a courtyardless hutong

her style of teaching is very soft and gentle she preps most of the ingredients for you so it doesnt require a whole lot of prep and knife skills like other classes joyce demonstrates the mixing of the dough kneading rolling and filling of the dumplings then you knead the dough and roll out the dumpling skins yours will not look like joyces this is something that requires a lot of practice to gain any kind of expertise then joyces kitchen assistant will steam the dumplings and then you will eat them delicious

next we stretch the dough prepared by joyce to make noodles hers will be straight and thin yours will be thick and lumpier then her assistant will boil the noodles and you will eat the noodles with an amazing eggplant sauce prepared by the assistant and this also is really yummy

throughout the evening she served us snacks and beverages it started raining while we were taking the class and she even supplied ponchos for us to take with us joyce is truly delightful and i cant say enough good things about what a pleasure she was to work with

joyce accommodated our dietary needs vegetarian and those of another class participant peanut allergy she books via email and will get your dietary requirements beforehand and will accommodate very easily she is very communicative and very flexible a true pleasure to deal with

we also took a class from beijing cooking school a couple of days earlier and it was a completely different experience equally wonderful but completely different joyces kitchen is amazingly tidy and pretty chef chaos is functional manly not pretty joyces class has a lot more handholding chef chaos class is a lot more handson we thoroughly enjoyed both styles of classes i highly recommend both, apprendre a faire des dumplings et ensuite les deguster cest genial  joyce est une hote super tout est tres propre et les dumplings sont vraiment bon  joyce nous montre de maniere simple a preparer les dumplings le tout dans une ambiance decontractee pour une experience unique cest la place
ca se combine tres bien avec une visite du temple des lamas ou de confucius puisque cest a deux pas de la, what to say about joyce and her team that hasnt already been said from the moment we got in touch by email to the final mouthfull of beautiful tasting dumplings this experience was delightful in addition to the dumplings we had great company of 4 and it was a great experience learning how to cook dumplings and noodles we had a nice surprise with a secret ingredient dumpling too ha thanks joyce generous offerings and decent selection of beverages to accompany meal we most definitely highly recommend this cooking class to all and sundry, it was a cool experience the place is very clean the process of subscribing for the dumpling class really easy uncomplicated and flexible joyce also offers vegetarian options and most importantly the dumplings are great joyce also does very well with taking care of her guests by offering beer wine and complimentary snacks while making the dumplings moreover she is very friendly helpful and speaks english really well

as a result it feels like being at someones home which is a great experience the only problem is that another lady prepares a lot of things upfront cutting vegetables etc and also boils or fries the dumplings so you dont get to do the whole process but this is more of a minor thing and some people probably even prefer it that way, this was a very nice experience  joyce is great we had such a great and fun time beautiful and simple place with a big heart 
mr peace, great experience in the crazy beijing couple of hours in an small and clean house in a hutong  learning to cook noodles and dumplins and then eating them in a good atmodphere you will enjoy, attended the cooking class in may 2016 so much fun and thoroughly enjoyed learning to make dumplings and noodles definitely worth doing and joyce was a great host thanks, i booked an evening for my parents and my 2 sons ages 9  6 we all thoroughly enjoying learning how to make dumplings and noodles and also learning about hutong life totally worth the price for such a great experience, would recommend visiting the temple and exploring the area first joyce was amazing and accommodated two vegetarians and three meateaters felt very much like visiting someones home instead of a tourist operation which was just what we were looking for, our family two adults and two teenagers enjoyed a fun lunchtime cooking class with joyce we learned how to make pork and vegetarian dumplings and noodles which were then cooked for us for lunch joyce was a great teacher and hostess her kitchenrestaurant in the hutong was charming and spotlessly clean the booking process was efficient and her meeting instructions clear the cookery class was one of the highlights of our stay in beijing you wont be disappointed, joyce was a wonderful teacher she was accommodating to my dietary restrictions im vegetarian we prepared chinese dumplings two types of pork and two types of vegetarian and chinese noodles the dishes were delicious the class is held in a hutong an alleyway neighborhood that has a lot of charm i thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would recommend the class, sono trovato questa attivita grazie a tripadvisor e mi sono divertita tantissimo ho preso parte ad una lezione di cucina molto semplice adatta anche alle famiglie con bambini ho imparato anche come fare i ravioli cinesi al vapore e alla piastra e i noodles saltati e richiesta una prenotazione diretta dal loro sito compilata in inglese per prendere parte alla lezione
caldamente consigliato

ive found this activity thanks to tripadvisor and it was really funny ive participate to a cooking lesson that was truly easy accessible also to families with children i learned how to do dumplings steamed and grilled and stirfried noodles it is necessary to book the course in advance by their website
heartily recommended, this cooking class is out of the ordinary 
great overall amazing experience 

whats so special 
you get to see and experience where the old locals live humble cottage small houses tiny kitchen shared toilet small alleys etc enjoyed soaking in the simple old beijing lifestyle in hutong

joyce
she gave very clear instruction on where to meet and came on time she is so warm and friendly and passionate in her cooking class she took care of every small detail from offering of fruit infused watersmall basket of cherries and biscuits on table helping to buy us cold drinks etc

cooking class
its fun and so meaningfull learning to make dumpling and noodles from scratch and ending up having them as your dinner how awesome  the noodles and dumplings taste so good too

departure
joyce offered to book uber driver for us and led us to the car and ensured our safety before leaving

dont leave bejing without booking joyce pans dumpling and noodle making class , dumplings are the speciality and they are great the vegetables are very fresh and deliciouseach one is perfect with nice warm broth in the middle, joyce is an excellent teacher and tour guide every stage in the dumpling making was clearly explained and demonstrated it was a really enjoyable morning spent in a lovely hutong building ending with a delicious lunch highly recommended, i surprised my boyfriend with a dumpling and noodle class on our arrival in beijing
we had a blast joyce was the perfect teacher and the food was fresh authentic and delicious our weekend in beijing could not have had a better start

thank you joyce, great evening with lovely joyce making our own dumpling skins and pulling own noodles we made both pork and vegetarian dumplings we had lovely hutong experience making food and enjoying dinner with joyce something a little different to do with the family and good excuse to sit down after touring around town all day, my husband and i participated in this cooking class back in october while in beijing and we had such a fun time the class was fully booked the night we went its not a big space so you may want to book ahead if you have limited time in beijing joyce meets the group at an easy to find coffee shop and walks everyone to the house she gives a little history on the area while walking there which is nice once there she demonstrates how to make different dumplings and after you prepare the dumpling stuffing as a group you get to make your own dumplings ours definitely werent as pretty as hers but they still tasted really good she supplements the groups dumplings with some of her own plus a side dish and drinks its an informative class thats very laid back and a lot of fun the dumplings were really tasty, we learned to make dumplings very nice and they tasted very well
the sweet dumplings made by joyce were surprising good, wonderful wooking lesson given by joyce we were 4 adults  1 five years little girl and everybody enjoyed if you have some spare time this is a must, the communication with joyce from my initial enquiry was outstanding she even got me some names of tailors in the area when i asked if she knew any her instructions on getting to the meeting place were fantastic and she collected us right on time it was lovely to have a walk through the hutong before getting to joyces quaint little restaurant the class started with some nibbles which were great and then we got stuck into it we made one meat and two vegetarian dumplings and also some noodles joyces instructions were clear and easy to follow she also has a lovely and warm nature which makes you very comfortable i would highly recommend doing joyces cooking class while in beijing the dumplings tasted amazing and we even got some surprise chocolate ones for dessert, a great way to learn how to make dumplingsnoodles from scratch and you get to eat the fruits of your labour at the end too as well as more dumplings that the professionals have made the nutella dumplings for dessert were a nice surprise to finish the experience joyce was a really good teacher both friendly and helpful she was very accommodating with our last minute booking and even though we had limited time in beijing were glad that we did this, we enjoyed this experience so much we went down a small hutong street into a local home to learn how to make authentic dumplings

joyce was so great  shes friendly prompt quick to respond we booked the day of and got lucky with availability we had so much fun making dumplings and noodles i really recommend doing this if you are in beijing

word of advice if you cant make it after booking please let her know the night we went three people noshowed on her this isnt a restaurant with tons of seating shes a super nice and knowledgeable local who spends the money and time preparing for these dinners standing her up costs her time and money  and its just plain rude and irresponsible too

joyce speaks perfect english and was so helpful in translating some things for us too in summary delicious food incredible and authentic experience and a great host highly recommended, my tour group came here to eat after endlessly looking through all the many places to eat in this lovely city we were not disappointed although we spoke little chinese the staff were patient and looked after us well the food was of a very high standard the dumplings were to die for, ��� ����� ����������� ��� ���� ������� ������������ ����� ������� ������������ ��������� ���  ����� �������� ������ ���� ����� ����� ������ ���� �������, i surprised my family by making a reservation for this experience on christmas day and we all had a blast

the ownerhost joyce picks you up at a costa coffee near lama temple and leads you into the hutong the location really adds to the experience as you go deep into a hutong with a local

joyce then teaches you how to make dumplings  she has the fillings prepared by her staff but you make the dough and form the dumplings my familys were great mine  ehhh  kind of sadshaped the dumplings are then boiled and fried two different ways and the feast begins so tasty we then learned to make handmade pulled noodles and of course ate those too

joyce is a fantastic host and her english is excellent

i dont know why this is listed in the restaurant category maybe joyce does run a restaurant there at night or on off days but we were there for the cooking class which was offered twice a day

i give this experience a top 5 star rating  thank you joyce, we were very interested in attending a cooking class while in beijing we initially considered black sesame but our tour guide vivie recommended her sisters dumpling and noodle making class in the hutong and we were so glad we did joyce was technically not conducting classes during the week we were in beijing as it was still the second week of the lunar new year holiday there but she very graciously accommodated us even though she was planning to fly to shanghai early the next morning the class was such a great experience her cooking studio is in a hutong  so the setting is quite unique we learned how to make the dough for the dumpling wrappers and pulled noodles we made 2 different types of dumplings pork and chive a noodle dish with a fresh tomato sauce  and joyce served us some snacks and side dishes as well as wine it was such a wonderful experience highly recommend it if you are adventurous and looking for something different to do in beijing, our family of 5 from the boston area truly enjoyed this unique experience  learning how to make chinese dumplings and noodles when in beijing we booked a 5pm dinner session and were joined by one other couple joyce was our very pleasant welcoming and enthusiastic chef who spoke excellent english and shared her knowledge about beijing customs lifestyle and cuisine she met us at a local coffee shop and walked us through the hutong area to a home used for this cooking and dining experience after we finished preparing our fillings wrapping dumplings and pulling noodles we were treated to wine and soft drinks as we enjoyed sampling all of the food we prepared what a valuable experience for us to share as a family one of the best things we did in beijing, joyce met me in the local costa coffee shop which was very easy to find per her instructions she is very welcoming speaks excellent english and is knowledgable about the dumplings and noodles that she expertly shows you how to make in her hutong i will definitely be trying to make them again at home they were delicious we spent a good while talking about various things including the lovely rice wine which she markets and lets you taste after dinner which was also very enjoyable  all in all a great evening which i would recommend to everyone","vegetarian restaurant",0.882759712547256

��, since we ate here from 2006 wow we really love here good italian food good service reasonable price if you want fine dining home cooked quality italian food this is not the place for you even we not live in beijing anymore we still go there if we are in china no matter which city we are we will fly
��, present in many locations near workers stadium chaoyang park in front of united family hospital you can eat good italian food at a reasonable price they have a very fast deliver service ordering by phone with no extra cost, annes italian restaurant has been around for over 20 years and now have many branches it is a casual restaurant with a good selection of pizzas pastas and other main italian dishes the staff speaks good english and service is good prices are very affordable, good italian food good service reasonable price if you want fine dining home cooked quality italian food this is not the place for you if you want a quick easy meal that tastes good is served with a smile and is reasonably priced then choose annies there are no frills it does as it says on the tin, the food here is consistently very good comparable with for example pizza express in the uk service is friendly and helpful and the delivery service is efficient too they can usually take your order in english but it would help you to have the menu with you when you call them because each item has a code number, for the americans reading this think one step up from the olive garden without the endless bread sticks and salad never had a bad meal from here they are always consistent i think thats the take away the chain is very consistent english menus a staff that is mostly trained in western customer service and they have a very efficient

��, american version of what they think italian food should looktaste like here you get spaghetti and streak in the same dish along with ketchup and prepared by chinese this is among the worst italians ive ever been even the coffee is made with cheap beans and served lukewarm this is italian food for those who dont understand it, after 10 days in asia it was a true surprise to get a really well cooked and original italian meal fresh mozzarella stone oven baked pizza and i also tasted the risotto al asparagi which came with real parma cheese all in all the best meal i had on this trip i give 5 stars because its authentic italian outside

��, best sushi in beijing we ordered rock shrimp and it was spicy but delicious we also ordered 3 different type of rolls that were amazing, we ordered a whole bottle of sake which is more expensive than the rest of food we had definitely worth of it we wanted it cold so the waiter put the bottle into a jar to keep it cool it tasted amazing food and service  hmm its so so, if youre gonna go to hatsune you should always go to this branch although their selection is very creamy mayoy and cheesy it is the best sushi youll find in beijing hands down the selection is not too too pricey considering the quality we would usually spend around 5600 rmb but we would be rolling out of there from stuffing
��, this place was always a popular stop with my coworkers when in beijing some of the best sushi i have had outside of japan, hatsune is in a convenient spotyou can stop here after a walk through sanlitun or before an evening out through the bar scene for those who seek authentic sushi and sahimi this is not going to satisfy you but if youre a fan of japanese flavors and like fusion style food this isnt bad among a group of 10 we
��, we were 5 persons having dinner we had a mix of sushi and other dishes the sushi was great and the steak teppanyiaki too the burritos were good not awesome nice place, if youd like to dine on overpriced average japanese food in a somewhat trendy then this is the place for you beijing has a thriving japanese food scene look beyond hatsune and you will not be disappointed, popped in for a quick lunch  cant rate this place highly enough i used to live in beijing and hatsune was a favourite so while back in town on a business trip wanted to see if it was good as i remembered while the layout had changed and the door with the secret opening was gone the food was
��, i love the ambiance of their sanlitun branch and definitely their food their grilled salmon head is awesome as well as their sushi tried their steak with foie gras but it was just average i find the meat drytempura was great though whenever i visit beijing i see to it that ill have a meal in this restaurant, my friend and i were wondering around the various diffident building for ages before we finally were escorted downstairs into the basement to the wrong restaurant the staff here then kindly took us upstairs to the 2nd floor to the hatsune the service was excellent most the waiting staff spoke good english and the food was beautifully presented and tasted
��, its casual a bit chic and best of all its apparent that this place cares about their product ive been a fan of this place for awhile but just recently found out that they have a secret dish every month the staff are friendly and attentive for the most part and the atmosphere is sometimes loud but that can be
��, love this restaurant environment is nice food is great and fresh and the price is reasonable definitely recommend it, when you think china the last thing that comes to your mind is sushi but i had seen so many
��, so maybe i was underestimating the olace in my last sentence  its actually one of the best japanese places ive ever been to go reserve a table and order youll love it enjoy, top japanese restaurant in beijing the food was really well prepared and fresh the staff was very attentious, at their guang hua lu location we had to wait for some simple rolls for nearly one hour when we asked the waitress for help she couldnt care less just said okay and turned to the neighboring table to rearrange some plates we will never go there again, a chinese business associate brought be to hatsune during a recent beijing business trip the food was very good and the service was as well, after a long workday this is the most relaxing and best way to finish a day with perfect sushi the seafood is super fresh  the appearance of all sushi creations is stylish and superb the taste is unique and absolutely great  each sushi is a taste of its own  wonderful  great drinks menu as well and
��, fresh sushi and sashimi grilled fish and meat are also fine famous for its innovative japanese rolls but not my personal favourite i consider hatsune generous to serve a small appertiser and a small dessert over dinner as it is inside the kerry complex with offices and hotels in cbd it can be full at around 630  730 pm
��, simply a wow  an amazing japanese treat in the heart of china from the special japanese wine to a
��, this is a pretty good trendy japanese restaurant with a modern touch lots of innovative sushi on the menu not much else need to make a booking  popular spot, i went a couple of time to hatsune sanlitun the restaurant settings and the atmosphere are enjoyable we could notice
��, hatsune is a great restaurant very well run good atmosphere for groups and the sushi is always fresh that said
��, very nice californian style rolls very fresh seafood and fish the only restaurant im not afraid to eat raw fish unfortunately they dont serve uni anymore big disappointment of these visit anyway its citys must try if you fan of fresh fish and delicious and perfect rolls rich wine list, i went to hatsune sanlitun branch the decoration and atmosphere is fine this wouldnt be a great choice for those who like the traditional style its more californian style and fushion dishes the roll has a lot of choices ranging from 60rmb  99rmb except the special one at 9999rmb there are also sashimi and rice bowl the food itself
��, found it on tripadvisor and tried it and were very happy that we have eaten there the food is delicious
��, first time to hatsune amazing food and quite a broad menu including several different variety of specialty rolls the tempura was light and fresh teriyaki chicken was well prepared and cooked to perfection sushi was fresh and well prepared the california rolls were the best ive ever had im in beijing for 5 more days and probably return to hatsune
��, hatsune was close last time we wanted to pay a visit it seems that after their refurbish of their restaurant they also reshuffled their chef i always eat ultra philly tool but unfortunately this experience was no longer as pleasant as it used to be, i am a regular customer at hatsune kerry center the quality of sushi is good and at affordable price sushi rolls are very much american style so even you do not eat raw fish you still also find sth such as foie gras beijing duck or tempura roll the lunch sets during lunch on weekdays are great value for 78

��, great sushi in beijing we had some sushi rolls and seared tuna salad which was really delicious service was fast and staff were friendly highly recommended, inspiring adventure well served portions delicious and delicious  every time i am in beijing i am visiting this restaurant  do not miss it, hatsune is definitely one of the best sushi places in beijing in addition the interior is great atmosphere awesome and service friendly guanghua lu location is bit better quality wise than sanlitun restaurant but sanlitun is really good as well and easy to go, definitely have to order the rolls  it was like a foodgasm and explosion of flavors in my mouth everything else was soso service was slow as there was a minister around on that day but the setting was absolutely beautiful the rolls however were to die for, ive travelled around beijing trying all these japanese restaurants hatsune is definitely the best one out there the rolls are excellent service is good too and thats rare in beijing its a bit pricey though but the quality definitely makes up for it and always reserve ahead of time they are always packed during dinner service walk in always have

��, i love the decor and the little origamis but i found the food bland and overpriced heard great reviews about it but was disappointed in the end, my wife and i always visited hatsune in the village sanlitun when we travelled to beijing the sushi is excellent and one of the best i have had outside japan the ingredients is always fresh and the sushi is presented in an excellent way we have enjoyed this restaurant many times and this was where our kids learned to eat
��, let me start by saying i am a foodie i come from australia where the produce is as good as anywhere in the world and we have a huge variety of international cuisines against that background i found this restaurant to be very poor the first thing that really grated on me is their copying of the nobu habit of
��, i have been in beijing 12 years and every time i go to hatsune i get consistently good california japanese cuisine those guys know how to keep customers coming back i had the same feeling when i tried their shanghai haiku branch thumbs guys you are doing a great job and as a hotelier and chef for 30 years my
��, i simply love hatsune beijing the quality of food is always of a high standard the service is good and the atmosphere is posh i like to go there for lunch great offers on lunch arrangements at an affordable price, probably the best japanese restaurant in beijing the service was very fast and the staff were very kind and the food is very good too, we was a the hatsune restaurant 2 days ago the restaurant is a liitle bit oustide but not far away
��, fresh sashimi and very good sushi rolls you can ever find in beijing english speaking staff and very chic ambience for friendsfamily gatherings overall we were not disappointed well received restaurant in san li tun, was recommended this restaurant by a colleague who has a very good taste and we were not disappointed we ordered the menu and could choose 3 rolls ourselves  which was hard as their selection is huge and it all sounded very good then we had some sashimies as well and some extra rolls and there were plenty of food

��, a really nice mediterranean restaurant the food is tasty and the service is excellent prices are fair the owners are very nice englishspeaking people extremely recommended, i like this place the furniture is simple even if is herein sanlitun but far away from the movidalocated in the historical joubajie the appetizer are amazing and the portion are bigthe price are good if you consider you are in expat zone, if you are looking for an alternative restaurant to the local ones and eager for top notch middle eastern food this is the place for you in beijing its definitely not the typical middle eastern restaurant youre expecting with the usual shawarmagyros stand etc but much more a western or cosmopolitan ambient place that serves some of the best dishes

��, we savoured a grand dinner at this busy eatery arriving without reservations we got an immediate table we began with arancini and ravioli next we opted for a fish dish and a steak accompanied by chinese beer these were all very tasty we were tempted by the desserts and availed from the choice the staff were great friendly and helpful
��, although the food is good the waiters attitude is unacceptable they give you more than you ordered and when you ask them to take back what you didnt order they start becoming aggressive and literally shouting at you trying to force you to pay for the non ordered food i never had such a bad experience in any other restaurant
��, recently beijings price inflation has hit most of our local businesses and la pizza is not an exception rations became smaller but offering the same taste thanks for that always service is ok wine selection is ok but little overpriced you can find this restaurant next to 33 plaza between sanlitun village sections 1 and 2 just follow that small
��, i reviewed la pizza at sanlitun before and said the quality was deterioratingit was not as bad as last time the food area is closed with high glass windows ac keeps you comfortable on hot beijing days you can clearly see that this place has a european touch service is ok we had croquettes fried mashed potatoes a mixed green
��, i came here with my daughter for a spot of lunch the greeting was nice they used italian and it seems our chinese waiter spoke more than just a tiny bit we sat by the window and looked at the extensive menu she chose the spaghetti pomodoro whilst i opted for the chicken salad the draught beer came quickly stella
��, honestly i dont know how other restaurants manage to sell what they call pizza all terribly trying to copy the successes of pizza hut or papa john those cakes with tomatoes and cheese shouldnt even be called pizza but rather tomato cake here you can taste what resembles most what a pizza should be unfortunately the restaurant isnt as good
��, pizza here was good probably the nicest one i have had in china although admittedly that is not many and most were terrible the restaurant itself is similar to most others in the area being clean and fairly well staffed the service was good i would describe it as good for china and perfectly acceptable by western standards as well, definitely recommend if you want to have a real naples pizza the menu has also different dishes from italian cuisine that are still great, more than just pizza although the pizzas are great the salads make a good main too service is good very popular place, the pizza was really good thin crust and great toppings the menu was available in english and the waiter also spoke some english would definitely recommend it, i eat at la pizza 34 times a week very authentic italian restaurant pizza pasta gnochi everything is made italian way, the ingredients are authentic as much as they can be and the pizzas they make out of them are great they also serve good italian beer at 100 rmb per 1 l bottle the staff is friendly and they keep bringing us free dishes such as salads focaccia etc maybe it is due to our italina friend who always takes
��, i think its our last dinner in beijing for this tripmy parents and i were so hungry and luckily the pizza was very deliciousi think its italian maybeits one of my favorite pizzafar more better tahn the pizzanut, i been there several times for sure the best pizza you can get in town dont try your luck with other pizza restaurant this is the place to be if you want a real pizza, after pursuing many eateries in beijing i thought that i had found my little secret you know  the place that you eat at at least twice on ever trip then i met with some others who actually live here the talk got around to favourite eating places and i was pleasantly surprised to learn that the whole group sang
��, i heard about this place many rave reviews and decided to taste a pizza there i ordered capricciosa but i got exactly not that i expected many small pieces of fresh ham plus olives not sliced and halfsliced champignons on the surface of dough it looks like that a cock took baked dough and placed on it all this ingredients
��, a cold evening in beijing alone and then this real italian pizza with a wonderful glass of red wine and a chat with the owner beijing is not cold any more and the city map has an important new mark la pizza in sanlitun warmly recommend this place <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>, the best pizza in town in beijing you can find here at la pizza in sanlitun 33 building not only pizza menu but also a very selection of italian meals from pasta to the meat and the fish the owners are the best one bravo giuseppe, we apre italians and normally we dont eat italian food while abroad we always prefer local food but this time thanks to giuseppe we have chosen this place giuseppe is a very kind person and the food is perfectly original we have chosen this restaurant only because we saw actually and italian cook we ate pizza and tiramisu a corner
��, this is a super casual place which offers amazing pizzas im always ordering when im in town they have a wide selection of red and white pizzas i think the owner is originally from napoli the world centre for pizza making, we ordered a simple margherita pizza mushroom soup and tiramisu the pizza was very well made thin crust and we enjoyed it the highlight was the tiramisu ohh it just melted in our mouths would come again for the pizza and definitely for the tiramisu, my date and i both came hungry and ordered alot the diablo pizza the prosciuttosalami plate with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese and a pasta we finished all of it and the pizza was a highlight of the meal the crust was cooked to perfection and i really appreciated that this place has not fallen into the americanized pizza place trap
��, one of the thousand restaurants in sanlitun area the area of movida and nightlife you can find good prosciutto parmigiano and mozzarella the pasta was with too much tomato and the pizza not really good it was topped with a lot of tomato as well and not well cooked the ambience is nice, nice italian buffet  lot of imported food and quite from the noice of the road is it is at the 4rth floor, as italian i can say just few words this is the best pizza ive ever tried in beijing excellent ingredients and really good coffee, i havent found yet in china either a pizza or a tomato spaghetti better than the ones i had so many times in this restaurant it deserves the highest scores also because of the consistent quality it has been able to deliver over the last few years not expensive if considering the quality of the food and the efforts they
��, a good pizzeria in beijing italian style but also more important italian taste you can also try the pasta and some other dishes everything is tasty and fine maybe a little expensive for the average bejinger but it is worth at last a visit only people usually going to pizza hut or papa john should not go there they would
��, typical italian restaurant pizzeria here you can eat the best pizza in beijing better ingredients good location good and clean place gentle waiters however this its a little bit expensive but its pretty fine, best pizza in beijing   great staff amazing atmosphere a piece of italy in china if you are in beijing must go to eat there, i went there with my friendthe pizza i tell is not up to the mark first time i try herestill i prefer pizza hut according to the quality it is expensive, pizza and china not exactly a match made in heaven so pizza enthusiasts put your expectations of a real pizza away until you go to italy until then if youre in beijing and are craving some italian food try la pizza this place has a good variety of dishes including pasta salads calzones and of course pizzas prices are reasonable
��, paid 115 rmb for pizza margherita small piece small tiger beer and a single espresso possible negatives 1 the oven
��, good pizza slow service price was ok recommended cuz it is not a fancy restaurant and the food is fine, realy good past and pizza an italian venue in beijing please u got to try it i promisse you wont regret it, an italian friend recommended this place and i must say i was not let down they have a lot of pizzas ranging from 80 to 120 rmb and really good starters nevertheless and despite the certificate they hold on the wall it is not really authentic napoli pizza, as good as pizza gets outside of italy pizza is fantastic salads are great service is speedy and polite, i first visited la pizza at sunlitun in may 2013 upon a friends recommendation it had an italian manager then after visiting i thought it had one of the best pizzas in the far east the manager was very friendly and made special pizza and wine recommendations since we came of the near mediterranean area i was very pleased with
��, this pizza restaurant is located in a sanlitun side street just south of the opposite house hotel the restaurant isnt very fancy and the service was incredibly slow they do serve good pizzas however and they have an excellent selection of beers recommended for pizza and beer but due to the slow service order at least two beers each time
��, the best place i aet in beijing the best italian food i ever tasted the price is medium for chinesse live style around rmb200 for two persons my last time there i wait a lot for the food so they offer us a wine, small restaurant good selection of pizza and other dishes in summer during weekends it is hard to find a table but if you decide to queue you will be satisfied, the pizza has a crisp thin crust with many choices of toppings the manager was italian and very friendly this
��, this place was recommended on a number of sites so i decided to walk to sanlitun for a pizza got there early which was good as quese had started to form before i left food was good beer was cold and there was agreat selection real pizza which is a treat anywhere let alone beijing down side  management who
��, it is one of the best pizza that you can find in asia thanks to the ingredients specifically imported by the owner who is really a pizza and food perfectionist you can find different specialties and a good choice of wine and draft beer just one note book in advance because it is always crowded, always crowded by foreigners very good pizza salad and pasta they will do delivery tooreasonably pracied, having not been into sanlitun for a while we walked into la pizza one evening as we hadnt seen it before it boasts many awards in frames as you walk in and the food on customers tables looked pretty good however we were angrily told by the manager busy you wait so we waited and waited for about 10 minutes

7,"atmosphere is quite and relaxing food amazing the decoration is a bit too serious and old style but really clean, i recommend this restaurant and always come here when im in beijing ive been to a lot of these restaurants and this is on of the better ones, this has been my favorite dim sum restaurant in asia compared to the din tai fungs in other countries hong kongsingapore the one in beijing is on the cheaper side so i would recommend going if in the city around $15 usd and you will be really full there are plenty of locations and the food did not disappoint i recommend the xiao long bao and eggplant absolutely delicious i wish i had came with a larger group so that we could have ordered even more from the menu regardless great service and great food, the place is clean run efficiently and serves good dim sum at a reasonable price the menu is somewhat difficult in its lay out but helpful service is swift the various dim sum were cooked perfectly but is not very much better than other good dim sum offerings and the restaurant is easily outcooked by other good domestic restaurants, this place was awesome the restaurant was impeccably clean with friendly staff and delicious food we tried 3 different types of dumplings our favorite being the specialty pork wonton soup and the asparagus with shrimp all of it was sooooo good and reasonably priced

also the staff was so very friendly from start to finish multiple servers helped us throughout our visit and everyone was polite and smiling when leaving the manager wished a good evening with a warm smile

if in beijing definitely take the time to stop here you wont be sorry, wonderful food and service every single time
special kudos to the gm of this branch for training the staff so well, i came here with some friends who highly recommended it its very casual but the food is really good i just ate whatever came in front of me but was fun to share food which was so yummy i think its fun to come as a group noodle was great too, slept in yuyang hotel and it was great having my meals in this place i just want to say may be i am addicted to eating chinese food but the food is great and eating dumblings is so wonderful chop sticks man its a wonder on its own, the restaurants owned by ding tai fung company have the same clean setting and atmosphere the food in all locations is the same not very elaborated but palatable the menu is focused on different type of dumplings which are light and tasty in fact it appeals to chinese and foreign customers, dingtaifeng is almost the most delicious dumping place  it is nut so good  take a little bite first  be care ful of the hot soup inside  and then swallow it  i think i can eat 3 basket of them  just a little expensive , it was a nice restaurant and food was tasty the price was reasonablee but it was a bit crowded should try one time , we decided to try this place as it was the only restaurant selling chinese food that wasnt packed or didnt have a crazy hours wait and it was our last meal before we left china so wanted it to be a good one but we were very disappointed firstly the menu looks amazing had what we were both craving dumplings is a must and i do admit are delish but we also wanted duck and a vegetable dish and were told that there was none left sold out it was only 7308pm we were so disappointed but we committed to this restaurant so tried what else they had to offer to be honest the food is average the only good dish was the dumplings but what made it worse was after we got all our dishes about 30mins later the table next to us got duck what the the waitress couldnt explain and got her manager and it was advised they were cooking it which didnt help at all so just so you know if they say its sold out they are lying, these dumplings are the best i have ever had so delicate yet packed with flavor so many options to chose from thank you for another great recommendation andrew zimmern, typical chinese cuisine with quite tasteful dishes
have to be extra patient with the waiters as nobody speaks english , we came here 2 times during our stay in beijing this restaurant is just located nearby our hotel the service was good and prompt the dumplings noodles and fried rice were excellent the price is kinda on the high side but it worth the money, really excellent soup dumplings cab driver had major problems finding the place had to ask 5 different people youll have a great meal here but its a chain not unique to beijing  so youll lose out on local authenticity, go at least once a visit for the most consistent dumplings in china love the soup dumplings which as light and tasty without being oily we usually stick with the more normal dishes but love it either way, i eaten repeatedly at din tai fung near yuyang fandien in beijing the dumplings are simply great they manage to consistently deliver high quality and taste i am especially a fan of their crab dumpling variations which are excellent the cleanliness of din tai fungs kitchen is unrivalled in china and you can watch the preparation of fresh dumplings through a window a nice touch

the crowd is a mix between chinese and foreigners due to the fame of the place expect to wait a bit for a table during rush hours so if you can call ahead for a reservation when seated waiters will also make sure any hand bags or coats are securely stored ina small pouch so they are not stained should some parts of your or your neighbours meal travel that far 

while the place is certainly famous for its dumplings and most people go there for them they also serve great tea and i especially love their sesame noodles not to forget the vegetables which are full of flavour and cooked excellently

what else deserves mentioning is that their menu offers a simple icon aided choice to ask staff to avoid msg in dished love this

one last thing they have airco and use it you might want to bring a sweater, i went on a tuesday at 200 and got right in their soupy dumplings are great but so was the shrimp and pork sui mai if you look at my pic you will see they make it different from anyone else, excellent dumplings very good service could be more convenient if the staff could speak better english overall wonderful experience, this is the place in beijing is you like dumplings every time we come here the food is spectacular the place is huge on two floors so you might not need to make a reservation, they dumplings be sick they got mad flavor and they melt inside of you mouth and they aint expensive much, we eaten at other dtf places before but we thought that this was the best so far the dumplings were fresh tasty and piping hot we liked the soupy contents that are contained in many of the dumplings and particularly liked the black sesame seed ones although they were a little slow on serving these ones, we arrived here and the restaurant looked like a fine dining resturant it had two levels we were placed on level 2 which was fairly empty the menu was extensive the waiters brought bag holders to rest our bags on and took orders dumpings were amazing however very small also had chocolate dumpling which is definitely worth a try staff were helpful enough to get us a taxi to the stadium which we could not say in chinese would go back again also wasnt too expensive and the toilet seats were heated, the menu book was extensive we arrived in beijing late and choose ding tai fung for lunch the next day our first meal in china did not disappoint we had the soup dumplings and a dish of steamed crab legs and fresh asparagus menu includes photos and english dish names very friendly staff, i read the reviews and have come to the conclusion they must write their own
service very poor
food almost cold
over priced rubbish
to cap it all they impose a 10 service charge
not the norm here in china obviously a chain
will never use again, we loved this restaurant our friend had recommended it and we just happened upon it looking for lunch while site seeing in beijing the dumplings with the soup in them are just so delicious the location was central and it was easy to communicate with the server which was a plus the kitchen is open so you can watch the people making the dumplings its was so clean too loved it, after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor we decided to try din tai fung whilst the service was good and the food tasty i can honestly say that i didnt notice a huge difference from this restaurant to any other that we dined in during our beijing stay

the decor is nice and its clear that the restaurant has won many awards decent restaurant but not quite sure why so many outstanding reviews, thought the food was very good and loved the chocolate dumplings for dessert but overall almost 10x more expensive than a local dumpling shop that we liked even more total cost around $60 for two people and the restaurant is just in a mall not the best atmosphere  though it is a cool high end mall i would try other places before going back here but dont want to take away too much because the food is very good just think there is a lot of competition, din tai fung yuyang has become a favorite during our stay in beijing it has great dimsums and a variety to choose from the seafood dumpling is superbthe vegetable dishes are excellent efficient service and good value for money the best thing is it is located close to where we are staying at oakwoods residence, the taxi driver could not find the restaurant so we were dropped at the yunyang hotel and were pointed in the direction of the restaurant as we progressed down a dark unmade up street we became increasingly nervous asking every 50 yards or so for directions from the map provided by the hotel we arrived at what the doorman assured us was the right place sat down and had the most delicious dinner great dim sum great vegtables and the best fried rice i have eaten for many years outstanding, good restaurant for fans of dim sums
good interior design atmosphere is clean and comfortable
good service
delicious dim sums and in large quantities, made to order fresh 5 star for fresh food and value the best in beijing by far

i sought out based on trip advisor reviews and it was spot on

soup dumplings made to order served fresh  could not believe it was not packed and its in a mall food court

no tourists but truly amazing  must go if your a foodie near lama temple

seafood special soup dumpling served piping hot was the best

no sauces needed on these shrimp and pork was awesome too  noodles great

value was amazing and food 5 stars best dumplings i ever had

watch them thru glass as they make your order

please open in usa im still craving these bundles of joy weeks later great job guys, great atmosphere friendly staff and the best dumplings in town
a mustgo when you are in beijing, id say this is a lovely place with delicious food the steamed buns are delicate with variety chooses of the stuffing my favorite is the crab roe buns quoting to my friend its like a piece of heaven in your mouth, weekly business lunch  have eaten my way through most of this menu and havent had an average dish yet
6 years in this city and its my go to for a good lunch
recommend  dumplings are good however try the noodles and read through the menu and be adventurous its all good
allow time as it is busy at lunch time, these were the best dumplings i ever had in my life
went there more than once as it was so amazing
very good food and service
definitely recommend it
my favourite one was the one with truffles inside but all the others was equally good, lots of dumplings to choose from and great ambience try the crab dumplings and also the strawberries shaved ice a place of preference for lots of foreigners, make sure you dont miss din tai fung the food is superbly cooked not a luxurious environment but you will really struggle to eat something you will not fall in love with, we have eaten here a dozen or more times reason its that good their dumplings
are fantastic their soup dumplings are something we dream about hot beef stock together with a beef ball inside of a dumping just the right size but you have to watch out because the soup is hot the rest of their menu is full of winners decor quite contemporary
family friendly, love and hate this place  as a chain restaurant they do a good job beijing shanghai los angeles or taipei its all good still a chain restaurant though good standards in quality and sanitation but still rather mass produced  enjoy my fav is the crab roe baozi double boiled chicken soup and ice mountain, as number 6 out of more than 10000 restaurants in beijing i expected it to be pretty good especially after having such a good experience with the restaurant that is rated number 7 in the list
i guess din tai fung has very good pr otherwise i cant explain how they got those reviews
the dumplings are good the chick that i took following the waiters recommendation was average not more not less
the steamed rice cake was bad
the total price of 151 yuan was way too much for what ive got and definitely for the quality of it
the waiters kept asking me if all is good but didnt bother to listen to the answer just asked in a robotic way

bottom line  you can find much cheaper dumplings and even better ones, i am staying in a hotel 2km away chose to go to din tai fung after reading reviews in tripadvisor
perfect
nice staff great food reasonable prices
had a sweet and sour soupe and dumplings with pork both dishes were great
a place to go, a favorite of my whole travel group excellent restaurant and service we visit every year and book a hotel within walking distance the jingan temple is on the way a short safe scenic walk and a great night all around, ive often felt disappointed on return visits  not so here
they specialise in dumpling  but we also tried soup vegetable and fried rice dishes all were very good
i also liked the glass wall view of the kitchen it was very clean , this was one of the nicest restaurants i visited in china their hot and sour soup was a perfect balance of spiciness and sourness which is hard to find we chose a selection of dumplings and really liked everything we tried i would definitely recommend this place, we had difficulty ordering in restaurants as majority of waiters cannot speak english we get by as travelers always do but din tai fung had staff that speak english so she was able to explain the types of dimsum that they have this made the experience more enjoyable as she gave us a background of the food we ordered, ate her a couple of times as good clean tasting food easy to work out what you are ordering  staff helpful even when they have no english  and i have no chinese if you eat in evening they always seem to have run out of duck and bbq pork, fantasy food and wonderful taste   be patient

the very long queues are the evidences how good this restaurant is

the food are very good whether you order anything

i could close my eyes and choose the menu randomly 

so why not try some , ive been to this din tai fung branch twice and it has been equally good both times the servers speak english and are very friendly and accommodating we ate here four people for around 350 rmb the location is quite nice close to sanlitun shopping district and the embassy neighborhood its a quiet area next to a river","self-serviсe buffet",0.582008481217375

��, this was our second time diner here 1st time was when it opened about 56 years ago this second experience was bad food quality was poor including its famous steak tuna tartar was not fresh too probably due to cost cut, overall the steak was very good but the crab cakes were average as compared to the one we had in morton singapore service was slow and inattentive perhaps due to our table being near the kitchen crumbs on the table were not cleared before our main meal this is so unlike the great quality services which we had enjoyed at

��, i had a set dinner and i requested for a replacement of the main to something else they gladly accommodated it i had all the peace and quiet moment to myself and the service attendants were detailed to my sequence of dishes and needs good service and ambience  i have been to this restaurant last year too in total
��, ive dined here during numerous trips and the food is always first rate the chef is from italy and he knows his way around the kitchen, we had dinner there by chance but it was certainly worth it did not have variety but the few plates it offers are well chosen from the chef the waiters do not speak english but stella zheng the assistant manager did a great job translating for us somehow expensive but it is situated in ritz carlton, for ritz calrtonhotel wasnt that grat place was quite empty on friday night no foreign manager one chinese waiter spoke so so english my tomato pasta tasted like ketchup the desserrt was very food chocolate ball something, barolo italian restaurant i get a service from nice staff who take care me all of thing they make me feel impress also food is delicious i would recommend ministroni soup is very yum if i have time i will come back again, good food good view the food cooked very fast and very fresh about service everyone very friendly and always ready to service maybe ill come back to barolo again see you soon, stayed here for only one night in dec 2012 its very luxurious and cool crystal chandeliers everywhere in the lobby in the basement on the lift and even in some toilets it grants me a sense of luxury that i long felt for, very disappoint come to barolo this december on my business trip as few friend recommended this restaurant to me and as a regular of ritz carlton hotels in general i decided to give it a try this has been my worse mistake this restaurant is not at all up to the standard of ritzcarlton hotels food is very very mediocre
��, the only reason im giving it three stars is the attentive restaurant manager who actually made a point in asking for feedback on the food  and that deserved to be recognized other than that the dining experience was mediocre at best the beef carpaccio was ok though it lacked seasoning and the risotto was a bit too al dente
��, i travel the beijing frequently and eat here quite a loton this occasion i celebrated my birthday here whilst on honeymoonthe food and atmosphere were fantastic kevin and his team looked after us so well and made sure that the evening was extremely enjoyablethe highlight was when he presented my new wife with a beautiful red rose at the end
��, well finally you get to the point that all you crave for is western food and you arrive to barolo with high expectations and basically just disappoints you in every way it is not terribly bad it is just lame, had really nice lunch with good price  lunch set menu 198rmb  service is warming and polite for casual lunch or dinner very suitable was having lunch with a friend and my baby 19months old have to say that service for my child was excellent and playful will recommend this place for people with familys too, the baloro restaurant is by far the best italian restaurant in the city my husband and i love this restaurant staff and food so much that we just had our wedding reception there everything was absolutely beautiful the environment and service were just amazing we felt really pampered congrats to chef ivan who truly impressed us with delicoius food if

��, extremely disappointing experience this place is mediocre at best and extremely over priced given the location inside the ritz and the title of best italian in beijing they need to seriously improve the service and food quality the service was extremely slow and inattentive the waitress repeatedly brought the wrong bottle of wine to the table and then kept reminding
��, unfortunately we have to give this restaurant lower ratings than it should receive and this is all due to the very uncomfortable experience created by the overattentive staff we left as soon as we had eaten our mains  would have stayed for dessert but the environment was too uncomfortable the staff hovered and stared all through the meal however

��, jet lagged and up at 400 am this was a haven friendly staff got us beers fries and spring rolls even though most of the kitchens of the hotel had closed down nice live bands  check schedules, we were there with a small group of friends for the 80�s boogie night � brilliant great band fantastic atmosphere was a lovely time � than you for the evening and we will be back for more, we came here few times because they have live music and we love the place but every time we come here we always had the same feelingthe service was too slow hope they will improve this and dont lets the customers feel thirsty with these empty glasses, of course it was 530 and happy hour was on by 1 get 1 free we had the nachos not back for a nation far far away from texmex the waitress had hard time with orders she even had problems when we would point to what we wanted, this is a high quality place with high by beijing standards prices but reasonable by western  expenses account standard all aspects are high quality and high quality understated service the bar has a happy hour which is buy one get one free  and they way they do it is that you dont get them served to you all
��, centro has been our family bar for almost 5 years and each year the quality of this bar keeps getting better ps its worth checking out the canadian band , my wife and i organised a going away party for some friends and had a ball billy arranged everything for us  the champagne was cold and the live band got everyone in the mood to party cocktails are good too from a knowledgeable bar team a great night thank you, it was a busy friday evening but service was still fast with the beer and finger food which we appreciated alot, centro is an amazing bar the music is very impressive and the service is five star the menu prices are fair and anytime that i have guests come to visit me in beijing i take them here i will certainly be back many times in the near future, this is a cool place to have a few drinks since the bartenders know how to make drinks  cocktails and you get some servicethe band they have often playing is not bad the problem is that the music  band is always extremely loud its hard to keep a conversation in this bar unless you outside, this is a legendary place in beijing perfect for some drinks after dinner on a friday evening with friends when the place is busy and rocking the bands change regularly and in the last few years all the bands were awesome apart from one singer from poland who was below the usual quality of the place the cocktails are great
��, with the new band there is so much fun if you come here just a bit before 800 pm there is a happy hour till 800 pm then you can hang around until the new band starts at 900 pm love it, they have good live band and sufficient selection of drinks particularly wine so you will always find something to drink the outside area unfortunately is filled with smokers which suffocate you so it has to be indoor for non smokers, as an after work drinking spot this is probably the best in beijing for foreigners seeking to get a taste of home the beer selection is quite nice and the cocktail menu reminiscent of new york and toronto every time i am in beijing i make it a point to have a drink and a lounge at centros you usually
��, ive been here a few times and always enjoy the live band on weekends nice atmosphere and easy to find a taxi when leaving, we were looking for a decent place for a drink after dinner and this bar has quite a good reputation it was a weekday and the bar was busy we ordered a bottle and had a great evening out the bandmusic is good easy listening the atmosphere is ok overall a wide mix of people, centro is an interesting bar part pickup place part expat place part cigar bar part music place happy hour is nice good people watching food is expensive but good nice beer and wine choices, for a lot of money you get a lot of bar deafening live music great drinks and okay service considering how busy they were cocktail and wine list were pretty impressive and the decor was fun good place to bring colleagues or business people for drinks but dont expect to get too much talking done with the live band, i came to this place after quite a long day with the great wall  other local activities the place itself is nice  somewhat relaxing the service sucks they take way too long to get your drink order or acknowledge that your drink is empty also hh is only for the same drink that you get you cant mix
��, recently spent a week in beijing on business and was lucky enough to stay in the kerry hotel centro bar is a place i will always remember the staff and service was excellent and the atmosphere was superb even on a week night drinks although pricey were top notch and the mix of customers really gave the place a good
��, i also am one of the regulars at centro my colleagues and i come here often as it is a short walk from work and it has become a place for us to let off some steam and have a chat after work the happy hour 1for1 is a great deal like a reviewer said the place may have come
��, i am one of the regulars reviled by marks review this is totally inaccurate and insulting funnily a bar is
��, frankly speaking it may not be the best in the field but every staff there is the most friendliest diligent loyal wholehearted employee i have ever seen and visitors should simply ignore the one and only incoherent speech commented recently service obviously would take much longer when a bar is packed out and needless to offend the unfortunate working girls
��, i guessed what attracted me to this place was that im staying in kerry hotel and the fact that they offer 11 drinks during happy hour this is really a bargain and i had 4 long island tea good place to chill out especially very good live band if youre no a smoker like me do choose a non smoking
��, this is a very good place to spend an evening when you are in beijing good drinks good atmosphere and good live music the food is subpar but this is not really a restaurant, very cosy bar with nice people starting from early with live music and last until lateeither  bar or table
��, words cannot express my feelings i went there four nights admirable cocktails with seamless live performances can take you away from all business you got for whole day best option for people who stays in kerry hotel, staff dressed according to the theme of the night be it medical or salsa special music gigs always nice life

��, the brunch here is great they poach a good egg and the atmosphere is very nice they dont hassle you and let you just sit and relax lots of seafood on the brunch menu if you like that, it used ti be a great restaurant now it is just average serving mainly south american food the atmosphere is ok but you have to wait for a long time to get the dishes you have ordered there are better restaurants in the area for the same price, great place to be for lunch or dinner located conveniently in sanlitun area the restaurant is located in a nice area with nice buildings great food and nice wines are available, a friend and i visited mosto for lunch the set menu of three courses is a good value and food was tasty a nice selection for each of the courses is offered we were fortunate to get a table on the outdoor deck with dappled sun and blue sky which always makes a day in beijing better, mosto produces consistently good food straightforward meals cooked well the most recent visit i had culminated with a special night for traditional peruvian ceviche tiradito and carpaccio  with different dishes bringing together fresh fish with chile onion and flavors such as mango  lemon and coconut we had a taste of all of the varieties on offer the seabass

��, the popups at mosto have been awesome the had a spanish wine one from le sommelier and a peruvian ceviche both were excellent went here with my wife on friday for the lunch special 95 rmb for 2 courses monday to friday food was excellent and was very happy with the setting and atmosphere, spanish food mainly a mix of tapas and main meals and a specials menu too service was slow and the usual thing of not replenishing drinks a china thing i think as it happens in most places but the atmosphere was relaxed and modern the menu varied and the prices good will def come back again, what can better this spot for casual to formal business lunch spot on pricing currently 95 rmb for two courses fine food prepared by quality chefs in an open kitchen nice surrounds that somehow manage both a relaxed but business suitable atmosphere mosto has won or been in the finals of best business lunch for several years and its easy
��, the place looks good it is clean the service is good the food is hand made like the pasta this is all true the food however is bland and you really dont get much food if youre a hipster you will love this place thou for sure, weve been here more than a few times and have always had a great meal the food staff and atmosphere fantastic i enjoy chinese food but every once in awhile enjoy a meal closer to home if you too are searching than this is the place for you, mosto is a busy shopping mall type restaurant service was slow the night we visited food good but not as good as the price tag suggests between us we had squid tuna and food gras starters and halibut and steak mains all as it should be good but nothing to say come back here rather than go elsewhere to the
��, i must admit iti cannot deal with chinese food when im travelling to china for business for months at a time and mosto its a little pearl with good food and good wine just around the corner of where i usually stay its convenient the staff is very attentive and they do speak english yeyeye nice rooftop view, this is was my common lunch place in beijing i loved the food and the great steak one of the best i could get in beijing the meat literally melts in the mouth combined with their great creme brulee the day is saved i really recommend that place for any occasion, if you go to mosto you need to go for lunch for 95 rmb mosto is one of the best lunch deals in the city pretty much everything on the lunch menu is great soups or salads the medallion steak the pork chop and for 15 rmb add a dessert too i have never had bad service here and most

��, every single course from the appetizer to the main dish to dessert is always amazing the atmosphere is very casual the prices are very reasonable 120 for three courses and the food is some of the best and most consistent in beijing, went for a birthday lunch arrived around 1330 stayed for about an hour the food was really great but unfortunately
��, one of my favorites in beijing especially over the summer when the terrace opened up  you can have dinner overlooking the other restaurants and seeing it all great to see them shaking up the menu every so often to keep the regulars coming and of course happy hour � just love it, food is great and service is at the top always busy place location is in the busy area of sanlitun bar streetsuggest to make reservation in advance, i took a chance and was rewarded with great food a little difficult to find but it was worth the effort the mains were fabulous but the desert was out of this world great care on the chefs part and the servers were knowledgable and answered all my questions deciding on dinner, frequent mosto patron in addition to the attractive quality wine selection the culinary experience is an enjoyable one every single time the bustling yet ambient atmosphere is great for dinner in the summer months the patio seating is a great spot to enjoy not only the weather but would also satisfy the avid people watchers, a great place for a morning brunch the restaurant is really nice and the atmosphere is awesome cocktails are really good and recommend eggs benedict were well made a really great dish we had some sort of meet past terrin which i do not recommend the good cheese salad was also really good, excellent atmosphere super food friendly and efficient staff good to know for brunch or lunch during the week, nice food worth that price great atmosphere and friendly stuff definitely one of my favorite restaurants in beijing, before leaving from my office visit in beijing went to this place for allyoucaneat brunch great quality great mimosas friendly staff all in all a whenwin, really good food we had prawn cocktail  mussels and risotto to die for  free flow wine for two

8,"this tiny place is terrific the food is wonderful and clever with a real sense of home cooking we swapped bites from plates and each and every item from beef and fish to the incredible vegetables were great we also tried some of the herb wine which was also delightful and distinctive they speak english and they are both friendly and helpful when it comes to explaining the menu i will return in a heartbeat, when we went it super crowded with chinese people which is always a good sign as it means the food is authentic and somewhat affordable the waitress who helped us spoke excellent english though she did keep trying to steer us toward the more expensive dishes the food and atmosphere are wonderful and i especially recommend the housemade rice wine, came across this place in my own and decided to give it a try the place was quite full so that was a good sign
extensive menu english speaking waiter and top notch traditional chinese food price can vary from plate to plate but the overall value is good as the food tastes fresh, excellent and refined food in a beautiful and cosy restaurant the staff is very nice
good place to relax and have a break while walking in the busy hutongs , our waitress was very bubbly and spoke wonderful english as she offered suggestions on what to order over all a very good meal the waitress was very accomodating for my mom who is a vegetarian will come back next time, awesome meal the food is great and very yummy the place maybe a little hard to find but totally worth it, i have already read of grandma creative kitchen when i accidentaly found it so i decided to try it
first it was a little difficult because the waitress that braught me the menu only spoke chinese the menu itself is a piece of art and it is also in english but she came back with another waitress that spoke excellent english
i tried her recommedations grandma fired secret recipe fish spring water stew beef and flavored rice wine granted it may seem a little bit too mutch for one person but after i finished there was not enough left for a doggy bag the food was really really excellent
the ambience is also fitting to the name you sit at some old kitchentabels around you a collection of potted plants and knickknack i was really comfortable there

conclusion it does not look like much from the outside since it is located in a side alley of the hutong so even if you have to look hard for it dont give up the food makes up for that a thousandfold also by eating there you are supporting a good cause grandma creative kitchen is a project for the elderly and students i will go there again and again and again actually i will go there today and i cannot wait, nice small location in the hutongs i tried different sake which was really good the dishes were good too same ingredients as other chinese restaurants are using but different flavour modern and delicious a bit pricey but worth to try, only slightly hidden in the hutong grandmas creative kitchen offers bountiful food and a unique service from a group of grandmothers  who will all crowd over your menu to argue over recommendations, the food is just as nice as the place the grandmas are super nice and good at recommending dishes as i was dining by myself she recommended the meal set i asked to change the meal set without any problems because i wanted to try the duck instead of chicken
would definitely come again, wow this place was really fantastic its kind of tucked away in a hutong but there are signs outside so its not hard to find once inside its a very nicely decorated space with a cozy vibe the menu is actually super cool because its hand drawn and each page has a ton of colors and great artwork

the food was really delicious and you can tell they use really high quality and fresh ingredients spice level wasnt super high but it had a kick i got the beef 75 rmb and the immortal vegetables 35 rmb along with some of the house made rice wine everything was absolutely fantastic the rice wine was really smooth and they have a bunch of different types to choose from

one of the best meals ive had in my 25 days in china will be back again soon, very nice place and friendly english speaking staff fired immortal vegetables dish was our favorite nice ricewine, we picked this restaurant based on trip advisor reviews they are in a hutong lane and is not easy to locate we found that they had extremely well drawn artwork on their menu the english speaking young lady is too aggressive and did not want us to read about what goes into the dishes but insisted we order first from the list of dishes we ordered fish and a couple of other dishes they all seemed to have same or similar tastes we certainly will not recommend this place for the quality of food if you are keen to take pictures of some interesting illustrations on their menu it may be well worth a visit, my travel style is to wonder to small alleys and avoid the tracks of the tour groups this chance discovery is a hidden gem
friendly english speaking staff  some english a varied menu in english and a large selection of cooked to order meals
i was resisting the hyped duck places so was very pleased to get a stewed duck leg in grandmas secret spice blend delicious
well worth seeking out, i definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone visiting in beijing hutong waiters are so nice and friendly, delicious and healthy food and very interesting homemade herb wine very good experience that i look forward to repeat, good food friendly staff restaurant was quite small but we could sit on the roof with view on the surrounding hutong the menu showed not only the dishes but also grandmas recipes  good for vegetarians, very good food reasonable prices
we took the duck everybody wrote about it was good but the raddish and the fried vegtebeles with the salad dressing were perfect, the environment is nice and food is tasty and not too spiced like the rest of the chinese food the staff speaks english and theyre helpful but we ordered some cold beers and they werent really cold, super friendly staff brilliant social enterprise and mission fantastic grandma artwork and sayings everywhere really big portions and excellent for vegetarians too go grandma, small place in an area where you feel in the real beijing the waitress is so smiling and friendly that she made our diner even better and the food is really tasty and i would personally say excellent  its a must to do the chinese wine is also very good i recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to eat, the food is great the black carp special was delicious bur a bit salty the fired pork is superb watch out for the portions they are generous

our server cherry is enthusiastic helpfui attentive and informative

i admit i am being bribed with a dessert but my wife and i were truly charmed by the food our server and the restaurant in general, came here according to tripadvisor reviews not disappointed very homemade tasting dishes great atmosphere and the staff is very welcoming would bring friends here again, lovely food great atmosphere and friendly staff i came here with my awesome son and this place is the bees knees the menu is small with the idea of quality of a quantity and oh boy was the quality up to mark thank you grandmas kitchen for making my trip to china that much more special, awesome just it the manager was very nice and helpful chicken dish set was tasty and fresh overall cool experience highly suggest visiting, the dishes give you the feeling that you are being fed by your beijing grandmother simple but delicious this restaurant located in the hutongs is amazing, cookies and comfort food are standard at grandmas house but the real draw point for this grandma is the rice wine we had the original and clove flavor and the flavor was to die for the dessert biscuits and roasted duck were very good as well very friendly staff and interesting history would come here again, perfect for the ones seeking for a twist on chinese food the food feels lighter than what we had before  and if you rate them on tripadvisor you can get a free dessert, nice surprise in this tiny restaurant menu looks beautiful and dishes have a wonderful taste i recommend the spicy eggplant dish and the flavored rice wine, and the food is almost as good nice presentation rich taste great staff and atmosphere a hidden gem, love the place and the food service with a smile wonderful restaurant after walking around the nearby lake, wow my husband and were just walking down the alley when we were lured in by the smell we were greeted with a warm smile that felt like an embrace and handed the menu which in itself deserves a review i ordered the charcoal roasted duck steak wild black tea and grandmas plum syrup two things ive never tried its a shame that they were both amazing and everything after will have a hard time living up to grandmas standards without a doubt we will come back it looks like a popular spot for the locals as well, this place is so great so glad we found it tucked away in a backstreet in the hutongs feels like youre having dinner in someones house great relaxed atmosphere dont be afraid of the streets even if they are a little dark

food is amazing packed with flavour and the portions are a really good size the menu isnt huge but thats a good thing menu is also in english and mandarin which is very helpful

highly recommended, we easily found it and the staff was very welcoming
the food was great we enjoyed all the specialities they recommended
our 12 year old son who isnt fond of vegetables said that was the best vegetables ever and licked the plate
the decoration is cosy
you really should go and try this delicious food the price are 12 the price of regular chinese restaurant for tourist, outstanding fresh food and exceptional service at a reasonable price highly recommended the staff is very kind and attentative to your needs the dishes are all made from fresh ingredients and prepared with a lot of love the restaurant is tucked into one of the little hutong alleys but it can be found easily by the signs put up in front of the door, had 3 dishes and the black tea rice wine the charcoal duck steak was probably some of the best duck weve ever had and overall this was one of the better meals in china, nice restaurant with traditional delicious chinese food set in the hutongs alleys of beijing owner is very nice and greets you with a smile i recommend that you try the rice flower wine its nothing like traditional wine but is instead made onsite with local flowers and other natural ingredients can be served warm or cold its surprisingly yummy when warmed the heat seems to bring out the flavors, great food friendly and interesting interior  all at a good price  served with a smile
we stumbled upon this lovely little restaurant whilst walking through the very interesting houtons in beijing
the restaurant eves some very authentic home cooked style food the menu is not huge which i like as it means each dish tends to be special
this was the case for the duck dishes which are their specialty
its also a great concept as the kitchen operates like a social enterprise helping young people to gain experience in the food business and it donates to the local elderly
all in all a recommended visit, good staff and delicious meal especially duck legs with carrots

i had the duck soup as a starter it was very mild and lacked any body however my main was a charcoaled chicken steak with some rice it was delicious i liked the decor of the restaurant and would go again my total bill with a soft drink was 58 yuan i also liked the ethos of the restaurant helping people in need

��, the taco bar in sanlitun is the place to go when you enjoy mexican food the service is good and the staff are very friendly when you go with a group make sure to book a table as they are often busy, well  not watered maybe margarita and beer is more the vibe the thing here is easy noisy fun not stiffs or toffs insight studenty is perhaps another way to describe it but that might be unfair as the tacos are really nice and the cocktails are top shelf simple wooden seats and tables food and drinks come fast easy

located close to the forbidden city you can see the roof of it
it is part of a chain where all of the restaurant are very good
location is very nice and it offer also a nice bar
food is good with a wide selection of dishes
good service
price very good for the quality and location, after having tried numerous restaurants in beijing i have turned to this highly rated restaurant in a porsche location we ordered many dishes which are innovative and were well satisfied that they also tasted as good as they looked the dishes were a bit small more of a tasting dish but the prices were still reasonable considering the location and decor it was a good experience overall and worth recommendation for a different food experience, the restaurant is located at the ex embassy of the united states a curious building in victorian style in the middle of the chinese capital in a few steps of the tiannamen square the food taste so amazing the soundtrack is just perfect and the decoration a must see, love this place location in the former quadrangle of a european embassy district magnificent ambience from the chairs to the cool plate covers and the decor uniquely attractive the food and service are as good as you will find anywhere in beijing the cocktails are outrageously good, made a reservation for 830pm on sunday night but could have got a table as not full the restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a good choice of food and drink which was excellent they speak english reasonably well so communication was easy and service was quick and efficient would recommend this place and would return on our next visit, this restaurant is located where the old us embassy built in the early 1900s used to be make sure you check out the architecture around food itself is great but on the pricier side its great for a romantic evening out since yunnan food is so different from mainstream chinese food you can always find something new to explore in this restaurant, food really disappointed us the most we were looking for fresh and flavourful yunan cuisine and we were served catering not warm food food was not made to order pork was dry and tasteless eggplant wasnt seasoned at all chicken was good but served too cold the atmosphere is kind of good but if you go for the food youll get disappointed wine was really good although overpriced ive had better food in other places around beijing if youre looking for good food this is definitely not the right place, went for dinner there and it was the best dining experience i had in beijing the restaurant had a lovely ambience very well decorated with exquisite ornaments and paintings upon arrival i was ushered to the 2nd storey the place was dimly lit but bright enough to see the menu it was my first time trying yunan cuisine and truth be told i had my reservations my husband and i ordered 4 dishes and we werent the least bit disappointed in fact we loved every single bit of it the price is very reasonable too we thought it would cost a lot more given the posh interior

i would definitely recommend this place and will go back again if i were to go to china this place has got me fallen head over heels with yunan cuisine, having visited the sister restaurant in the chain in shanghai the menu was excellent as expected full of interesting yunnan and burma vegetable dishes and plenty of fish and mean dishes too above average wine list the restaurant is to be found in a strangely quiet enclave near the centre in a compound that was built for foreign embassies in the late imperial era qing definitely worth a visit, good chinesse restaurant nice ambience and affordable prices perhaps not very easy to find you need to enter the square where the former us embassy was located after the security guard reservation adviced, the food is excellent and the service is good the wine was also rather good i was there with a group of people and we enjoyed the evening very much, i had the yunnan chicken salad with chilies and sesame seeds in a vinegar source really great blend of crispiness and spice the staff sometimes needs a bit of cajoling to get to the table but not a serious issue, taste experience from the south west province of china known as yunan bordering vietnam and burma as a result the flavours were a mix of the area and were truly a delightful experience ambiance was warm and inviting the restaurant was located in a beautiful courtyard wed return, the food was very good the highlight of which was probably the lamb samosas which came with a kind of tomatillo sauce delicious

only hiccup is that we had to return an entree that the waiter assured was not spicy because well it was really spicy for us

beautiful relaxed atmosphere

incredible bathrooms, loved the food ambience and the cocktails the service is wanting though was there on 12th november with a group and the service was wanting and i went back on 15 with one person and the service was much better, a delightful restaurant within the grounds of old american legation close to the qianmen subway station cuisine from yunnan tibet and myanmar very tasty and a splendid environment really worth a trip, spent 4 hours at the restaurant and bar very good food and service they told us when we had ordered too much and good wine selection for beijing prices were western but we expected this the bar was quiet but not their fault as was a wednesday night restaurant was busy terrific bar and a great scotch on the huge rock barman hand crafted an ice cube ball the size of a tennis ball  great touch as we were last ones in the bar we were even given permission to light up cigars highly recommended and tiananmen square just around the corner, my wife a friend that we met in beijing and i enjoyed our evening at lost heaven the decor is exotic but very comfortable the service was excellent and unobtrusive the food was of a very high quality it is heavily spiced so be prepared for that
the location of the restaurant is a bit difficult to find it is located within an inner courtyard so take a taxi that will make finding it much easier, this restaurant offered an outstanding atmosphere and very decent food would certainly recommend it to those who like to eat in a good romantic atmosphere, great place really tasty food lovely atmosphere and good service realtively well priced for beijing and easy to find location just off tianenmen square, well appointed restaurant with attentive staff many of whom speak english
the menu is varied and offers dishes in most categories food was wellprepared arrived ontime and was hot the soy chicken was especially delicious prices are midrange making this restaurant an excellent choice
however it is in a hidden away location and it is difficult to find transportation after dinner, beautiful place with very good foodbig choice of fishmeat and vegetables good drinks if the weather is nice they have a terrace, what an amazing dinner atmosphere and service if you must dine alone or with company the food is pricey but very nice and the night ambience is marvelous, this place was recommended by people we met at the black sesame kitchen it was a good recommendation the food is very good the restaurant is located in the old compound of the american embassy very close to tiannamen square it is darkly lit and the diners are largely tourists and visitors however the food is of a very high standard and the service is good it was not as a good as the black sesame kitchen and the atmosphere is perhaps a little austere but is a good venue for a nice dinner or a business dinner the food is varied and tasty it is regional food from yunnan province and is well prepared and presented and the portions are reasonably generous i would recommend ordering a selection and sharing we had 4 mains plus 2 vegetable sides dishes for six of us and it was more than adequate good place for dinner at night but also the kind of place you could have a business dinner or lunch, we had lunch during our recent this restaurant offered an outstanding atmosphere and very decent food would certainly recommend it to those who like to eat in a good atmosphere, we had dinner here recently and we were very pleased it is a beautiful clean restaurant and the food was fantastic we ordered 3 or 4 dishes to sample and they were all great the wait staff spoke english and were very courteous and helpful with our order large menu selection great service would recommend, amazing food focusing on dishes from the hunnan area we went on a sunday night but was still relatively busy would highly recommend the hit and sour soup
only downside was that service was a little slow, we enjoyed a special luncheon for our tour group just prior to the forbidden city visit we had a group of about 32 couples we were served family style most local favorites of chinese food the service was great the food was tasty and plentiful

never saw the bill but i assume it was expensivethe quality would justify the price i my opinion we would certainly go back again, went to this restaurant on our last night based on the excellent reviews here on ta

so firstly the restaurant as mentioned in other reviews is in a compound near maos mausoleum it is relatively straight forward to find and has signage out the front before you enter through the main gate overall though the restaurant is quite expensive for china though our mains varied from 128 yuan to 148yuan each

we had 1x entree which was the vegetarian bread with a tomato salsa overall pretty good but nothing exceptional

we shared 3x mains which were the spicy and sour prawns spicy beef stir fry and the chicken with green onion and chilli

the prawns and chicken were nice and i have to say we enjoyed them the beef however was a massive miss the beef itself was of poor quality and had more chunks of fat then actual beef maybe a case of ordering the wrong kind of meat certainly would not recommend anyone order a beef dish if eating here

we went on a saturday night at 1730 right when the restaurant opened there was plenty of space at the time but we were told we needed to leave by 1930 which was not an issue

the staff were also friendly and the food came quickly overall a decent choice based on the prawns and chicken we had, this was definitely one the best meals i have had in china the restaurant is a little tricky to find but i made it designed for drivers which i was not quite unusual food a bit of a fusion of chinese and thai style flavours absolutely delicious lovely surroundings and great service, a little difficult to find number 23 which is the old us embassy complex without the high recommendations on trip advisor we probably wouldnt have gone in it looks upmarket and is very nice and actually midpriced the drinks were especially expensive the food had vegetarian options and the staff were well versed re what vegetarians could and could not eat the vegetarian food we had was extremely nice and we would have no hesitation in recommending, booked at 745pm via our hotel and luckily got a table for 830pm on arrival the restaurant looked very civilised and was well appointed food was amazing my wife and i shared an eggplantaubergine and tofu salad slightly spicy but delicious and tofu was creamy and the prawn spring rolls which were tasty and had a great texture for main we shared the sliced pork very delicious with a broccoli side served slightly al dente and some steamed rice each to drink we had a berry cocktail and a passion fruit and ginger cocktail the dessert menu was a bit uninspiring  ice cream or fruit so we saved some calories service was friendly and attentive and they offered to call us a taxi after wed paid the bill note 10 off with visa platinum cards given the reasonable cost just under 400rmb for the quality of the food married to the great service from the staff a solid five star rating is well deserved i highly recommend, the food is good but its not the best yunnanese that ive had in beijing surprising light on mushroom and greens which i find are often the best dishes in yunnan anyway the venue more than makes up for it located in the former foreign legation district near tiananmen square if youre in the area its worth checking out, best restaurant in beijing at least what i tried the service was great the food amazing prices are totally worth it, good service of inexpensive well prepared food on quiet alcove near forbidden city mostly young couples enjoying a night out highly recommended, this should not be 8 for beijing its quite nice with nice decor food really just ok but in a nice spot staff nice and friendly bit expensive for what you get we liked the ribs but otherwise really pretty ordinary no need to book, was looking for great food and atmosphere and found it had read previous reviews and it sounded ideal and was not disappointed am soon in shanghai and cannot wait to test the rest of the the menu , from the start till the end fantastic food service and drinks
loved the ability of trying out different asia cuisines in same place
special mention to and reco for the following
chicken salad crab in tomato  coconut sauce the cocktails there was this one with watermelon gin chili lemon  coriander, this was by far and most certainly one of the top 3 x meals i have had ever i do love food so i dont say this lightly  
this is definitely among the spicier variety as far as eastern cuisine goes but the delicate blend of fresh chilli garlic ginger and coriander and blends together beautifully to create a taste explosion in your mouth ps  they do love their garlic so best make sure your significant other dines with you
the food was exceptionally tasty to the point that between the three of us we scooped up every last crumb and made sure that nothing went to waste the menu is not the cheapest but its not over the top expensive either at the end of it you dont just come here for a meal you come to a restaurant like this for an experience the drink prices are quite heavy though the beer we ordered came in a tiny dinky bottle for about 40rmb expensive if you compare it to some of the other places  but you dont really come here to get drunk either
it can be a little difficult to find if one member of our group didnt have an impeccable sense of direction and a map we would never have found it the cab could also only drop us off within a few blocks of tiananmen square the square and restaurant are a stones throw from each other  well worth visiting both in one go and make it an outing my suggestion would be to get a clear map and get as close as possible via the subway the roads surrounding the square are all barricaded at night which makes the area a little difficult to navigate
by far one of my favourite meals when next i find myself in china this will definitely be included on my todo list, service was good with sufficient english food was good too but not exactly heaven the tofu plate had an awkward consistency but beside of that we liked everything the place is worth a nice evening and considering the location you have to pay a bit more than usual for this kind of kitchen
dont miss the bathroom with its little surprises, this restaurant came highly recommended to me from the team at untour food tours in shanghai it did not disappoint  highly recommend the food tour also, living here in beijing we normally enjoy eating just the local fare but for a special occasion lost heaven is a great place to go to enjoy a great yunnan style meal from the decor to the food it is a wonderful place to dine with friends family or colleagues, a simple ordering of 1st and 2nd course and a small bottle of beer after a bit too long waiting arrived the 2nd course hey where the 1st course oh the waiter just forgot after another 5 minutes the salad came however i had to negotiate with the manager to get the already cold 2nd course replaced that was finally done people nicely dressed nice reddish design 160 yuan for the bill that is not too much tasty food but hard to imagine that this is a solid top10 restaurant in beijing, normally i dont like to compare but definitely shanghai branch is much much better service was bad and the food quality was just everage, went for a conference dinner very good selection and very tasty service was very good would recommend for large or small gathering, a very nice ambience restaurant you can choose to sit outdoor or indoor this resto is having authentic taste of yunnan food love their pancake and roasted pork, we visited this restaurant by the book lonely planet the restaurant has a lot of atmosphere darkness and candles and an east berlin feel to it  like so much in beijing a new and surprising mixture of communism and capitalism and classics old and modern the most amazing experience in this restaurant is provided by the toilet you see nothing of yourself in the frame where you expect a mirror because you see through to the mens it feels as if you have vanished my tofu dish was very jellypuddinglike when the waiter explained that the tofu was fixed with beef jelly i nearly choked on my food the vegetable dish was overcooked which happens very rarely in a chinese kitchen the cucumber soup was mainly hot and thin with little cucumber visible or tasteable the other guests just wanted to escape afterwards and did not even feel like a stroll in the splendidly lit tiananmen square nearby for a more happy experience go in for just for a drink the bar is very long and well stocked, nothing to do with the branch in shanghai food was ok but service was terrible very young inexperienced waiters the place is very nice and close to tian an men, always an authentic experience in a great setting server assisted in menu selection which added to the experience, although a few things on the menu are a bit hit and miss the majority of the dishes are phenomenal the chicken sesame salad and their speciality cocktail thai zeed is honestly one of the best ive ever had attentive service fantastic atmosphere and incredible value considering the quality of the dishes one of the things i miss most about not living in beijingchina anymore but when i fly back itll be the first restaurant i return to","Mexican cuisine",0.885634183472926

��, this is hidden away from the main drags so you have to go out of the way to find it unless youre looking for the british or vietnam embassy its worth the visit a great german food and drink experience in china theyve a wide range of german beers including dark beers which are a welcome change from the standard
��, we had a wonderful experience at schindlers please be sure to call ahead for a reservation wonderful mustard to have with sausage it is a great change from the other things in china mostly meat and potatoes food is excellent service was less than average, good german eatery good selection of beers its all about meat and potatoes in various shapes and forms good pretzels very generous portions decent prices inviting entrance but i was disappointed with the terrace it looks nicer from distance than a it actually is overall recommended if you crave some german food, i cannot quibble with the quality of the sausage or the beer at this restaurant so why the less than excellent rating because if i go out to a restaurant i want a little bit more than food i can always have food at home but at a restaurant i want a little atmosphere too honestly i did not find
��, we come to schindlers whenever we want a change from the local cuisine and want good food in large portions cant resist the schnitzel which i know is unimaginative but its very good as well as the beer german beer garden atmosphere and the local clientele seem to enjoy the place as much as the tourists ive been here 4
��, we passed by the restaurant by chance looking for the ritan park we just wanted to try it out but it was a very positive surprise the food is tasty and as german i can tell you that it comes very very close to the original german taste the services ist very friendly and quick and a good location, really tasty food at surprisingly reasonable price  white sausages with sweet mustard and schnitzel highly recommendable cosy atmosphere  try to get a table at the windows which is surrounded by nice fancy toys and oldstyle decoration, before eating here i thought that the german food was just wustel and sauerkraut really good the beers are good the atmosphere is good friendly and housy the waiters should improve a little bit the quality of their service, i can recommend the pork knuckle probably the best item to order beef roll excellent too however do not order goulash fat and gristle in more than 50 of the meat sauce was tasting badly too it spoiled what was a great night, popular with expats and locals this is the place to sit outside in summer drinking beer and eating pork all kinds of pork maybe any kind of pork i had a schnitzel but theres pork knuckle pork sausages get here early or you wont get a seat inside or out theres a pile of different beers does it really matter
��, the beer is great thats good enough reason to visit alone the neighborhood is great the atmosphere is great and the service too wiener schnitzel is very close to proper they are humble about it  they call it wienerart take a walk in the park after dinner its called the moon temple just through the park to the north
��, seems this restaurant is undergoing changes prices increased with lower value and quality meals and worse service got my gulasch moreorless cold reduced quantity and now cheapest indigrients its not a recommendation for german food anymore i admit schindlers is still better then other places or i should call it less worse the only reason i still go there is
��, i think its funny to come to beijing for excellent german food but there you go totally authentic lived in bavaria its like comfort food when away from home want to check out the lunch buffet the goulash was great and get sides the schweinehaxen was huge and full of flavor prices are moderate for beijing but if you want
��, the food is great its a great place to hang out with friends to knock down a few beers what separates this from all the other fake german want to be restaurants in beijing is its beer they actually import the beer from germany not a silly factory making it here in china you can see from their kegs and
��, the pork knuckles are awesome very tasty and tender never mild the name if you are looking for something a little different this is the place for you, location is great sit in the beer garden and look over the beautiful ritan park the beer garden is behind the a little boring front entrance this part is the reason why to visit this place and yes the german beer they offer is in a large variety and it is good the downside the food the food is average
��, so my german friend brought me here one night since we were both sick of our regular place both expats since then ive been three more times  its pretty good i actually like it a lot more than paulener bruhaus in liangmaqiao for a few reasons 1 they have real imported german wheat beers non pasteurized instead of the
��, lots of options at reasonable prices i though the sauerkraut with sausage was really good and the pretzel was yum very nice interior too, good solid food and plenty of it the kids particularly enjoy the mashed potatoes and the many different sausages i like the different snacks like fried mushrooms and aspargus with bacon nice and cosy place good service, excellent german food some days live music for sure on fridays good food for a reasonable price ill go there if i stay in beijing, it is ok german food for the price you pay nothing above the ordinary and a bit boaring the service
��, i ate here with a colleague on a business trip to beijing we are from usa this place has a great atmosphere think local german bar in milwaukee with a decent beer selection from germany and a very attentive staff if you are looking for a nice change of place from the local beijing cuisine i definitely recommend this place
��, schindlers its a very nice restaurant good german beer and food not expensive during the summer you may even sit outside on the rear enjoying a view from the ritan park, if you like meat sausages and piles of sloppy vegetables then this is your place if you like fine delicate flavours moderate portions then this is not your place, the tankstelle is typically german and provides a good atmosphere mr schindler has a number of outlets in beijing and is obviously very successful with a good formula he also has a butchery and this probably accounts for the excellent quality of the meat courses the decor is typical of a german beer garden and fits very well with the

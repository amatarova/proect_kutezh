"If you want good ramen this place is for you. Perhaps a little hard to find down in the basement but worth the search. Our group ordered a variety of dishes and were extremely happy with all of them. Best part about the Beijing location is that you don't have to wait for three hours in line like the suckers...

"Love this place, the ramen is delish ! you can specify the cook you want on the noddles and try the Basil lime soda, waiters do not speak much English so it's good to have a translator on hand. Much better than the ramen in the village, worth the detour !","5 из 5 кружков","7B888591C4A6056D8B7C87D37A2A9F13","Отзыв написан 5 августа 2014"
"Tried the ramen and the dumplings. Tasted good. Same taste as in Hong Kong with a lower price tag. Cosy place yet a bit cramped. Wifi in Kerry Centre was fast but was disconnected every 20 minutes or so.","4 из 5 кружков","094C1FA002BDFE22AB3DDAEEA474B53E","Отзыв написан 27 июня 2014"

"Do not expect a fancy restaurant for a special occasion. This is a noodle soup (Ramen) shop and the taste is excellent. The atmosphere is a like a typical japanese noodle shop and also the service is good. Expect a waiting line if You come during rush hours as the word is spreading fast.","4 из 5 кружков","3216434F47339AD9D40E168D3920EE44","Отзыв написан 17 мая 2014"

"Had dinner here with friends. First of all, a relief if keeping kosher is important to you. Large restaurant, can accommodate large groups, though we were six together with few other diners present. Comfortable seating, easy to converse. Chinese, Hebrew and English spoken, so no difficulty communicating. Menu is multilingual with photos. Service was good; food was okay, prices reasonable...

"Traveling to China, you're grateful for anything Kosher you can get, and this is pretty good. The menu is a little limited, but what they have is tasty. The prices are reasonable and they will also do takeout, prepare sandwiches, and provide for all your Kosher needs. WARNING - THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS, accepting only cash, although they...

"Dini’s would be a great Restaurant even if it were located in NY or Jerusalem. You will find a great helpful staff that will go out of their way to assist you in any way possible. They will give you the Wi-Fi password, call a taxi, etc. I have encountered all kind of Jews at Dini’s, from Non-Religious to Ultra-Religious...

"Неплохой мясной ресторан, как я поняла, единственный кошерный в Пекине. Находится при Хабадской общине. Перед посещением зайдите на сайт, так как в данный момент он на ремонте и работает только на доставку и для шабатних трапез","3 из 5 кружков","34C59709780747D63D54FBC854CB1301","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2014"
"We went on Thursday night, which they advertised as barbecue night on the website. Getting there was an adventure as the taxi driver made his way through rush hour towards the airport. We were the only customers in the restaurant that night. There was neither beef nor barbecue available. We each had different chicken dishes - hamburger, schnitzel, chicken with...

"Dishes were so plentiful, that two people could have shared one dish and be satisfied, The chicken we ate was tender with spicy sauce. Prices were reasonable.

"Thanks Dini for making my stay so much easier. The Friday night atmosphere is the closest you will get to feeling at home with your family. During the week the meaty restaurant is open 18:00-22:00. The menu has both Asian dishes (Sushi, GongBao) and Israeli dishes (Shnitzel). Highly recommended!","5 из 5 кружков","84E3906E1DA5D0ECBF705D0F400563B2","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2013"
"If you are keeping Kosher but want to taste some Chinese food, this is your chance. The place is very clean, and is worth to eat there even if you don't keep Kosher. In addition there is a small shop with various Kosher products.","5 из 5 кружков","CDB3A5E541B7FF5F5EE37CE19D676933","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2013"

"I was very pleasantly surprised to find such a nice and hygienic kosher restaurant in that part of the world. The prices were very reasonable, and the food was really great. They also cater shabbat meals (that can be prepaid), and has a lovely atmosphere, meeting people from all over the world. All by all a 5* experience !","5 из 5 кружков","228263795B5638883EDE2DDA1C07EDB9","Отзыв написан 4 ноября 2011"

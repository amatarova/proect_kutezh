I highly recommend this...

"Not easy anywhere in China to get quality imported wine at a reasonable price, so it was a real surprise to see a short and focused winelist and a super selection of wines by glass, including Dr. Loosen and Donnhoff from Germany, Pascal Jolivet from France and the iconic Cloudy Bay. Glasses were of excellent quality, service from the very...

"Aria has all it takes to favorably impress your Chinese collegue or client, and at the same time you are 100% in your comfort zone with knives and forks and spoons, fine wine, sufficient but not extremely heavy dishes, soft music, 5*staff and really good seats. A two hour lunch is well within reach if you slow down the efficient...

"We went for lunch at the bar and order the squid ink pasta<U+3002>The set with one side dish salad and soft drink costs 99 RMB Net. The salad was ok BUT the pasta is not.

"The Aria bar never changes, at least not the last 8 years. Knowledgable bar tenders, friendly waitresses. Some of them even speak a bit of English. An outside seating was offered this hot fall. Notably the complimentary nuts were downgraded, possible reflecting a new economic reality? Prices did not change much, decent cocktail at 80 RMB.","3 из 5 кружков","58766AC30AD7D07D704DDC8C17A1977F","Отзыв написан 17 сентября 2016"

"The Aria is the breakfast restaurant for the hotel guests that are not in the Horizon club. Breakfast is good (not brilliant) but as a la carter lunch place there is no sense and that seems to influence staff as well.

"I was at Aria 2 years ago and it was outstanding. This time there were a couple of issues. The food was still nice but the staff was not great. Several of the wines I tried to order from the wine list were not available.

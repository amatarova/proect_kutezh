"Black Sesame is a must do in Beijing for authentic and tasty food in a really unique environment with local Chinese chefs cooking in front of you. We had a fantastic evening!","5 из 5 кружков","1C1C6CC4D460FE8F401E1F4A299C219D","5 марта 2017"
"Me and my partner went to Black Seasame kitchen and absolutely loved it! We both loved having the set menu cooked in front of us, it meant we could try new things and Coco speaks very good English and takes time to explain each dish. The fact it was communal made it very sociable and a good way to meet new people.. overall a great experience, amazing food and Coco is a wonderful host! I would definitely return","5 из 5 кружков","AD2F66CB74B4AAF59C607C20733B6F75","3 марта 2017"
"The food is very, very good. And served in large quantities, so there are a lot of good things to say about this place. You sit around a table and meet people from all over the world, which can be good or bad in itself I suppose. But I will suggest two things to the place, and a note to those who come. There is a host, and her name is Coco. She is very, very nice. But there is only one of her and two tables full of people. She simply can't tend to everyone at both tables. Glasses were regularly empty. Plates that needed to replaced were not. People had to ask repeatedly for these things, which are often taken for granted at restaurants. I think the place needs an assistant to Coco and things would be fixed. But until then, be prepared to sit with an empty glass or waiting for Coco to return. The second, smaller but somewhat related, the alcohol policy is not clear. They have wine, and beer is also offered at the start. But it's not clear what is included. And with the lack of attentiveness to an empty glass, it's not clear what path one should take. I would like to suggest something much more simple, like other places, where alcohol is ordered and added to the bill for those who want it. As it is, some people want it and end up having to wait for Coco to come refill when she gets a chance. Better to just place a bottle with the diner and let them manage.","4 из 5 кружков","B5554D2AAA4D355118C655ED14B8EBFA","27 февраля 2017"
"Locating the hutong: Coco’s email with directions is very clear. Download a local mapping app to get to the “Red Wall Hotel” and that puts you at the end of the alley or hutong. Go down the alley from the Red Wall Hotel about 0.25 miles, and Coco’s gate is on the left side of the alley and has lights on it.

Arrival/hostess service: Coco greeted us warmly. We were the first to arrive, and she let us choose which of the two dining rooms we wanted. We chose the dining room without the kitchen.

Overall dining experience: Coco and staff are generally gracious. The meal is served family style in successive courses. If you want a chair with a back, arrive early so that you can select your seat. Otherwise, late comers will end up with a less comfortable seat.

Is the price worth the experience? BSK is highly ranked on TripAdvisor, but we think it’s overrated and overpriced. If you’re comfortable getting around Beijing on your own and not afraid, then the price is not worth the experience. We found fantastic, comfortable, high-end restaurants with delicious food at much lower prices around Beijing. You’re paying for an experience and a name rather than just quality food. Also, you’ll be seated family style with a bunch of yuppies. Our table included conceited German consultants, rich housewives from the U.S., and others. After a few drinks, some of the table guests were nearly insufferable.

Ambiance: quaint and inviting like a family dinner table

Service: Good service generally but refills of beverages could be better timed. Also, Coco refused to call a cab for anyone. That seemed a bit odd. It took us over 30 minutes wandering around the desolate streets near the hotung to get a cab back to our hotel after dinner.

Food: Don’t worry about the portions. The food is plentiful and overall very good. The best dishes included the spicy beef with Hangzhou peppers, the red braised pork belly (Chairman Mao’s favorite food), and dessert. Our ten course meal consisted of the following:
1. Pan fried dumplings- pork and pumpkin
2. Fried shitake mushrooms
3. Beef with hangzhou peppers
4. Five-flavored eggplant
5. Red braised pork (Hong Shao Rou)
6. Wok fried green beans
7. Shelled shrimp with carrot and cucumber
8. Sweet and sour lotus root
9. Kung pao spicy chicken
10. Candied sweet potato black sesame ice cream

Cleanliness (overall): Clean overall but not spotless

Bathrooms: There’s a small toilet room outside in the courtyard.

Misc: Bring cash to pay. Tipping is not expected. We gave Coco some extra and she neither acknowledged the gratuity nor thanked us.","4 из 5 кружков","6DB5436929F4EF8EE03F210AD6EA6339","26 февраля 2017"
"We had a fabulous meal here. We found the restaurant on Trip Advisor and we're not let down. Coco was a great hostess, each dish perfectly cooked and served. You need to book, Coco speaks excellent English. However, it is very tricky to find, down a long back Street with no sign in English on the door. We had the set 10 course menu that was the only menu on offer and sat at a communal table. This all worked very well. We were served Australian wine which was delicious too. I would definatly visit here again.","5 из 5 кружков","4D7B762E370C57CE4B809E4AE8010319","17 февраля 2017"
"Been at Black Sesame Kitchen a few times now with friends, we had enough people together to book the large table with the show kitchen and life cooking
Great to see the food prepared life, very tasty Chinese, great atmosphere and Coco is a fantastic host.
Book in advance for larger groups, and check when they have reservations for smaller groups and couples, as BSK is a great place to connect with others visiting and living in Beijing.
The ice-cream in the end was the best!","5 из 5 кружков","541F4C6F98FAF9960B9B6D5DCF34ED37","15 февраля 2017"
"If you are planning to go here it is a must do. You will need to book well in advance as it is so popular. Situated at No.28 Zhonglao Hutong in a very old part of the city. We discovered part of the restaurant was attached to the original city wall and several hundred years old..
We arrive a little early and met a great lady Coco who speaks great English which was good for us as I cannot speak Chinese! Coco gave us a tour of the complex then went about setting up for the other guests. We were lucky as when more guests arrived the other areas were closed off.
Once inside we were seated at a table for twelve but they managed to squeeze two more in.
We sat near the preparation area and watched the chefs prepare and cook the food there was also a mirror above the chefs so every body could see the food being prepared.
The meal was served in individual portions that were perfectly blended, there is no fixed menu it depends what ever the chef's decide to cook on the day. There was also international wine to be served with the meal we were told which was a treat but when they served it the was from a winery just 20 kilometres from where we live but very nice all the same. We ate and chatted to people from all over the world and at 10.00 pm Coco phoned a taxi for us and were escorted through the Hutong by one of the staff to the Uber taxi point and set off home fat and fed.
It was a great night and a fantastic experience well worth the cost.","5 из 5 кружков","F6032882E1D1CAB1CAA5F29444D0DCF0","Отзыв написан 18 января 2017"
"Even i had been living in Beijing for 3 months and i had tried over 40 restaurant in this city and many others in China, i would rate this Black Sesame Kitchen is the best one.

"If you want to have a lot of chinese food and watch how the chefs are making it, this is the place to go. The host is super nice and tell you stories about traditional China.

"This place was one of the highlights of our trip to China and really made me appreciate Chinese cuisine and ingredients a lot more.
For 300 yuan you get to try 10 different dishes, cooked right in front of you so you can ask questions and pick up some ideas for cooking at home.
The host, Coco, speaks great English and is lovely to chat to and the chef and his team are a treat to watch at work.","5 из 5 кружков","A8D4A2B758E2BCE9DE2401803A7A102E","Отзыв написан 24 декабря 2016"
"We ate dinner here on our last night in Beijing! The 10 courses were all cooked right in front of us and they were by far the best food we had in Beijing. Each course was better than the next. We enjoyed talking with other tourists from all parts of the world since we shared one table. Definitely a very fun experience with great food and an informative host! I would recommend taking a map to find it since it is in the residential area which is a little hard to drive in, even for taxis. Highly recommend getting a reservation and enjoying the evening!","5 из 5 кружков","6E71E2EC37689F762F373B149514E43F","Отзыв написан 22 декабря 2016"
"Black sesame is an amazing place with a great atmosphere, fantastic food and free flowing drinks.

The Pork and ice cream are my favorites, but all the dishes are amazing. A great place to take family, friends and colleagues for a special experience","5 из 5 кружков","1561B2948ED66DDAEEFFAD58F42DA669","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2016"
"First of all, I am a Chinese, so I am very familiar with all those dishes they serve. The food is nothing special or extraordinary, however, the dinning experience in a private kitchen in Chinese courtyard is just very interesting. They only serve 16 people every night, the interaction between guests and host, Coco, and the chef is very interesting to me. Besides, wine is included in the dinner, the price for this dinner is very affordable. Last but not least, the dish that blows my mind away is the black sesame ice cream, I had 3 scoops, oops~ so good!","4 из 5 кружков","DBD76DA98E23C65A868DBDBD2D9504FB","Отзыв написан 9 декабря 2016"

"It is difficult to add anything to the reviews which have preceded which have captured the uniqueness and charm of this eating experience. Although I understand the menu can vary, here are the ten courses we were offered: Pan fried pumpkin & pork dumplings; fried shitake mushrooms; beef with Hangzhou peppers; five-flavoured eggplant; red braised pork; wok fried green beans; shelled shrimp with carrot & cucumber; sweet and sour lotus root; Chongqing spicy chicken; candied sweet potato & home-made Black Sesame ice cream. Every dish a delight with a couple being firey so beware if that is not your taste. We were a group of 6, we loved every moment watching the chefs prepare the food, conversing with new-found acquaintances next to us and listening to Coco's explanations and comments. If you have the opportunity, make a date to visit Black Sesame- you won't be disappointed!","5 из 5 кружков","A07D239710307E8C961DE0867B433989","Отзыв написан 5 декабря 2016"
"You need to get there with gps ( 1st tip). We went without a reservation But I do not recommend That since it is a tasting food type of restaurante And everbody booked it in advance. Only 2 long tables ( ours had only 10 people ). We were very lucky because there had been 2 last minute cancellations And we could enjoy a 10-course Chinese meals from different parts of Chine, including an amazing dessert, open bar for wine &beer.
Both waiters were incredibly nice And attentive, explaining the different Dishes And even telling us How to Cook them And the recipes! Ese were next to the cooks who worked in front of us in an open kitchen. During the morning in this place u get cooking lessons And at night the teachers are the cooks! You Also get to speak to the people around u. We personally had a really good night with our neighbours who were 3 Funny And nice swedish people. A 10/10 experience! Really really recommend it!","5 из 5 кружков","49F43713B89F5647EA1E81A7D6AB7139","Отзыв написан 4 декабря 2016"
"This restaurant, located down a small alley and in a hutong lives up to it’s billing and then some as one of the best in Beijing. Coco was a wonderful and gracious host and even let us give a couple of things a try in the kitchen ourselves. We went on Friday night to the group wine and dine dinner and loved it so much we sent our hiking friends there on Monday when they got back into the city. Needless to say, they fell in love with the place as well!","5 из 5 кружков","5AB01FFBF9FC546DE6C72D9CDB236B1B","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"
"Thank you Coco and team for a really fabulous evening. An opportunity to eat freshly prepared Chinese food in an excellent hutong setting. Good variety of dishes, great wines and the company is what you make it...communal dining at its best! Recipe books on sale! Would certainly go back. Fantastic way to end of a wonderful weekend in Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","25A163C0FCD3A37E5564F747EADF6341","Отзыв написан 28 ноября 2016"
"We weren't sure what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised at how fun and interesting this dinner turned out to be. BSK serves communal style dinners in a hutong courtyard with a prix fixe menu and wine pairings. The food was really delicious authentic Beijing cuisine paired with Australian wines. The company was really fun as its always fun to compare notes with fellow travelers while ""breaking bread."" Coco, the organizer/proprietress was fabulous! If you want a really unique experience and enjoy meeting fellow travelers, this is a very fun way to spend an evening in Beijing.","4 из 5 кружков","285A35C61D9EDB5B8FA3A592B0F14935","Отзыв написан 26 ноября 2016"

"i was originally looking at black sesame for a cooking class, but when i researched the communal dinner further, i was sure this was for us. located on a hutong, or side alley, finding this restaurant was a fun part of the experience. we arrived a little early and had time to watch the chefs at work in the kitchen, viewing their techniques. we then sat down at a large table for the thirteen total guests who made up this group and were offered our choices of wine. the dishes followed in rapid succession including dumplings, five flavored eggplant, red braised pork belly and other dishes. completely satiated, we were finally tempted with dessert...black sesame ice cream and candied bananas! not only was this a great feast, but it was also a wonderful social gathering of travelers from around the world. why go out to a restaurant when you could be doing this instead!!","5 из 5 кружков","2A86CD43F6C5AF6D8AEB48AD40AA9451","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"
"Our good friend recommended that we try Black Sesame Kitchen during our recent visit to Beijing.

It was a very interesting experience even though I have lived in Beijing before. The slow walk into the Hutong with the crisp cool climate slightly dark as we try to anticipate the evening.... greeted by 2 red Chinese lamps at the small entrance door...

The food served up was typically home-style Beijing dishes... some with a twist. I enjoyed the eggplant, beef & stewed pork dishes. Their home-made black sesame ice cream was heavenly.

What made the evening more memorable was the excellent service. The staff were one of the friendliest I've ever encountered. Always ready to make your evening better.

All in all, a fantastic first dinner in Beijing worth coming back again.","5 из 5 кружков","44070CA07036CBE387E0B5203444B96F","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2016"
"Located in an alleyway near the forbidden city this gem of a restaurant provides for a truly unique dining experience! Communal dining, a 10 course meal includes wine and beer.

"After 2 weeks traveling around China we ended our fabulous stay at The Black Sesame Kitchen. What a send off! As other reviewers have noted, it is hard to find but we all did because Coco sends an email with instructions in Chinese. So after we got out of the taxi we showed someone in the street the email and they pointed us in the right direction for the alley. After walking a minute or so and wondering if we were in the right place, we saw lights and two red lanterns outside and all was well. The concept is great, especially if you enjoy talking with people from around the world. This place caters to travelers but we brought a local Chinese friend who said the food was very authentic - very much what families would enjoy at home. Its not a restaurant - its literally a kitchen with a big communal table that seats around 16-17 people. I was sitting near 6 women from Finland who come to Beijing every year - this was their fifth time eating here! Do pace yourself as I was a bit too full to enjoy the last few dishes but the black sesame ice cream for dessert was to die for. Everything was delicious and I would highly recommend dining here.","5 из 5 кружков","F44335AF186CC22A84B2AF986A2955EC","Отзыв написан 8 ноября 2016"
"We booked a table for 7 via email, the manager coco was articulate and clear in her communication in English. We had a fantastic night, served a 10 course meal. Each course made in front of you by the chefs. Its best to go as a group I feel as there is one huge table, so going as a couple wouldn't be as easy. The beer and wine was included in the cost (rmb600 pp). The hostess Coco really does a great job of working the room, without it feeling too staged. The hutong has two large tables in rooms on either side of a courtyard. Its hard to find, and there is no sign on the door, you just have to find the alley and look for number 28. It should be noted that this food isn't Michelin style, it's generally simple traditional chinese food from various provinces, all done to perfection. Ending with their famous black sesame ice-cream. A lovely evening had by all, many thanks !","5 из 5 кружков","7F635FCD2769445843C0F744AE758298","Отзыв написан 7 ноября 2016"

"This dining experience wasn't what I expected, as it was so much more and better. The food was excellent and cooked right in front of the communal table. Quality of the dishes was what it should be given such a high ranking. What was such a delightful addition to the experience was the feel that you are eating at a friends house. There were three groups of people at our table, and while cramped, it didn't feel too stuffed. The service was personable and efficient. While i drank the wine, I do wish they had liquor as an option, but that is a small price to pay. It was about$50 USD which was a bargain for what we got. Hard to find but well worth the effort. A true must for anyone looking for a great dining experience in Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","130EAED5173A41AB2151DEAB7D1A9EA7","Отзыв написан 29 октября 2016"
"This was actually the best meal(s) we had in China!! The food was incredible (dumplings and sesame ice cream were a highlight!), but what really made the whole evening was Coco and the team in the kitchen.

You would definitely be missing out if you don't spend a good part of your evening chatting away with Coco (and other diners as it's a communal table!), as she has a great wealth of knowledge on so many things and has a very sweet personality.

We met some great people and we won't forget this evening for a while :)

Great value for money with around 7-8 courses and costs something like <U+00A3>30 per person including wine and beer.","5 из 5 кружков","CDD645CCD4B402709AABA09FF2D357D0","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"
"We had lunch at the Black Sesame Kitchen. Yue, the manager was outstanding in attending to the customers. They had only 12 seats open for lunch and we (my wife and I) were there was another group of six Koreans. Very cosy place with good range of dishes with free flowing wine. Enjoyed the kindness of Yue. I was surprised when she said we could consumer all the wine we wanted. We told her that we were worried that the kitchen might go broke. She mentioned that happy customers were very important for the restaurants.

"We went to Black Sesame Kitchen after reading all of the great TripAdvisor reviews, and weren't disappointed. It's hard to describe the experience other than comparing it to having an amazing dinner party at a good friend's house. Black Sesame Kitchen is located on a secluded street very close to the Forbidden City. You literally eat in a kitchen with a large communal table that seats about 25 people, who become your friends by the end of the night. The day's menu is on the blackboard, and food keeps coming out 1 course at a time. Each course was amazing, however even more amazing is the gracious hosts that run the restaurant. I am in Beijing about twice a year, and this is a new ""must stop"" whenever I am in town.","5 из 5 кружков","8FF8CE1E408A37C60ED3B9DD5D5DC516","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"

Coco works to bring everyone together, and we had a superb evening of food, fun and conversation. The food is superb and well presented. We had 12 courses, unlimited wine and beer and great company for 300Yuan per head. The meal is served in a room with just one table, we all sit together and the atmosphere is highly convivial.

It was a little difficult to find but having received directions from Coco (our lovely host) and with the help of some locals we were managed to find the right place.

The experience was absolutely amazing. Coco was such an incredible host making sure that everyone at the dinner table was happy with their meal and drinks. She made sure that the work good substitutes for me to considering me and my sister are vegetarians. It was nice to dine with other travellers in an intimate setting.

"Having stayed in Beijing for almost 4 years I was introduced to Black Sesame Kitchen by a friend and loved it ! Last week, I took 3 of my other friends to this place and the love it too ! Coco the attendant was excellent. She is so accomodative and gave me several options when I was trying to make reservations. Food and service was great and to top it all, we met new friends travelling from Australia, London and California.","5 из 5 кружков","C35C37BC0DA178FF272E534507741457","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2016"
"If you're traveling to Beijing, particularly with a group or a few other people, I highly recommend booking the cooking class plus dinner at Black Sesame!

We went here as a group of friends and family and this was one of the highlights of my entire trip to China!

The restaurant is located in one of the hutongs in Beijing, and the home-style feeling of the space is incredibly charming. We began the night with dumpling making class, no cooking skills required!

The host of the evening was incredibly friendly, kind, and attentive to everyone in our party. (Note: We were a group of English speakers, and her English was excellent!)

After preparing dumplings (which would later be cooked and served to us as part of our meal!), we moved to the dining room for dinner. We could watch the cooks making each course, and the preparation and cooking techniques would be explained as we went through each course. The food was incredible!! We loved some of the dishes so much, we were even able to get the recipes after the meal.

I highly recommend spending an evening at Sesame Kitchen. It was my favorite meal in Beijing, and one of the best activities of my trip to China!","5 из 5 кружков","966D711B7D8875E151C05E2BE84D34B9","Отзыв написан 14 сентября 2016"
"All 10 courses were amazing. The staff was so friendly and nice. We met so many interesting other people. It was a bit tricky find with no sign but definitely worth it!","5 из 5 кружков","3EC2A4A59FAAB4E929D171BC04F96757","Отзыв написан 13 сентября 2016"
"I understand why this experience may have mixed reviews. I was hesitating between 3 and 4 stars. I gave it the 4 stars because of Coco's personality and her arranging for my husband and I to have a mini dumpling cooking class before dinner. The group we had really made this experience a good one. They were all great conversationalists and we laughed a lot. We actually ended up going to a bar after dinner with some of the people we met. The food was ok... Besides the dumplings, nothing else was exceptionally good in my opinion. The other host who was in charge of pouring the red wine kept giving us about an ounce at a time.. it felt like he was trying to give us a little as possible... That was a bit offsetting. I'm glad we did it but I'm not sure that it's worth the price it costs.","4 из 5 кружков","AD31FA6B185DE4BA75A16508BAE76768","Отзыв написан 6 сентября 2016"
"This place is a tourist trap set up for non locals. The communal dining experience is a nice chance to meet new people and the hostess Coco is nice but it's not worth the money. The food is very soso and not tasty authentic local food that it is made out to be. The price at Y300 per head is more than double the price we paid for much tastier meals at other local Beijing restaurants.","1 из 5 кружков","1BFB8AC08FE3E84565AB0F7F030465F3","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2016"
"A MUST do in Beijing. I stumbled upon this place randomly while searching the internet for night out in the hutong and i ended up getting a lot more than I expected. this very cute place is actually your own restaurant for the night. you will learn how to make your own dumplings and then you'll be served a 10 course meal. all delicious and authentic Chinese food. The staff and particularly the host Coco is lovely and makes sure you have a great night. her English is perfect. the setting in a little courtyard in the heart of the hutongs couldn't be better: go for it! This was really the highlight of my 3 Beijing trips!","5 из 5 кружков","84C3C349EC139FE2BB3126368CD8DCE2","Отзыв написан 2 сентября 2016"
"We did the communal dining option on our first day and we loved it. It was a cosy and intimate intro into Beijing & Chinese history and good culture and we really appreciate Coco's easy going nature and expire guidance about almost all things China. We also got to swap ""war"" stories from fellow travellers from around the world in a communal setting, which was great! We also signed up for the cooking class but unfortunately that was canned because of a lack of interest. Overall, the communal dining experience is one that shouldn't be missed!","5 из 5 кружков","08DF4A17F4E747690C89A5806BBB308E","Отзыв написан 26 августа 2016"

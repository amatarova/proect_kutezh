"This 24/7 place is known to be busy and so it was when we visited. After a 10 minutes wait for a table we were asked to sit down. The only problem was that it was not cleaned from the previous diners. Sitting watching all the food bits and pieces all over the table was truly off putting. I noticed...

"We visit this whenever we're in Beijing. Always busy and not always easy to get a table but the quality of the food is always great. We love the shrimp dumplings, pork soup dumplings ,scallion pancakes, double deep fried beans with pork to name a few.

"Love the place. Got recommended by the concierge at the Hotel. Love the concept, love the ambience, LOVE the food. Don't get scared by the huge menu and, usually, 3-4 items per person should work, especially if you get only the ""dim sum"" part of the menu. Don't get scared by the personnel. They are running all over and are...

"I was invited here by work colleagues after giving a talk at UIBE. What a crazy place! We did have to wait about 15 minutes, but it gave me time to take some photos and people watch outside. The restaurant is noisy and full of atmosphere but the food is truly authentic Chinese, or rather Cantonese. For Western tastes, some...

"Brilliant service although you will need to wait for a table as its one of the most sort after restaurants in Beijing. There is a helpful ticket and waiting service and there is plenty of entertainment outside to enjoy whilst you wait. The food is definitely worth the wait as it the atmosphere inside. Its warm and cozy with incredible...

"Found out when I went to Beijing that Dim Sum was an American thing! Well luckily Jin Ding Xuan was there! So good we ate there twice. Very Famous restaurant and easy to find (right at the mouth of the Temple of Earth park). We got about 8 dishes the first day (Between me, my girl, and VivieTour guide). Crushed...

Won't recommend any travellers to make the extra effort unless you really want dim sum.

"I often say the local is like the Applebee's of Beijing, and I mean that in the BEST way possible. It's a home away from home - not flashy, cultured, or sophisticated - but it's reliable and it's comfortable. Also FYI: everyone who visits Beijing needs to try a Naughty Pear... Life. Changing.","5 из 5 кружков","7221F1C93BBF8D52B7C07A55E3226F6C","Отзыв написан 7 сентября 2016"
"This is the place to come for an excellent beer and watch sports. And not only that. There are happy hour deals and well priced food. Good selection of beers. I have mostly eaten burgers here (classic cheese burger and avocado burgers). They were both tasty, meat was done as it should be. Note that usually the place is not...

"The bar is nice however when busy difficult to get a table inside for the air conditioning. The range of beers is great including local beers on Tap and Cider. I have now visited 3 times and the Cheese Burger is very good, (in my top 5 for Beijing). And in summer the draft cider is very good. Recomend a...

"This place has come a long way in 2 years! And I mean a long way! New branding, new upstairs patio and a new menu. My husband, the non salad eater, won't stop telling people, (sometimes strangers) how good the Blue Cheese and Apple Salad is. Personally I'm a fan of the Hummus Wrap, that comes with a healthy dose...

"Let me start at the beginning. I crave authentic buffalo wings more then any other food. I was mesmerized that this place carries my favorite beer and buffalo wings. There is a LARGE variety of cheap drinks during happy hour and anything from steaks to bar food and pizza. There is a pool table which is free to play at......

"Read a lot of good reviews so went there with some expectations. The place is nice, the atmosphere is cool until it gets too crowded but the food was really disappointing. The hamburger was uneatable. Maybe our expectations were too high. We will not come again.","3 из 5 кружков","D259EF0A9EBC4FC93DE3A8726AAF0D66","Отзыв написан 22 февраля 2016"
"Went twice there, had some-not-so-cheap beer, but didn't find it inviting enough for eating. Once there was so cold inside, that everybody were sitting in their winter jackets. I'll not going third time and that's a pity, cause the location it's very convenient to me.","1 из 5 кружков","287D6BF2859947403B8F5ED15D1954AE","Отзыв написан 5 декабря 2015"
"I have been to the Local quite a few times and its a great place for an afternoon beer at the weekend or for a beer in the evening. The place has a good atmosphere and the staff are always on hand to take your order. I have only eaten here once before and had a rather forgettable Macaroni Cheese....

"Really nice bar in a great location in Beijing. Good drinks selection with fair prices. Multiple screens for sports viewing. Pool table.. What really sets it apart from other places in Beijing is the authentic Buffalo wings which are half priced on Wednesdays. The burgers are also award winning although these days you can get pretty good burgers just about...

"This place has absolutely one of the best burgers in Beijing. When you also consider they make slamming nachos, a buffalo chicken sandwich good enough to make you slap your mama, pizza for pizza lovers, beef tacos that are some of the best in the city and wings that would make a wing lover cream their shorts, there isn't much...

"It has a good mix of drinks, and a good happy hour going between 5pm-8pm. Food is average to great depending on the dish. The steak with blue cheese is very good. They have international sport on the screens so its good for expats. There are a couple of outstanding servers who care and are professional but sadly most of...

"Second night in Beijing and our son took us to one of their recommended jaunts. It's a westernised type bar and grill with a pool table in one corner. Service was quick and the food cooked was for me to perfection. I went for the grilled Salmon with lemon sauce and was not disappointed. Infact it was one of the...

"I come here for lunch or occasionally dinner, and the food is definitely okay. But the real star here is their huge list of drinks and beers. They don't have many beers on tap, but the place makes up for it with the many in bottles that they carry. Plenty of imported, and local craft brews (including those on tap)...

"A great place for travelers from the US or Europe to kick back and enjoy a few well-poured pints or cocktails or for those homesick for a little Western comfort food. The staff, led by managers Kenn and Martin, offer good service by Beijing standards and a well-stocked bar. The bourbon iced tea and the old fashioned are house specialities....

For main, I had a...

"This review is a little late because the new year has been crazy but I haven't forgotten about the wonderful time we had celebrating NYE at the BLD. For a fantastic price of Y588 which included a very wide spread of high quality foods and free flow wine, it was the best way to close out 2015! My only complaint...

"Great improvement in the buffet and overall atmosphere. Last year was not very good and we never returned till last Thanksgiving which was amazing. Yesterday we had buffet and not surprised the restaurant completely packed. Will come back regular and keep up the good work Renaissance Team!","5 из 5 кружков","F0A6CA406B147BB55FAFEB9A3F7FCDD0","Отзыв написан 19 декабря 2015"

"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times and always eat breakfast at BLD. I was just there for 5 days in early December and it was better than I remembered. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and the food offerings large and of excellent quality. You will not go wrong eating at BLD.","4 из 5 кружков","3EF93D4E9785473F660E84BD2592D27B","Отзыв написан 13 декабря 2015"

"Myself and 7 colleagues attended the Thanksgiving buffet dinner. Many of our party were not from the U.S. so this was their first Thanksgiving encounter. It was fantastic.

"We often stay at the Renaissance Hotel in Beijing, and so we frequently take our meals at the BLD -- breakfast, lunch and dinner. Unlike previous breakfasts visits when we have been met by a sullen greeter, this morning we were met with welcoming smiles! In fact, every employee we came into contact with could not have been more helpful,...

"We were at BLD for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We couldn't fault them this time on their food, presentation or service. A huge improvement from last time, when the Singapore Laksa was almost inedible. The menu has changed, and the quality and taste of the food has improved. Well done!","4 из 5 кружков","54B982B5BC222BBC9176BA71E54392F9","Отзыв написан 28 марта 2015"
"Wow, I stay at the Renaissance Capital in Beijing often and last time I was here I gave it a rave review for its service. The service is still great, but the BLD Restaurant was disappointing. I ordered the Singapore Laksa and it was so sweet and thick it should have been served as dessert. My husband had a great...

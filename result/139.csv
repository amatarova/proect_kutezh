"We had the breakfast buffet here and the selection was awesome. (Not sure of the price, as we got it included with rate.)

"The Sunday Brunch is indeed well done. The dining room and overall ambience is very elegant. Food is excellent, small serves and plenty of variety to meet the needs of all diners. Service was excellent with one exception. A staff member standing in front of the buffet totally ignored patrons and even when approached with a question (in English and...

"Weather it is for a summer BBQ in the garden with free flow of local and international beers or the brunch with free flow of Champagne it is the place to go. I have become a regular cause of the great service and variety. I have been with friends and also for business dinners and must say it is great....

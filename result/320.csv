"It's the Wandering Yank here. On a recent business trip, our hosts took us out to Bian Yi Fang. Great choice!!! We had 2 round tables in a private room, about 20 of us. Large lazy susans on the tables made it very easy to pass food around. We had Peking Duck, of course. Then maybe another dozen dishes -...

"We visited this on a family visit upon recommendation of a local expert. We dined upstairs. The food was overall good very typical and also traditional. The menu was good, family friendly seating. The floor was very informal though and it seemed they had mixed client dining with staff dining. Bathrooms could have been better it was full of cigarette...

"The restaurant is off the beaten, located inside an Indistinct commercial building but don't be fooled by appearances, the food is absolutely yum! A short (10m) taxi ride from Wangfujing (the main central avenue in Beijing), you'll enter a typical Chinese restaurant, frequented mainly by local foodies, which is the main difference between this less known resto and the overrated...

"We ate as a group of 12 on the top floor. The room lacked atmosphere, it just had 2 round tables and one small table where the chef carved the duck. There was a selection of dishes plus the duck that was served with pancakes, sauce, onions and cucumber. It wasn't quite as crispy as it is in UK so...

"Our driver Ping sifu suggested this place after a hectic Great Wall experience (Mr. Ping is our secret driver whom we only pass his number to the people we like. He is not for sale). It was near closing at 1:45 pm. Duck of course, and we got it hot on the tail of some cold beers and fruit juices....

"We had booked but arrived at the same time as a huge coach trip; we spent twenty minutes or so having a beer downstairs and were soon upstairs with the food. Huge quantities of duck and other dishes plus the ceremony of watching it get sliced. Couldn't quite bring myself to scoop out the brains but everything else was sampled...

"Since we were going that evening to see the Kung Fu show at the Red Theater this restaurant was recommended to us due to a couple of reasons. It was one of our guide's favorites where supposedly he comes with his wife. It is also one of the best Peking duck places in Beijing. A very short walking distance from...

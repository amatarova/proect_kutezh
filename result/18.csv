"Seem local and cool - no English speaking when we where here but point out the dishes in the menu works just as good. The food was rapidly prepared for us and came in when ready. Extremely tasty dumplings (all we had) and we eat 4 people incl a beer each for 25$ Liked everything about it","5 из 5 кружков","59C2AA0EA7EBB038D8DDD283E710ACB1","8 марта 2017"
"Surprisingly good food, even plain broccoli tasted excellent. The dumplings are however their speciality and you can get them with almost anything inside. The kids liked everything we ordered, if it was not too spicy.","5 из 5 кружков","61A6B7C7A054D9C63DD21AFFC4E1B6B6","3 марта 2017"
"This hole in the wall of a back alley is worth the adventure to find, especially if you like Americanized Chinese food. My friends and I agreed this was the best ""Chinese"" food we had over our 3 days in the city. We also had a chance happening of running into our friends we had lost contact with. Love this place, highly recommend. The walls full of patrons' names from around the globe is interesting too. I preferred the original dumplings, not fried.","5 из 5 кружков","D81AA224358580DB8ED57DA9C3136463","27 февраля 2017"
"High choice range of dumplings, both steamed and fried. One of the best dumpling restaurant chains in Beijing, especially if you want to have a quick lunch, as the service is fast and in most locations can speak english (at least in the one in Gulou and Sanlitun). I would personally recommend the steamed ones over the fried, as in some cases the oil is overused.
The noodles are also excellent, as they are hand made and surprisingly fresh.
The overall prices are cheap, and a very good value considering the high quality ingredients (around 26 RMB for 6 dumplings or for a bowl of noodles).","4 из 5 кружков","E9E2F8C94E1DA41C9C06E635AFF63FD1","20 февраля 2017"

"We got a dumpling sampler and the oil splash noodles (appropriately named, you've been warned!), and both were delicious! We're big dumpling lovers, and while everything was scrumptious, the noodles really stole the show. They were handmade in view, and they were so fresh and delicious and perfect. Mmm. Mouth is watering thinking about them. The restaurant is in a hutong (tight alley), so it'll be hard to get a cab to take you. You'll have to probably walk, though there are main roads nearby that you can have a cab take you to. We loved walking through the area on the way there--lots of fun shops. There is no bathroom inside--only a public bathroom out on the street which is really no fun in the winter, so know that. Also, definitely a fair amount of white tourists there, but some locals, too. Menus were in English and Chinese, so it was easy to order.","5 из 5 кружков","718B4C6A792BCFBEF0601D97AF4AF71A","Отзыв написан 13 января 2017"

"This little restaurant is situated in one hutong not far from the Gulou. You can easily find it there. I was looking for some place to enjoy Chinese dumplings and thanks to TripAdvisor, I found this one. But it is a really very-very good one. Though the place is small, but they have a wide variety of dumplings and different noodles and and meat, which they cook just opposite in front of you. I visited this cafe several times and do recommend it to everyone!","5 из 5 кружков","588F4C098FAA354BAFFA2586C9B4C98E","Отзыв написан 1 января 2017"
"Back in a Hutong alley, very small place. Only about 5 tables in there but there was only one other couple in the place. They have a large menu and you can order many different types of dumplings, I highly recommend getting a sampler with three different flavors (shrimp and egg were delicious, so were pork and spring onion). They provide you with fresh garlic and soy sauce as well but beware - the garlic is potent! You can watch them hand-make the dumplings from a window right by your table, makes for great photos. Overall a cheap and delicious meal. Highly recommend!","5 из 5 кружков","0C016E7185ECEF59EA594D306B97C06B","Отзыв написан 30 декабря 2016"
"The food here is good and the menu is extensive enough to please everyone. However, this place is really overpriced for what you get.

"We arrived to this place on a freezing December evening after navigating the hutongs (easy if you are using a gps). The dumplings were some of the best ever, freshly made in front of you and with endless fillings. You can also mix and match which is great if you want to try as many as possible. This place is very westerner friendly but the taste and atmosphere are all authentic!","5 из 5 кружков","A8D4A2B758E2BCE9DE2401803A7A102E","Отзыв написан 22 декабря 2016"
"Amazing little place in the Hutongs near the Drum and Bell Tower. A lovely quirky small place with notes on the walls from other travellers that have visited. I think I saw a Scottish Saltire on the wall haha! Quick service and you can see the dumplings being prepared. I had the fried dumplings and they were delicious - Mr Shi even offers dessert dumplings! The menu is extensive and is great value for money too. Menus are in Chinese and English. The food was amazing and the staff were wonderful. Definitely worth a visit. So tasty!","5 из 5 кружков","B401BF3E16292E220F6561B0CA3A366C","Отзыв написан 22 декабря 2016"

"I went without knowing anything about the hype of other reviews on Tripadvisor. It's a small restaurant in the Hutong with quick service and some really good food. If you are a Chinese food connoisseur it is probably far too westernized for your palate, but for me it was ideal as I was not feeling adventurous I'd done that all week) and wanted something a bit less challenging to my palate. It is clearly frequented by students, travellers and English speakers . If you are looking for an authentic Chinese experience go elsewhere. If you just want some good food, go here.","5 из 5 кружков","954D2526332106E6DD756FB1173294BF","Отзыв написан 19 декабря 2016"
"Dumplings were very good, with an English menu and choice of fried or boiled. The dessert ones were a new experience. Beer was a bit overpriced, probably because they get so many tourists in.

"So i have been to many of the mr shi dumplings restaurants and this one (Bao Chao) is my favorite.The Dumplings are the main reason to go but they have other classic Chinese food options as well. My favorite Dumplings are the fried variety and i would recommend the beef and coriander and the pork and shrimp. Its a little pricier than usual Chinese restaurants but the quality of the food never disappoints. Staff are very friendly and can understand the English from the menu. I love this place and will be going back for sure!","4 из 5 кружков","F757BF5B8799BC2A501548266A13DF45","Отзыв написан 7 декабря 2016"

Delicious dumplings! Worth the search, because it's in an alley. Far the best so far in Beijing! You have a lot of choice in fillings. You can also choose between fried or boiled. The best part of this all: they make it fresh! The menu is in English. What else do you want.

Tip: 1. try de banana chocolate fried dumplings. 2. Go with a group and share a lot of them.","5 из 5 кружков","ADC3B3E36FD0E8ED1E016AFDD164284E","Отзыв написан 30 ноября 2016"
"Searched high and low for this place and finally found it on google streetview but spent an hour going up and down the street looking for it, I finally called a friend who told me where it was and that they had recently had an issue with construction and had to move the door.

A pokie little place with great dumplings, I especially like their own chili oil that actually tastes of chili and not just oil.

Not fine dining by a long shot but great for your dumpling cravings.","5 из 5 кружков","1257C4E3E8FDD1CDBBD4DCD23264D1F9","Отзыв написан 29 ноября 2016"

"Close by our hotel we visited Mr Shi's on 3 occasions - but only had dumplings once.
We ordered a mix of boiled and baked and although tasty they weren't really for me.
On the other occasions we had more traditional (with a tourist twist) food which proved very good.
You can watch the cooks prepare the dumplings or noodles. If you order wine they might have to pop to the shop across the hutong to get another bottle - but at least they do.
Staff are good and will help guide you through the menu, advising on taste, spiciness etc.
The fact that we returned twice says a lot - and it was not because it was convenient - there were many restaurants nearby.","4 из 5 кружков","9CC6F27628B84093B797B3D5182AC2DB","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2016"
"We had 2 plates of dumplings (around 30 RMB for 15 pcs), choose if you want them boiled or fried (we preferred the former, but try both). You can mix- and match between different fillings, and you can basically have them filled with whatever you want (so it's easy to eat vegetarian) - which is great since many places in Beijing fill them with pork (which I don't eat).
The Gong Bao chicken was delicious and genuine too (although not spicy enough for me). Good prices too. The kids liked it very much too. A strong recommend!","5 из 5 кружков","6D7483D4E90465B43EA659476468CDB4","Отзыв написан 7 ноября 2016"
"I hadn't heard of this place but whilst wearily wandering around the hutangs, the food and drinks really hit the spot. In fact, during my stay I virtually ate dumplings every day and these were the tastiest, with the filling of beef and coriander as my favourite. Yes. It may be touristy, but so are many of the places in Beijing. We visited in November and we were the only tourists there. The rest of the customers were locals.
The juices were also pretty special","5 из 5 кружков","B085C5A97BB1F5D2120C85A70CC1377A","Отзыв написан 6 ноября 2016"
"They have a large variety of dumplings to choose from. You can have them either fried or boiled. We chose fried. I wouldn’t say they were the best dumplings I’ve ever had but it was still very tasty. We also ordered a delicious cucumber salad that had some nice spice to it.

I don't recommend fried dumplings; boiled dumplings are ok but you can find same quality every corner in China...

"This dumpling place has a very casual setting, but the food is delicious, plentiful, and well-priced. Lots of dumpling filling selections, including many vegetarian. I ordered too much, not realizing there would be 15 dumplings in an order. I got a noodle soup, as well, and it was much bigger than the photo in the menu. Delicious comfort food.","5 из 5 кружков","E2A03E193B6EB292B2161B1A1EB55316","Отзыв написан 21 октября 2016"
"It wasn't awful, but it's definitely a 2.5 stars rounded up really. I was pretty excited to try their dumplings given their high TA rating and was expecting a fun local spot. In reality it's more of a hostel dining room - Geared up to feel comfortable to people who would perhaps really rather be back in the west it walks a strange line between student bar and euro youth hostel. With sharpie scrawlings from people all over the walls.

Dumplings were fine. They're definitely more expensive than other dumplings and nothing particularly special - but the menu is in English and they have a whole range catering to less adventurous pallets.

Not a spot to travel large distances for - but a comfortable pit stop if you're feeling travel weary.","3 из 5 кружков","44123E5BDF19EBECBF09D95DFCBEEABD","Отзыв написан 18 октября 2016"
"We stopped by Mr. Shi's on the recommendation of TripAdvisor and it did not disappoint. After finding our way down a very narrow hutong (alley) we finally found a spot and we were ushered in to a table - we had a very large party and our tour guide had been kind enough to phone ahead for us.

We went for lunch and we ordered several of their dumpling ""sets"" - which include a selection of their best-selling dumplings both steamed and fried. They have a HUGE variety, and it is easy to get lost in the menu - fortunately the staff is actually good at recommending what to get for a group of our size.

While everything we ordered was great, the fried dumplings are definitely heads and shoulders above everything else - they really are the house special. Any of the dumplings with cheese proved to be a bit with our group (and I had never actually seen dumplings with cheese...). The dessert dumplings (also quite unique) were great - the ones with chocolate are pretty great.

You should be aware that they actually have two locations on the same street - one houses the kitchen and is a bit bigger and the other is like an overflow dining room. The smaller one does NOT have a restroom and you may be stuck using the public restroom next door. The other thing is that our guide and some locals described this restaurant as pricey - while you CAN get cheaper dumplings elsewhere, it is still cheap by American standards (expect to pay about 7-8 USD per person for a great meal) and it is very accessible for tourists.","5 из 5 кружков","6C4ABE3F366023B9A33F38220028FC3B","Отзыв написан 17 октября 2016"

"We were recommended this place by our hotel which was nearby when we asked about getting authentic dumplings. Granted it can be 'touristy' but there is a good mix of people here, we found tourists and locals when we went and loved the Hutong location and vibe. The food was superb, easy menus, helpful staff and reasonable prices, thoroughly recommended. It's very near South Luogu Lane and it's amazing bars, stores and markets, so another reason to visit. Thanks Mr Shi, one of our great memories of Beijing.","4 из 5 кружков","19395135978D249F822C6202A35DD15F","Отзыв написан 21 сентября 2016"

"So, I took my Chinese wife to this place when we were in Beijing because of the reviews I had read. I must say my wife thought it was the ""WORST"" dumplings she ever had! And I have to agree It was a huge disappointment because we made the special trip half way across the city just to go there! We even left most of it on the table and left! THANKFULLY (for my sake) there was a couple "" excellent"" dumpling houses just down the street. .....There are so, so many other places to go but you need to stay away from tourist reviews because they have ""no idea"" what great Chinese food really is!","1 из 5 кружков","4A2E6880F30605318854A1E3B1BF5331","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2016"

"Overpriced & overrated. I usually trust reviews on TripAdvisor, but this one was disappointing.

I got fried mutton, pork & cabbages, pork & corn dumplings (5 each for total of 55 yuan) with hot sour soup, and paid 70 yuan.

It just simply was not good. Maybe because I ordered fried ones? DRY. Meat was far from being mouth watering. It's like all juice from meat and vegetables got drained into oil when fried. Good dumplings should be crunchy crispy on the outside but juicy inside.

If you think they are good, you must be a foreigner. I am a foreigner and still thought they weren't good.

Workers seem friendly and nice though.
Yet I had to wait 30 min for dumplings to be served, and they charge for using chopsticks (seriously).

Not touristy, local place I sometimes get my lunch, 22 yuan for 10 dumplings (and let me tell you they are NOT the cheapest place). And they taste so much better.

Lastly and sadly my Chinese friends who were born and raised in Beijing said they've never even heard about this place = not good enough for locals.

A good experience but never coming back.","1 из 5 кружков","C80AAE865AE1EAB6F4A6EA8A8657679C","Отзыв написан 19 июля 2016"
"We went here with our family and tour group. We had dumplings (both steamed and baked) and the steamed were the best Beijing style I have ever had. My understanding is they make them a little differently in the south. We ordered probably 11 different dishes and all were good. We especially surprised at how good the egg plant was. I wish I could remember the names of all the dishes, but I cannot. It is a little more expensive than the smaller street vendor places, but the quality is worth it.","5 из 5 кружков","7AFE2ACB8A1DF2B9A5A8A15B30DBF522","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2016"

"What's good: - Good food with healthy options on the menu - Kids dishes - Good atmosphere in a nice place What's disappointing: - Poor service: several mistakes in our order, pretty slow and no proactivity - A bit pricey","3 из 5 кружков","2BE29F07C8507B05C7B9893006C60337","4 марта 2017"
"Not only did I have breakfast there through my 5-day stay, I also had several lunches there and two dinners. The restaurant had a good choice of tasty, healthy dishes, attractively plated and presented by friendly and discreet staff. Because it opens directly onto the spacious, soaring lobby, with an out-door terrace along the other side, there was always plenty...

"The cafe is in the lobby of the Opposite House north of Sanlitun Village. It serves decent coffee and can also recommend for a working session as internet connection is stable. However, prices are more on the higher side (15% service fee added to the bill). Still, do not leave without having tried the cheesecake. Till now, best in Beijing!","4 из 5 кружков","F30623FF386044F9E90775E336D8394B","Отзыв написан 22 февраля 2016"
"We came here several times on weekends for the brunch buffet. The options are not as vast as with other hotel brunches but remind more of a breakfast buffet. I especially like the smoked salmon and the cooked ham (the best ham I have eaten in China). There are also fresh smoothies with creative flavours. Service could improve, several times...

"I have only visited once for brunch, but will definitely be back to try other options! I enjoyed the omelette with toast and tea and thoroughly enjoyed it beginning to end. There was a slight delay getting a few condiments brought to the table, but the wait staff were very polite, and happy to be of service. I'm super excited...

"This is a great place to have brunch or lunch. I like the cafe ' s chilled and comfortable environment, naturally lit setting and open kitchen concept. This place is very popular amongst the foreigners and I've never been disappointed with the food; good quality and appetizing presentation. The staff are friendly and can speak English.","4 из 5 кружков","2457AF70F1B43CE6B8E3F6F4F86F6E02","Отзыв написан 19 ноября 2014"
"We were in Beijing for 3 days and one of the day we decided to go to this restaurant. Some local friends told us about this place. We ordered Lasagna that was great and smoked chicken with avocado sandwich that was too salted (the chef was in love) :) Overall great place but a little bit expensive.","4 из 5 кружков","46A5480B9CD56674B881567C4071DF98","Отзыв написан 8 сентября 2014"
"This was a Sunday light lunch stop after a morning's shopping and it was completely spot-hitting. Delicious sandwiches and soups....

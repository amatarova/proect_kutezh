"A colleague and I were spending a cold and wet day in Beijing, and having spent a few hours in The Forbidden City / Palace this was the perfect place to stop for a warming drink and sit-down. Pleasant atmosphere, very friendly staff with excellent English and lovely hot drinks. I would highly recommend!","5 из 5 кружков","E257D908CB98737E859E054A5BF6D0CB","Отзыв написан 20 ноября 2016"

"Defently rent a bike in Beijing... Is THE BEST WAY to explore and move through the city! Walking is too tiring, public transport too crowded, taxis are trapped at trafic jumps...

"Been living in Beijing for 4 years and this place was a great find - there are not many decent coffee places around this area! I was first struck how immaculate everything is, you can see from all the details how well the place is managed. Coffee is just perfect, and so were the waffles and salad we had. The...

"Bike rental in Beijing. It has a nice cafe, the bikes are in good condition and they even let us take the bikes a bit longer to go to the ATM. Their English is quite ok, so good place to rent your bikes.","5 из 5 кружков","D8FCCB07B59833FF0C7EE7400B14EEF8","Отзыв написан 9 апреля 2016"

"My wife's favorite in town for Dim Sum the weekend (for many years). All are served nicely, with excellent staff attention. So far we've never been disappointed, dim sum always done perfectly and tasty. Tried open areas and private rooms. <TIP> the open area Hotel side is cosier, quieter and brighter.","5 из 5 кружков","D941C4BB4023E00076D0C11EE2F15D0B","Отзыв написан 7 января 2017"
"Great Tim sum and best xiaolongbao I've had for a long time. The restaurant was able to reserve some dim sum for dinner even though they don't serve them at night. The service was great and the waitresses were attentive - recommended if you need some hongkong styled dim sum quick fix!","4 из 5 кружков","E3C0BC0515B3B0C2BF95BE4810ECA8A4","Отзыв написан 13 ноября 2016"
"We ate and we ate and we ate. The food is a tad oily but very good. The roast pork and char siew has been done so many times by so many restaurants but this one was exceptional. Another dish remembering was their soup of the day and also the lotus rice. They were very busy so have reservations -...

"Greeted by staff who speak nothing else but Chinese, Lei Garden was our worst experience in Beijing. Visitors to Lie Garden beware of your credit card as staff could swipe several times without telling you. It happened to us but what made it worse that the staff lied to us and ultimately admitted after 30 minutes. When reported the incident...

"Great Dim Sum and ideal for lunch (do book as it get's busy with local people) however almost nobody in the place is able to communicate in English but they do their best to help you. I had a reservation made through my hotel however it turned out to be useless as nobody at the reception of the restaurant understood...

"The restaurant itself is very nice, looks like it's split into two parts, both interiors quite elegant but informal. We had the dim sum here which was fantastic, the filo pastry was to die for as were the Wagyu beef dumplings, very attentive service and amazing value for money","4 из 5 кружков","11F01D42D8A5D320F27339DED4A8B0C9","Отзыв написан 30 июня 2015"
"I went to Lei Garden on a weekday at around 1 pm and was seated right away. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. I had tea and 4 different dim sum dishes, each dish cost about 30 RMB. I am a light eater and could have gotten away with 3 dishes. I wish I had tried this place...

"Lei Garden looks a bit dated at this stage. If you don't mind the service trying to sell you everything that is on the menu, and other goods to take home for Chinese New Year, then you are in for some solid dim sum. Perhaps not as good as Seventh Son and Huang Ting, this is still one of the...

"I am a dim sum fanatic. The 4 dishes I had were all the best ever. I had the amazing steamed pork buns, steamed shrimp dumplings, steamed mushrooms and vegetable dumplings and baked egg tarts for dessert. The service was quick and attentive as the restaurant was mostly empty at 1:30 on a Saturday. I will come back soon to...

"Unbelievable. That was so bad, we ordered chicken on a lotus leaf and all we got is chicken bones full of fat. They think their place is classy and trendy but they don't even respect their customers and they rush them to leave when the kitchen is closed. Seriously guys, run away, this is so bad.

"Upscale ambiance. Decor very pretty. Service very attentive but had difficulty understanding English. Prices high for quality and portion size. I grew up eating Dim Sum and found theirs average. To me, the steamed shrimp dumplings tasted like the ones I once bought in the frozen section of my local Chinese grocer. Lei Garden serves up more hype and fluff...

"First things first: the dim sum were superb, the vermicelli pork dish we shared was fantastically tasty and light, and the Baron de Rothschild Bordeaux was okay value for Beijing. All in, it was less than 1,000 Yuan - so very reasonable by international standards. But the service was patchy. The staff wanted to help but (unlike two other restaurants...

"They pride themselves to be among the best. They open their wine list with the Chateau Latours, the 1978 goes for around RMB 44,000 (that is about USD 7,200, perfect if you need to impress your date or business partner) and the food is actually quite good. The staff is attentive and the location and ambiente also quite ok. But...

"We went to this restaurant during our first night in beijing. We were quite tired because of the long trip so we chose it because it was close to the hotel. It's a quite big restaurant with a 80's atmosphere and big tables. It was a little bit hard to communicate with the waiters because they speak very little English....

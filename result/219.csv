"Great choice for discovering new and maybe uncommon cocktails (Ingredients such as rosemary, jasmine tea, etc. ). No worries, they have the classics as well. Excellent quality for a reasonable price. Great atmosphere, out and inside seats. Happy hour from Sunday to Thursday 6-8pm.","5 из 5 кружков","04881B67078493B30AE7CE7FDB7872EB","Отзыв написан 31 июля 2016"

"The cocktails at Mai are fabulous and they always come with free bites (and a fresh towel). It is a small place in Hutong close to the Drum tower. The decoration is simple but nice, the bar tenders are experts and also very nice to chat to. Highly recommended!","5 из 5 кружков","492646708F40FCEB64B00F301B178940","Отзыв написан 15 мая 2016"
"Great cocktails in an intimate backstreet bar set deep within the hutongs between Gulou and Andingmen. Everything we tried was tasty and the service was friendly with a relaxed vibe. Can be hard to spot the first time you visit and the service is a little slow, but still worth a visit at the start of an evening out.","5 из 5 кружков","F081E85B7CDEE785A0F6890FDB9F205C","Отзыв написан 24 апреля 2016"
"Fist time my friend took me to this bar a few years ago and I have been trying to find it ever since. It is a super small good feel atmosphere bar with amazing cocktails. I fell in love with the cocktail named qongqing spice. Charming bar also with some tables outside.","5 из 5 кружков","269FCAD9F3A7CF22275A6B0997202058","Отзыв написан 30 марта 2016"
"Hidden bar, spotted by 2 small red lanterns. They serve really good cocktails and yummy chips. I like the atmosphere except for the toilet, it's alike public toilet. Do not enter the toilet! Worth a visit for a nice chill night.","4 из 5 кружков","158EAFF75069A4A4D500DA356D8A875D","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2015"
"This bar is really cosy with great atmosphere... There are some outside tables and a few inside as well. We chose to sit at the bar. The best thing about this place? The cocktails! They are amazing!! I am not a big cocktail drinker but I ordered a Lost in Thailand which tasted incredible... It tasted like coconut but was...

"One of my favourite bars in Beijing. It is located in a quiet hutong near the Drum and Bell Towers and it's very easy to miss from the outside. If you find it, it has excellent and very creative cocktails and very friendly service. Do order the Ginger Smash. As a side note, they give you free snacks with your...

"We arrived here on a Monday night not expecting it to be so lively but were pleasantly surprised to see this place full. They had a 'buy 2 get 1 free' cocktail special going on. The menu was extensive and well organized. They had a section of fruity, not-so-strong but tasty options (Beijing Passion, Gin & Basil Smash were refreshing),...

"This is one of my favorite bars in Beijing. Tucked inside a very quiet stretch off North Luogo Hutong, it's easy to miss from the outside. Inside, the small outdoor patio is a great place to sample some inventive, delicious drinks or imported beers. Cocktails are a little expensive, but that's par for the course in this city.","5 из 5 кружков","A623ED2F898E5BD0551723AE76930C5B","Отзыв написан 21 марта 2015"
"located in a hutong in beiluogoxiang area, this cozy bar with friendly service is popular among locals and expats due to the creative skills of the bartenders that incorporate chinese dates, hawthorn apples, and figs into such staples as the manhattan, old fashioned, and whiskey sour. Hutongs are always my favorite places to lubricate in this great city (far moreso...

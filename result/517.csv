"Very disappointed by the service and the food. We asked to see the manager (Chinese who didn't speak one word of english)to open our bottle in exchange of corkage fee and response was rude.

"Tasty. But nothing to write home about. Their teapot cocktails are very charming and original. Being Canadian we went straight for the poutine! No cheese curds, but it was still pretty decent. Order an extra order of French fries to go with it, because there is what seems like a liter of gravy.","3 из 5 кружков","9AF671EAC413537F4F4092EE7E4A52BA","Отзыв написан 27 июля 2016"

"Eaten at Big Smoke 4 or 5 times. Each time had a great time. Food is very good. Beer is good based on my friend's assessment. (I'm a non drinker, so...) Nice relaxed atmosphere. Popular with the expats in Beijing especially the American expats. The burgers are among the best in the Sanlitun area of Beijing. Nice smoky flavor on...

"I have visited The Big Smoke a couple of times with groups of friends and both times have been a bit disappointed in the food. The restaurant/bar itself is very nice; sort of shabby-chic style with cocktails in jam jars and teapots. The menu looks very promising with loads of yummy dishes. Unfortunately when the food arrives it's simply not...

"Nothing to rave about. Its overcrowded. I don't mean that it was heaving with people. I mean that there are too many chairs and tables in too compact an area. I had Poutine which wasn't Poutine. I had a dry half chicken which wasn't half as good it should have been. The price would have been steep even if the...

"The Big Smoke is big on many things. I, in particular enjoy the Apple wood smoked pork and Beetroot salad with goats cheese, amongst so many other delicious choices. It boasts also with a big atmosphere. The soft lighting, warm welcoming feeling and bustle of patrons make this a great experience with friends and family. It also hosts a micro...

"Visited Big Smoke with friends and enjoyed a surprisingly enjoyable meal. It is slightly difficult to find the first time as their sign is actually inside the restaurant if you are looking to see the ""Big Smoke"" sign.

"I went with pretty high expectations of charcoal seared meat but was rather disappointed. The food was ok but you couldn't taste the meat through the flavour of gas BBQ and everything was very salty and oily. The atmosphere was a bit noisy and crowded too, and it was a bit overpriced.","2 из 5 кружков","C1B18A544F2C76073970DE1EFEE224ED","Отзыв написан 24 мая 2015"

"We celebrated a friend's birthday here at the weekend. Service is polite and efficient; the beer is great but the food is incredibly underwhelming.

"On a recent tour of China we wanted a change from Chinese food and found this place by accident. Nice atmosphere - we just missed happy hour.

"After 10 days of a 6 month work trip in China, I was after some good meat and tasty soul food. I found an old article on The Big Smoke on The Timeout website. I decided this was to be it.

"This is one of the favourites of the expat community in Beijing. Good selection of beers, and a pretty cool interior. The rest is forgettable. Horrible burgers that are mainly bun, and very little overcooked patty. Hardly any flavour to the meat and other garnishes. This is a place doing a lot of meat, but when you serve side-dishes such...

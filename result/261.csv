"We were the only English speaking visitors that evening. Nobody on staff spoke English - we had a great time! Our young waiter tried to talk us into ordering two huge fish; they actually brought them out, but we had to just limit ourselves to one, since we were already quite full.

"Really enjoyed the Sichuan at this restaurant! As westerners, we were given an English menu; however, I noticed some classic Sichuan dishes were not in that menu, or at least we couldn't find them. However, we just ordered them by name: La Zi Ji (chicken with peppers), Dan Dan noodles, Gan Bian Si Ji Dou (green beans), Ma Po Tofu,...

"First of all, note that I said ""Chengdu Cuisine"" and not ""Sichuan Cuisine"". There are two competing schools of Sichuan cuisine, and this is Chengdu, not the spicier, saltier and oilier Chongqing cuisine. If you prefer Chongqing, there are better places to go, and some of your favourites might be missing from the menu. Also be aware that the portions...

"What can I say, it's Sichuan office in Beijing's restaurant. The food is awesome. Maybe a little bit more expensive than some Sichuan places but definitely affordable and reasonable.

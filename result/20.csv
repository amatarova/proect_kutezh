"Small hiden restaurant in Beijing (you have to find your way across the Hutongs), we had diner on the terrace. You can't chose what you're eating, but it's better like that. Actually, the Dali Courtyard propose an unique menu. Many dishes are served, from less spicy to most spicy. Entire fish to eat with chopsticks... very tasty! One of my...

"There's no menu: the chef sees what is freshly available at the market and prepares this heavenly 7-course or something meal for you. The food is not just extremely delicious, it is also of incredible good value.","5 из 5 кружков","EE716E8EBBCA5B837F015ABDA6EDF741","Отзыв написан 7 февраля 2017"
"You pay a fixed amount (around 155RMB) and get what the chef decided to cook of superb Yunnan food. Arrive hungry as the dishes keeps coming and each is cooked to perfection. Service was very good. You need to reserve to make sure you get a table. I recommend that you do not go on a very cold time as...

"I have been going to Dali Courtyard since the week it first opened so many years ago. Although it has become busier and the prices have gone up a bit, it is still a lovely way to experience and enjoy dinner in a traditional hutong setting. The family-style set menu allows you to sample a wide variety of well-prepared Yunnan...

"We went for lunch and really didn't know what to expect but a Beijing friend recommended it. They have a pretty little courtyard that must be lovely in the warmer months. We ordered a bottle of Chilean merlot and then the food just started to arrive. There is no menu to speak of - you get whatever is fresh and...

"Although a bit difficult to find, the search for the Dali Courtyard will be rewarding. Tucked into a courtyard off of a busy street, the restaurant offers delicious food in a serene environment. The courtyard is covered in winter and open in the summer. For a meal prepared with pride, be sure to try the Dali Courtyard.","5 из 5 кружков","687E8BE60C2D86C06C90393DAC0C0ABA","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"
"Loved this cute restaurant. Set menu slightly pricey. I am vegetarian, so had a bit of an issue communicating this (get google translate), and even though my husband said he was non vegetarian, I think they missed out sending us a few dishes that we saw others eating. However, the many dishes we did get were delicious and fresh. Good...

"Pleasant courtyard dining. Limited tables - booking essential. Also as it is down an alley it would be best to get your hotel to book a taxi for you - not all drivers will want to go there as it is very packed with traffic at night. As there is a set menu it is alittle pit in the way...

"Same story as so many other reviewers: great food, no menu, nice ambience, reasonable prices. Be sure to make a reservation! A little more about the ""no menu"" part.

"This restaurant has a romantic courtyard setting. The food is a fixed price menu, so you eat four dishes and have no choice. The four dishes were tofu, mushrooms, chicken, and fish. They were all delicious. I was alone and there was SO MUCH food. I did my best, but couldn't finish it. The great food, plus a generous glass...

"A few minutes away from the buzzing Nanluoguxiang lies this nice, small courtyard that offers a set menu with local dishes. Quality and size of each dish was really good and allowed us to experience some traditional, but yet different from the ordinary, flavours. During our visit for dinner, we paid 150 Yuan (no drinks) for around 8 dishes.","4 из 5 кружков","5AC308844795120800753FE6206CEB27","Отзыв написан 15 сентября 2016"

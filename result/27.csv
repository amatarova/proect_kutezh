"We visited this restaurant at night. Sadly there was no place on the ground floor for the shows. We had dinner on the second floor. The setting was nice in a typical chinese setting with lantarns and a front as you see in the forbidden city. The food itself was mediocre to good. We had 3 sidedishes which they recommend...

"I was here for a work dinner and think I was probably the only vegetarian present. However I found enough veggie options to have a tasty meal, in interesting surroundings. Clearly the duck was a major option for the meat eaters. As well as the courtyard they have a range of private rooms so it was quite peaceful. I wasn't...

"Fabulous restaurant - delicious food. Located in an historic merchant's house in the hutong. Lovely outside courtyard. The street in winter is filled with red lanterns. The interior is beautifully decorated. Entertainment very stylish and discreet.

"Hua's is a well known Beijing restaurant and we went there twice during our stay in Beijing. Every dish was very good and the Beijing Duck and the Beijing star selection was both excellent. The floor show was very interesting and our Chinese daughter-in- law told us that the dancing and acrobatics were very authentic. I suspect Hua's is a...

"I once lived a block away from this restaurant, and I've been there dozens of times - never disappointed. I used to think it was a bit pricey, but in the past 5-6 years, as other restaurants have raised prices, Hua's is now more than reasonable. They specialize in 'Imperial Food', which basically means the best version of pretty much...

"We went there twice while we stayed in Beijing. Everything is delicious, the area is closed to city highlights and the staff is charming. There was a translator into English and he explained to us things related to the dishes.

"Enjoyed a lovely dinner here which also had some entertainment which whilst a bit touristy gave us a different perspective of Chinese culture. Food was enjoyable and good sized servings but like nearly all the food we ate in Beijing over a week, lacked a bit of the freshness we take for granted at home. Setting was really lovely in...

"To start with: I highly recommend Hua's restaurant. It is one of the most famous and acclaimed restaurants on not only Ghost street but in all of Beijing. We had a really good time there. So why a mere 3 star rating? Well compared to other establishments serving movie stars and royalties (like our Swedish king and queen) I just...

"I ordered their signature eggs benedict brunch dish and I just want to get it out of the way: the food was not as good as I expected it would be. I didn't read closely and so was surprised when the poached eggs actually came on top of croquettes instead of english muffins or toast. To be honest, that was...

"Been here a few times now as the food is very nice, especially for a weekend brunch session with friends. It is also opposite Chaoyang Park so it is nice to walk around afterwards. The service is terrible. Every time I have had a problem with incapable, untrained and rude staff. Be prepared for a long wait for someone to...

"Love the place, always bring friends when in Beijing, the menu is fantastic if you want the healthy and yummy foods. I highly recommend it, simple but hip atmosphere, music is basic and it doesn't blast your ear, but too popish :(. Give it a go.","5 из 5 кружков","BD32EDC36E778CA3A91D9B941572113C","Отзыв написан 24 апреля 2016"
"Have enjoyed 3 weekend brunches here. Given that it is inside a residential apartment building (ground floor) it is a bit difficult to find. It is not on the street, but inside the security gate directly opposite the park entrance. But once there, the menu is very diverse. More geared towards western palates and dishes including: French toast with bananas...

"I have been looking for a breakfast place like this for a while. Great choice on the menu and a bit unusual selection which makes you want to try all kind of different things. Egg Benedict is great, the Greek yogurts are a must try (add the Chia seeds). It gets very crowded after 11 but worth coming early. It...

"If you are looking for breakfast I would recommend this place in a heart beat. We had such a nice start to our day here (at 1 pm) There is a wide variety of breakfasts available from the healthy Greek yogurt and chia seeds to hearty hangover cures. The coffee was delicious and served in nice big mugs. Staff is...

"Enjoyed a brunch with friends at the Rug by Chaoyang park. Though the place was very busy on Sunday, the manager Katrina accommodated our big party. Definitely need to make reservations if want to come on Saturday / Sunday. Service was prompt and seamless. The food arrived shortly after being ordered. The menu is really creative and caters to various...

"We both had heard good things and wanted to give this a go. Service was good. Food ranged from good to average. The brunch stuff like eggs benedict they nailed, other things they had little mistakes that took things away from the meal like the clam chowder potatoes being a little burnt. I probably won't visit again.","3 из 5 кружков","512E95AE440813A18D6A034E5623DEE4","Отзыв написан 2 августа 2015"

"Some people complain that the restaurant is too pricey... But in general, organic restaurants are priced at a premium to cover higher food costs. Besides, the portions are very generous. So, great value for money. Loved that they dress salads sparingly (one should be able to taste the vegetables no?). I'm glad they were not tentative in finishing the warm...

"I had heard raves about this place, and decided to give it a shot. If you are someone familiar with American brunch culture, the menu offerings might not seem so exciting, though I can imagine it being a welcome spot for expats. I went with a prawn pasta, which was, at most, average, washed down with a delicious - but...

"I went for brunch , got one of their recommended skillets. It was two eggs over a bunch of vegetables and bacon. It was not even mediocre at best. Big price tag for something that's just blah. Maybe can fool the locals but bad tasting vegetables over eggs and some sauce that makes it look like garbage rather than a...

"Great restaurant for lunch serving a mix of Chinese and Western food. Good portions keenly priced. Dined with colleagues from our local office who rated it highly for brunch. Corn-fritters and prawns highly recommended. Service excellent. The only downside is that the food orders for each person came when they were ready rather than all at once.","5 из 5 кружков","95C1326851904BED3DBBB47AFC582467","Отзыв написан 28 апреля 2015"
"Unfortunately we only had time to pop into this cafe.

"Before I came, I read some reviews and some people said it was just average. My visit has completely convinced me that this is one of the brunch places I will keep coming back. Many choices of yoghurt - I picked wild berries and mango lassi - both are delicious. I ordered corn fritters and my friends ordered egg benedict....

"Coming across real organic restaurants is hard these days, especially in China. The Rug has committed to providing the tastiest organic dishes in Beijing. Not only are their western fusion dishes tasty and inventive, they also supply a list of where their vegetables and meats come from directly in the menu.

"It's a cafe, not a restaurant for Southern European standard. It's probably pricey for average locals and a hangout for expats and wealthy young locals. The two-person tables and chairs inside and outside are very cheap and uncomfortable while the big tables and the couch place are nice--we sat there. Food and drinks are pretty good for a cafe. So...

"We have eaten at this restaurant several times and each time we have been disappointed. The kitchen cannot handle a table of 6. The result of this was that the first person served at the table had long finished their meal before the last person at the table had received their food. After a long break, we gave the restaurant...

"Wow, the brunches in here are to die for! With the exception of the American style bacon, (as opposed to back bacon, which I've yet to find in China), the dishes in here could easily out-compete many a British breaky! The wide range means you'll be spending quite some (fun) time choosing what to have. I recommend the dessert pizza...

"While Quanjude is for visitors / tourists coming to Beijing from other China cities, and Dadong is for rich people / businessmen / tourists coming to Beijing from other countries, this Xiangmanlou is for true Beijing Roast Duck lovers. The quality is super, taste is true irresistible, and the expense is true cost effective. The most important, good service.","5 из 5 кружков","7AD4D616BC82C2C255F6D755EB00FD75","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"
"This restaurant located nearby our hotel and we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was quite full when we were there. The service was prompt and friendly. We ordered half of Peking duck, black pepper beef, egg plant and 2 beers. The Peking duck was delicious and we enjoyed it. On the other hand, the beef was too...

"A meal we will never forget. Not fancy, but authentic, delicious, and great service. It was a treat to watch cart after cart coming out from kitchen, duck carved and plated for each person. We didn't want to leave the ""Great Show"" and gastronomic delight.","5 из 5 кружков","BC786F39E200908DE7875953ECE70028","Отзыв написан 31 августа 2016"
"It does not look fancy from outside, but it is one of the best restaurants in Beijing in my humble opinion. My parents recommended the restaurant to me 16 years ago when I first came back to Beijing. Now they are living on the other side of the pond, but the restaurant is still a must-go for them every time...

"As being in Beijing for more than 8 years, I trust this restaurant. The price, the quality, were all so much better than some of the most famous restaurants in Beijing.

"The duck was good and as yours is ready you are asked to come and see it cut. The pancakes are divine and sauces excellent. This is authentic peking duck for sure...atmosphere a little lacking.","4 из 5 кружков","54DA775028DF6D4A73A2AA9C6BE0786A","Отзыв написан 1 июня 2015"
"Be sure to book early and reserve your roast duck so you don't have to wait! Great food, we thought we'd ordered too much but it was so tasty that it was almost all eaten in the end. The duck is definitely the main reason to go. The ambiance isn't anything special.","4 из 5 кружков","21648BC6E71A66871EC9463FBE448952","Отзыв написан 20 мая 2015"

"Your are in town and willing to have Beijing duck? Xiang Man Lou is a place to have it. And not just duck. All the famous dishes from Chineese cuisine are delicious in here. One and the only place for me to savor Gong boa ji ding. Love it!!!! The only problem with this place-it's crowded all the time so...

"You can find much more impressive looking places, but you're unlikely to find such good duck and at such a good price point as well. Duck and all the fixings, properly served - take your time, enjoy - and book so you don't spend a lot of time waiting or be disappointed, because this place is appropriately popular with Beijingers.","5 из 5 кружков","0ED7735840E5309CD259E37C865F369C","Отзыв написан 11 февраля 2014"
"by the unpromising exterior and the faded interior! I was taken by a Chinese friend who reasonably swears that the food is the equal of any in Beijing for its quality. It is very popular with locals and one needs to arrive early. Although the food is quintessentially Chinese there is a menu which illustrates all dishes. My host ordered...

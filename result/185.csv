"The competition for being the best burger place in Beijing, I understand, is pretty fierce. I haven't checked out many of the places that do burgers but I have to say that so far, this is the best I have had in Beijing. I'm not overly fussed by the iPad ordering, although it worked smoothly, but the staff are friendly...

"Known locally as LAD, this is a great,but now very busy, diner. Ideal for breakfast / brunch. Jumbo breakfast is a real feast, costs 65 RMB, coffee at 20RMB. Good choice , reasonable service , allow 45minutes, this is not fast food but is good value and good food!","5 из 5 кружков","37EF1F5C37A6F43C4BAF51585945763E","Отзыв написан 15 января 2017"
"Lily's is a great breakfast spot. I have been living in Beijing for over 2years now and they never disappoint. My friends and I gather here at lest once a month for Saturday breakfast. It reminds you of Denny's in the US.","5 из 5 кружков","DD7E79ECBDB4254BD94E59C0AA4268DF","Отзыв написан 31 октября 2016"
"I used to place orders delivery and I stopped because of some ingredients being spoiled! and also, girl that I ordered from on wechat deleted me to avoid the responsibility of replying to messages to take orders and their english is really bad and to avoid replying to the pictures of hair in food and spoiled ingredients on the tacos...

"This is a great breakfast place if you have a hankering for good a ole' western style breakfast. Selecting what you want to eat on an iPad in English takes a lot of the guess work out of the ordering process even though the staff speaks pretty good English. They offer eggs, french toast, pancakes, waffles and interesting omelette combinations....

"Excellent American style restaurant with a wide range of western dishes. Breakfast served all day, as well as burgers, pastas, sandwiches, and colourful fresh salads. Meal is an excellent price - about <U+00A3>20 for dinner for two people, including a drink each. Perfect if you are a westerner in Beijing missing home.","5 из 5 кружков","8BA9F16F59BCAF04E55E2993F940F252","Отзыв написан 26 августа 2016"
"On Sunday morning, my wife and I would like to have brunch outside. Lily's American Diner is listed on the top of my neighborhood restaurants. We decided to give it a try. To our surprise, the food is beyond our expectation. The food taste is really great, making us recall our years in the U.S. BTW, the location shown on...

"I am a regular home delivery customer of Lily's and I am always impressed by their knowledgeable and always friendly. I don't speak Chinese but never have any trouble ordering because they always have an English-speaking employee on hand that can take my order. The food always arrives very fast. They accept cash or card on delivery.","4 из 5 кружков","C3D55C452FF414789058F1DE7CC903C8","Отзыв написан 29 июля 2016"

"Regularly order Lilys home delivery service and it is very efficient. The staff on the phone know the menu thoroughly, are polite and the food always arrives within half an hour. Would definitely recommend Their Sanlitun location also has a lovely terrace, great for spring/summer brunches and drinks. The milkshakes are amazing!","4 из 5 кружков","F32DC937329D9858D876F37C2B1E4768","Отзыв написан 2 июня 2016"
"I've lived in Shuangjing for 4 years and I can honesty say this place does the best Western breakfast in Shuangjing, the staff speak enough ""restaurant"" English to suit your needs.The evening food is good but the breakfast is what I come for.

"Lily's American Diner compares favourably when held up against the general quality of Beijing's Western Food. Go there if you want solid comfort food, served promptly, at a fair price. + Points • It's pretty much always open. Only closes over Chinese New Year. Also, doesn't indulge prevalent Chinese notion that meals should be at set times. Open for Breakfast,...

"I have lived in Beijing for a year and a half and this is hands down my favorite place to be in the city! The wait staff is magnificent. They know me by name now and know my favorite dishes. The Greek salad, guacamole, grilled cheese, French toast, brownie with ice cream, fries and coselaw are to die for! Great...

"I dined here recently with my wife and 2 children. Between us we had 2 burgers and 1 pizza, and really enjoyed the food and experience. We dined at the Sanlitun branch, and ordering was easy through bilingual ipads, and with bilingual waiters. The food was well priced, delicious and there was a reasonable drinks list that was also well...

I ate Turkey, extra stuffing, no potatoes, enjoyed it with gravy and cranberry sauce. Definitely a meal that I would return for. Not only was it delicious, but they topped it off with Nanaimo...

The staff were the highlight however; manager Joe, who couldn't do enough to help us. He speaks very good English (hard to find in Beijing) and went out of his...

"This place is somewhere I eat EVERY TIME I am in Beijing. Joe, the manager, is amazing. They roast their Kenyan beans in the location and they have the best blueberry pancakes, hands down. Their other food is really great too, but the blueberry pancake breakfast is my fav. Go and eat here. I swear you're gonna love it.","5 из 5 кружков","76590E224208BE49BAB8AC7F3C4F8D9C","Отзыв написан 22 июля 2015"

"After visiting Southeast Asia and China, we had many many Chinese meals over a couple of weeks time. That was fine. By the time we were nearing the end of our trip, we were in Beijing, and I wish you could have seen us for those last two evenings looking for something to eat that was not Chinese! Very hard...

"My first night in Beijing led me to meet my colleagues in this restaurant which I found quiet; spacious and with excellent food. For a westerner like me with a palate that can't cope with most local food, this haven gave me the satisfaction to know I was eating well with food I can enjoy. I recommend the blue cheese...

"I like to order the food from Lily's a lot, but have been increasingly hesitant over the past several months. The woman generally in charge of taking orders at Shuangjing is incredibly impatient and rude. No mind towards customer service whatsoever.

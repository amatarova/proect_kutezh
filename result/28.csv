"To be fair with this review I must start by saying even though we are both foodies Duck is probably not our poultry of choice. Also we arrived at the restaurant with a few drinks under our belts.

"You must have Peking duck while you are in Beijing and this place is an excellent choice. It is located close to excellent shopping and it is usually busy with locals and tourists.

"We had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant with some Chinese business associates, so the ordering was easy. The Peking Duck is large, so best to come with a group of 4 or more people or plan on taking home leftovers. They bring the duck to the table and provide a providence of the duck - it is a...

"This is a very old and famous restaurant known for its duck. One of my friends recommended it to me to visit. The duck was very well done, moist and juicy. It was some of the best duck I've ever had. The chef comes out, slices it, and serves it. We had it served with mushu pancakes, which was delicious....

"I've been to several stores of Quanjude. They are definitely the most famous and one of the oldest chains for Peking duck but quality has gone downhill for years.

"This is arguably the most famous roast duck restaurant in China, and probably the oldest. It is huge, noisy, extremely busy and very professional. Value for the money is excellent and the food we tried was flawless. The duck was definitely one of the best we had and generously served. Crispy, well cooked and just fat enough.

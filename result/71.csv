"Only the best steaks here. Just went yesterday and while you will come away with a full belly and a probably a little drunk you will remember this as the best of the best.

"Prime rib was beautifully cooked and delicious. New York strip very tasty, could have had a bit more char for me but would definitely order again. Service good. Dessert was a let down - carrot cake flat and stodgy and not up to the usual Morton's standard. The rest of the meal was good though, would stick with fresh berries...

"Been there on an easy Thursday night. PlaCe not exactly crowded. Service is definitely on a higher level of courtesy, remains on a decent average regarding efficiency and rest. I fancied a Double porterhouse, just for me. No side dishes were included in the deal, and it is very strange considering the outrageous price. As i said waiters and managers...

"Booked Morton's via Dining Week for my anniversary, plus my husband is a steak lover. Overall, it's good location, good ambience, and good food (with big portions). I'd recommend this place for anyone who fancies American style steak for a change. For me, the portion's a bit too much to handle. And for the price we paid, I wish the...

"A mainstram US steakhouse: short menu, lots of red meat, fat knives, mainstream cocktails. No frills. The catch here: prices at Michelin star level. Their website is mute on prices so we went for dinner. Starters around $40. Steak between 90$ and $300 -- without a side, mash potatos for $18 extra. Bottle of San Pelligrino at $15. Standard wine...

"Happy Hour is a must if your're a Westerner in China. Shut your eyes and you will think you are in Chicago. Sadly, Morton's and all others can't get US beef into China yet, so you have to deal with Austrailian beef. Everything else is consistent with the Morton's experience. Can't beat the Cheese Cake with a glass of Grand...

"We attended this restaurant on our last night in Beijing. The atmosphere and service was excellent. However steak is very expensive in China with an average steak on the menu approx. $A200.00.

"Morton's is a full-on, high end steakhouse with a superior but pricey wine list. Definitely an expense account place and also for a dinner to impress clients.

"Having been to Mortons in the US - and longing for a good steak while visiting Beijing we chose to dine at Morton's. The steak was to die for and the side dishes nice as well.

"I've tried Morton's in Chicago, and loved it. This one is the only operation in Beijing. Still loved the steak. The environment and service is really high end, so is the price.

"Went to Morton's for dinner last night and we had high expectations. First warning sign was the ambience, or lack thereof. Brightly lit dining room with obtrusive Top-40 music piped in. The kind of music you might expect in a coffee shop at 10 am or your gym, not at a high-end restaurant at 8:00 p.m. If a restaurant insists...

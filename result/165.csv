"Select the [NOBU] Japanese Restaurant on the first floor of the JW Marriott Hotel. There is no kind of Izakaya crowded, more than a point of comfort and enjoyment. Here dishes can also be a single point of the package. Chef's intentions and careful, sophisticated enough to make people become regulars. Cod is very tender, sashimi is also very fresh....

"Have been to NOBU in San Diego in the States and have long been wanting to try the NOBU in Beijing. After a long day of work and wanted to pamper myself with a good sushi dinner.

"My first experience at NoBu was in London! This is not the same scene, it's very much localised! The food though top class with the specials on the Menu hitting the spot like any NoBu around the globe. People eat early in this town so don't expect the same vibe! Go for the food and service!","5 из 5 кружков","02040C872E5D520CAE86871D3062E09C","Отзыв написан 2 ноября 2016"
"While entertaining guest from Asia who were also visiting Beijing we had dinner and Nobu and it is recommended. The menu offers a wide variety of Asian based dishes which should appeal to many different people. The restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated and the staff does an excellent job of serving you in an not obtrusive way. It is...

Service was very attentive perhaps as I was only the few guests there on the night... however food was just O-K... Highlight would've been the toro with caviar however the...

"In the JW Marriott. The food is perfect Nobu. Believe the ratings $$$$$. I had a small Nobu Sashimi plate for lunch, with two beers - US$200. But those 14 bites were worth every penny.","5 из 5 кружков","DDA4BC56F8E2C7E4C0D495D53E667BAE","Отзыв написан 23 апреля 2016"
"An amazing experience i had with NOBU restaurant, very polite staff and had an amazing service, they all speak english which was very convenient. As for the food it was tasty and great i enjoyed it very much, we went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded. For the prices it was reasonable! And good for a 5 star restaurant....

"I had high expectations given this restaurant carried the Nobu brand. We ordered the 888 tasting menu for the full experience. Each dish was pleasant, but not mind blowing in either composition or quality of ingredients. The sushi course was what you would get in any decent sushi restaurant, and some of the sashimi was overpowered by lemon juice and...

"Can I say it's overpriced for its offering? Yes. Not because of the quality of the food, but the service. The pairing has to work right to elevate the taste. The service we received that day was on par with a local Pizza Hut. There were little to no mention of the course that was served. They look fancy, but...

"We have visited a number of the Nobu restaurants around the world and we were not disappointed by the one in Beijing. The staff are professional and friendly, the cocktails are amazing and the food is delicious. The only criticism we had was that it was very quiet so lacked a bit of atmosphere but overall I would highly recommend...

"Went to lunch at NOBU Beijing and was quite disappointed. I ordered one of the bento boxes, but the fish was so salty that I drank a gallon of water after. The miso soup tasted like instant miso pack + water. Definitely didn't expect a US$70 lunch to be this bad! Don't recommend... the restaurant was empty and probably only...

"We had a business dinner with a party of 8. The pros : excellent food, extremely fresh sashimi, imported oysters, excellent meat dishes The cons : service slow at times despite an empty room (only two other tables beside us). Wine list inaccurate and rather short for a restaurant of that category. Staff without any knowledge about wine.","4 из 5 кружков","FE26537BA24EBA1034DC51E163AE95CF","Отзыв написан 3 февраля 2015"
"We ate here a few times during our stay in the hotel and the service was great. The girls were really friendly and spoke very good English. The restaurant is not really like the Nobu in Los Angeles or Las Vegas but it was a perfectly good restaurant to have a nice meal in Beijing. You can say that it...

"I've tried a good amount of sushi in different locations all over the globe. I believe that besides excellent fish all that can set apart a restaurant or sushi chef besides garnish is unique sauces and preparations. Nobu's signature dishes were awesome. Loved the use of vinegar and other sauces that make the experience unique, different and very tasty. Strongly...

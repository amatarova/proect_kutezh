"My favorite Peking duck restaurant. Despite the very long waiting time (sometime up to an hour if no booking) Siji Minfu never disappointments. In addition, to their delicious ducks, the menu offers an abundance of great Chinese staple dish. Make sure to call to get a number/booking. Best for large groups!!!","4 из 5 кружков","AAA470A55E34F8EA10C96011C55D89A4","Отзыв написан 23 августа 2016"

"Well - it did take around 2 hours to get seated I think, but it was not really much of an issue. Good company, and sitting by the ovens watching the chefs prep the ducks really was unusual and pretty cool. When we did get seated, thankfully upstairs, as the outside temp of -20C was being felt downstairs somewhat, and...

"First meal when I arrived Beijing. As a girl who grew up in Beijing I really know what a great Beijing roast duck should taste like, but trust me this one is just average, or maybe is not the right time when I visit. The duck we had is not warm enough I assum it was not freshly cooked and...

"There are the other more fabled Peking Duck restaurants, which advertise more and priced accordingly. But those on local incomes favor SiJi Minfu. With white tablecloths and fine cutlery, this restaurant chain takes a back seat to no one in terms of presentation. Of course, the piece de resistance is their selection of roast duck sets. You can go to...

"The Peking Duck is sensational, carved at the table with great skill. Other dishes are top class. Very comfortable well appointed restaurant. Picture menus is a great help as friendly staff speak little English. Very convenient for underground and Swissotel. The restaurant is very popular so booking highly advisable. Relaxed atmosphere and very clean. This will be top of the...

"The service was good, duck was great. It's best to get a reservation or you will wait a while to be seated. I will admit the wine selection was very average.","5 из 5 кружков","07F4677B365BFDFC0164233154A60DD1","Отзыв написан 8 апреля 2015"

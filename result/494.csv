"Intimate deco and a solid menu with a high choice range. From spanish paella to an interesting choice of grilled beef. Good food quality and generous portions. The staff is well trained and can speak basic english. The wine list is also quite solid, although it misses a Spanish choice. Overall a good restaurant that is true to the high...

"I ate here twice while at the hotel. Once for lunch and once for dinner. I didn't try the buffet as the one night I ate there it was a hot pot buffet and I wasn't in the mood for that although it looked very good. I ate off the a la cart menu for lunch. All in all, pretty...

"If you are western then I would not recommend this restaurant - the cusine is very much catered to the Asian pallet (which is expected) however they do not have sufficient variation to cater to a western pallet. We had both Breakfast and Dinner there, the breakfast was better than the buffet dinner. It was too expensive for what it...

"After arriving we wanted to have the buffet (but since we were too late and the buffet was going to close we could only take an option from the a la carte menu - which was fine for us). Rather pricy (for the amount of food that we got). Nevertheless staff was friendly (but did not speak English well) but...

"Highly varied menu. Sometimes there is a buffet. I got the hainanese chicken rice which is poached chicken and rice. Was very good. Very few people were in the restaurant so the excellent staff was more attentive than would be expected.","4 из 5 кружков","1263E580DD4A5F410535813B7F4CEB78","Отзыв написан 7 ноября 2014"

"Dinner was a buffet. The selection and quality was decent but did not justify the cost (about $50 US per person). There are much better options for dinner in the area.","3 из 5 кружков","8445B72A21253CBF260EC24A1E6BC9F5","Отзыв написан 18 мая 2014"

"Food is ok but expensive. There are nicer food places outside the hotel. We found the food in the executive tower much better. Also do not ask for water. They bring you bottled water and just keep refilling your glasses. When we got our bill the water came to more then the food. Eventually we got them to reduce the...

"Tons of choices. They had breakast foods for every like & with every cuisine option. It's a bit pricey, but it's good way to fuel up for the day if you may not eat again until dinner, which sometimes is the case when I'm in Beijing just due to a busy agenda.","4 из 5 кружков","A95A1B365C439C766D490F143578FA6A","Отзыв написан 2 июля 2012"
"Service was non existent not due to wait staff numbers. We ordered a hamburger and chocolate cake it took 2 1/2 hrs. The food was so so but the mix ups on food missing waiters made the evening VERY frustrating and they add a 15% gratuity! ! For such an amazing hotel that type of restaurant is disappointing. Don't bother...

"Food was very bad and price quite high for Beijing. The chicken in charcoal was very weak and had a strange taste, the mashed potatoes as well and the Hilton Ceasar salad close to a joke. Bread is a bit ""plastified"" but not easy to find better around Beijing. The space is nice but I was looking for food not...

"A week ago, my husband and I went to this restaurant for a brunch based on the nice reviews read from this web site. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed about the food. The service, music performance, magic show, and the decor are great, but the food was not up to the level; for instance, sushi was not the right cut,...

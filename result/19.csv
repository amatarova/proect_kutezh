"Had dinner here with my grandmother, as it was her first day in Beijing and we wanted to have a western style dinner. Brasserie surely didn't disappoint. We were gracefully greeted by our waiter, who showed our way to our table. Overlooking the main road outside the Waldorf through a massive glass window, we instantly fell in love with the...

"The restaurant is beautiful, food was AMAZING but the most highlighted was the chef Benoit! Since we work in service industry, his warm and attentive service made us so comfortable. We really enjoyed every dish and conversation with him. One thing we could say, nobody served our champagne and needed to pour by ourselves and this was somehow disappointing. Thank...

"I eat in this restaurant consistently even if I am not staying at the hotel. The food is excellent and the staff recognise you and are very welcoming. Max, a young Spanish gentleman who is training in Beijing is very engaging as are the Chinese ladies who have been in the restaurant since I have been visiting. You otfen see...

"When eating at Brasserie 1893, you will certainly meet Benoit, the Chef, born in Southern France's Cannes. He arrives early the morning to prepare all the food and train the staff, and he is the last to leave late evening. In a very warm design and smooth lightning, a staff a young, smiley and friendly waiters bring to you the...

"We rarely dine in a hotel, but Brasserie1893 was as good a restaurant as one can find in Beijing. The atmosphere and service was terrific. The menu had a lot of variety and included raw and cooked seafood, fresh fish and lots of meat choices of grilled beef from New Zealand and Australia. I am a short ribs lover and...

"Coming from Sunny Southern California, I was rather excited to see the city of Beijing. Although I am of Chinese descent, I actually have only been to China once and I speak very little of Mandarin. Ironically, I speak more Spanish and French than Chinese. My girlfriend and I stayed at the Peninsula Hotel throughout our vacation and our room...

"As an expatriate from New York in Beijing, I've been having somewhat of a hard time finding an upscale restaurant that would match my dining experiences in NYC. However, it all came to rest after I took my visiting girlfriend to this restaurant. By itself, Brasserie 1893 blends well with the Waldorf Astoria Beijing while maintaining its own style. The...

"WA Beijing is a super property in general, and the contemporary feeling of the accommodation translates into the bar and also brasserie. Ambience for dinner and evening is pretty spot on, being visitors to Beijing, a more quiet location is preferred out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Food and service quality as you would expect for a...

"Well, this restaurant does the Waldorf Astoria credit! We had a lovely dinner, with attentive staff who looked after us well. The atmosphere and vibe of the place was fantastic, and the food was fab. Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves too. Would definitely go again. Would definitely recommend.","5 из 5 кружков","DCA0D8D4B417D9B901D00898EFD4827B","Отзыв написан 26 октября 2016"

"I took a dinner on my last night in Beijing with my wife in this restaurant and as you can expect from the Waldorf Astoria, this is rather a pricy place to eat but you are very well served and treated.","4 из 5 кружков","CC3E01059B68A56712B824EE3BCDC94C","Отзыв написан 29 августа 2016"
"Dining at Brasserie 1893 is a gastronomic delight. For many years, Beijing numbered but a handful of first-class eateries, but with the opening of the Waldorf Astoria Beijing lovers of fine dining have a new home. First of all, the restaurant and hotel are situated at a prime location, at the heart of the city centre, just off Wangfujing Street....

"Located in the famous Waldorf Astoria hotel, this fine dining experience takes you on a culinary journey led by their French chef. One MUST try their winning dish of Wagyu Beef wrapped in a cabbage leaf, their Beijing take on the Red Velvet cake but most of all the most incredible Chocolate Souffle I've ever eaten. If I was to...

"We found Brasserie 1893 to be better than several other highly rated restaurants we dined at while in Beijing. It is definitely not just another hotel restaurant, and is worth dining at even if you are not staying at the Waldorf-Astoria. The decor is quite lovely and the staff is superb. Our meals were beautifully prepared, tasty and had high...

"If you close you eyes this could be a restaurant in any major western city. The food is very good but, is also very expensive. Service is first class. We experienced the grilled lamb, which was properly cooked and flavorful, and the cod which was also delightful. If you staying at the hotel this is a very convenient option but,...

"The Brasserie 1893 is anything you can ask for. Employees are well trained in dealing with non-Chinese customers who don't know the language. Their English is by no means perfect, but it makes a huge difference the mere fact that you can communicate with them and the actually understand what you are saying. Hat's off to all the employees. For...

"Wonderful service, breakfast was a delight. A semi open kitchen lets you watch the chefs preparing food for the buffet. Service from teh servers is available as well. Very attentive and kind people comprise the staff. They go out of the way to please. Food is expensive but that is to be expected.","5 из 5 кружков","0E10F8EAC735680A8E23892854F43267","Отзыв написан 27 апреля 2016"

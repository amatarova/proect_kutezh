"Atmosphere bar is located on 79th floow of tallest building in Beijing. When the sky is clear and nice you will have the best view over Beijing. You dont have to make reservations in advance, but if you want to have seats by the window make sure to have one. It's a little bit pricy but totally worth it. They...

"It's one of the finest lounge bars in the city and of course, the best in terms of view. The panoramic 360 degree view one gets from the 88th floor of the tallest operational building in Beijing is just fabulous. On a clear day you'll have a mesmerizing vista. True to its Shangri-La reputation one gets some of the amazing...

"I've been to the bar and restaurant a few times to eat lunch and catch the city views during clear days, however was mostly underwhelmed by the tepid reception and general indifference to foreigners. Over the next few visits, it became clear that a large number of foreigners just visit to look at the views, but don't want to eat...

"We stayed at the Shangria La World Summit for 4 days in September and used the Bar quite a few times. Have to say not impressed, whilst you can't fault the views (hard to get wrong as its 80 floors up) the service was poor. Who are these people? You know when your in an expensive shop and you are...

"We came here in the evening for drinks and the view which is pretty spectacular. You can sit right up against the windows and at 80 floors up there's a lot to see - as long as the weather is fine. The drinks are a little pricey but what the heck, it's the 80 floors up that is the attraction....

"This is a good place to go for urban sightseeing weather permitting. The prices for drinks are reasonable, around 7-8 USD for a beer and 50-60 USD for a bottle of pretty good wine, if you consider that this in downtown Beijing, Shangri-La chain and 80th floor. Down by the street level you pay 20% but see 0%. The service...

"I stayed in China world summit hotel, so I can't miss my chance to the atmosphere bar. It's typical bar like any other ones in Beijing.

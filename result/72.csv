"This restaurant in the Ritz has excellent service and very good food. It also energy and vitality. The wait staff is constantly working to make your experience high quality.

"Today I had the good fortune to have lunch at Barolo - the in-house Italian restaurant of The Ritz-Carlton in Beijing. First let me warn you, there are TWO Ritz-Carlton hotels in Beijing - one to the west in the Financial district (which also has a wonderful Italian restaurant) and one in the CBD at China Central Park, Chaoyang district...

"We had dinner there by chance but it was certainly worth it. Did not have variety but the few plates it offers are well chosen from the chef. The waiters do not speak English but Stella Zheng, the assistant manager did a great job translating for us. Somehow expensive but it is situated in Ritz Carlton!","4 из 5 кружков","7752411183B7AB968CA98DC03B0F42CF","Отзыв написан 30 июля 2016"

"The only reason I'm giving it three stars is the attentive restaurant manager who actually made a point in asking for feedback on the food - and that deserved to be recognized. Other than that, the dining experience was mediocre at best. The beef carpaccio was ok (though it lacked seasoning) and the risotto was a bit too al dente...

"It was a very pleasant surprise to find a true Italian restaurant in our hotel in Beijing. On the second floor of the Beijing Ritz-Carlton was Barolo's. Their risotto was quite good and it was very interesting the way they served it. They brought out a cheese wheel with the middle carved out. Before serving it they placed the risotto...

"Extremely disappointing experience. This place is mediocre at best and extremely over priced. Given the location inside the Ritz and the title of 'Best Italian in Beijing', they need to seriously improve the service and food quality. The service was extremely slow and inattentive. The waitress repeatedly brought the wrong bottle of wine to the table and then kept reminding...

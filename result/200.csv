"We had been looking forward to eating at this top-rated restaurant, especially after several evenings of relentlessly oily and mysterious traditional fare. Unfortunately, the staff, though very friendly, didn't seem to be properly trained in Western meal service customs, which is really something that should be easy to fix. The pace of the meal was extremely quick, and considering that...

"We aren't normally ones to eat in our hotel restaurant. We normally like to get out and explore but didn't want to walk in the heat that night and couldn't face one more Chinese food dinner so opted for Italian. I'd recommend a reservation. We didn't have one but got there early enough. However didn't get a table with a...

"We used the private room to host a group of 12. The menu was set over lunch. I found the service average, the food was nothing to write home about. Deserts were the best. ..and must add the room decor was good...wine selection rather average....I guess I was expecting a much better Italian taste. Perhaps selecting a set menu over...

"One of the best restaurants that I have found in Beijing!! The Chinese chief is amazing.. He produces wonderful Italian food!! My husband loved our first visit so much we returned for a second visit.. Managed to get the same table and waitress ! The mushroom risotto with the fois gras is outstanding ! The molten chocolate desert is the...

"I wouldn't normally eat Italian in China, but sometimes, if you're not Chinese, you want a change from chopsticks. The food at Danieli's was good, but not super good -- pity there's not a rating between 'average' and 'very good' on Trip Advisor. Attention to detail was excellent, with good bread and olive oil, but the dishes we chose (cacciucco...

"Atmosphere is nice as 180 degree window on the second floor. The food is real Italian but not super wow comparing to the price Beijing charge >178 RMB for spaghetti and soup. But money is not the problem for someone in St Regis anyway. The problem is the staffs who are trained to serve but not professional. The Chinese young...

"If you travel in Beijing and thought you couldn’t throw a nice plate of pasta and hit a decent Italian place that delivers, think again. Chef Pietro at Danielis brings an authentic and warm-hearted slice of South. More than your usual pizza and pasta pit-stop, this tried and true full service restaurant and bar has a tongue-bending selection of antipasti,...

"The food at Danielis is just so wow, the flavors have remarkable depth and the Chef comes up with those fantastic ideas, like The Butcher’s Grill; there is a whole buffet of meats that you can chose: Prime Ribs, Lamb chops, homemade sausages (staff told me the chefs makes it himself). Last night I had the best Wagyu Prime Rib...

"I can't quite put my finger on it but something was just missing ever so slightly with Danieli's. Service was good, as was the food and the wine list was ample if a little bit on the uppish side price wise. Restaurants in hotels can sometimes suffer in terms of ambience and it may be that Danieli's suffers from it's...

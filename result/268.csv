"This is a terrific restaurant. The staff are very friendly and the restaurant has a great vibe. All the dishes were delightful but I particularly enjoyed the potato balls, chicken parcels and mint tofu. If I return to Beijing this will be the first restaurant I eat at.","4 из 5 кружков","3094416EC31E371DF18E0177636D995B","Отзыв написан 25 октября 2016"
"You can't beat this place for delicious food and an authentic experience. We loved the spicy okra, lemongrass chicken and tofu skins. We had to return for a second visit. Beautiful people, cozy space, spicy food and cold beer. Go when you are ready to get off the beaten path. It's in the heart of the hutong near the Bell...

"I like this place, the setting and the staff but it is what it is. Again, location is a bit tricky with those beautiful alleyway smells. The food is decent but without being too special. I'm pretty sure it's made with care but there are too many better options within the near vicinity.","3 из 5 кружков","7A7494841BCC7007C088FDF6B74800AD","Отзыв написан 20 октября 2014"
"After living for more than 2 and a half years in Beijing there are few places that still surpise me and bring new tastes. Hani Gejiu is a wonderful little restaurant, decorated with a lot of love.

"First off, this place is hard to find. The taxi could only get us as far as the drum tower and then we walked from there. The best advice I can give is to head north from the drum tower until you are between the drum and bell towers. Then head to the entrance of the bell tower. Go to...

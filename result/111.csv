"This restaurant offered excellent food with a low price. The place is very small, but there was not that many customers at the same time. We left with full stomachs. I recommend this place very warmly!","5 из 5 кружков","C15A656C608CAF57C62F22A68B0B2641","13 февраля 2017"
"Been to this restaurant twice during my trip in Beijing as I stayed in 161 Wangfujing Hotel which was just opposite of this restaurant. This restaurant offers a great variety of food with their menu book as thick as 1/2 size of mini size dictionary. The first time we visited, we ordered Peking Duck for CNY 128, Mapo Tofu CNY...

"Came here based on TA reviews for the Peking duck. I have had better, I have had worse. There are two options, one for <U+00A5>128 and the other for <U+00A5>148. Due to our inability to speak Cantonese, we couldn't figure out the difference and the staff didn't speak English so we opted for the Cadillac version. I think that version...

"Жили в отеле напротив несколько дней, исследовали много местных ресторанов. Этот - самый туристический. Наверное, можно попробовать объясниться по-английски (в соседних заведениях это проблематично). По ценам - чуть дороже соседей. По качеству еды - нормально. Порции большие. Порция супа - реально на 5-6 человек.","4 из 5 кружков","98FE5C9AF7A87D28630AAF42EAB66666","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"

"The 159 Hutong restaurant was down the street from our hotel (Red Wall Garden). We found it on our own the first night and we enjoyed the roast duck even though it is not a favorite dish for us. The duck appears to be a specialty of the house, so we went for it. We had to wait longer for...

"A great little restaurant that serves great food especially the roasted duck and many other dishes, highly recommended to all foreigners who wish to try out Chinese foods with varieties. Were there 2 days to try some of the foods from the menu and the dishes are simply delicious. If you are there don't missed this restaurant.","5 из 5 кружков","E473C42213373DCAC5F5EF7A2CDF7FA2","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2016"

"We had a disappointing dinner at this restaurant. Originally from Beijing, I wanted to showcase Beijing food to my colleague. We arrived late around 8pm. The staff there couldn't communicate with each other on whether there's seats available. We didn't order duck because it would take 20 min. We ordered the lamb instead which turned out to be terrible -...

"We ate here on our first night based on the hotels recommendation. We had jumping chicken, black bean beef and soy rice. Everything was cooked nicely and overall the portions were too big for us. The place is simple and frequented by locals and we couldn't fault it. The value for money was excellent.","4 из 5 кружков","7C3319D6607A8347A3B4C90381CE73A6","Отзыв написан 5 сентября 2016"
"Visiting this restaurant was one of our high points to our visit to Beijing. We obviously had the Beijing duck and it was fantastic. You don't get the full on duck experience like the specialist duck restaurants but it's a great introduction for anyone who just wants to sample the Beijing specialty. All our other dishes were excellent too. The...

"We had been in China over 10 days travelling around and the food had been a huge disappointment. So it was great to eat here last night. We will go back. The food is clearly cooked fresh to order.

"I was looking for a great place to have roast duck, and didn't imagine we would be so lucky to have one right across the road from 161 Hotel which we were staying. We had the Sichuan green beans, 3 cups of chicken, and the roast duck meal with green tea! The service and the flavor of the food, especially...

"Tried this restaurant because it was across the road from my hotel after having seen many people queuing to eat. Got in early before the queues and was not disappointed. Had a few items from the menu and did not have anything that I would not pick again. Will definitely go back here if I am in Beijing again","4 из 5 кружков","BB0DFF2785DB529C905853AE4CBF7AFC","Отзыв написан 14 мая 2016"
"Nice restaurant with a big book of choices and reasonably priced. Beside us only locals, so thats always a good sign. We had an early diner that day and got a seat right away. After we left people where standing in line. There is a nice coffee/beer/whiskey place opposite the restaurant for people watching.","4 из 5 кружков","C7E2A02FF7FF88793E6E0AA218294D70","Отзыв написан 13 мая 2016"
"Very easy to locate as just off major street and corner of Dongsi Station. English menu plus pictures helps. We loved the 3 cups chicken-deep fried boneless chicken with basil, red onion, bulbs of garlic. The cauliflower was our favourite-in light garlic, brown with a bit of spicy red pepper. We found the beef in pepper and onion pot a...

"Located on Lishi Hutong, easy to find. The restaurant is very clean with a modern but authentic interior. The menu choice is vast with pictures and English text but not well translated. The prices are cheap and the beer costs 12 RMB for a 500ml bottle. Most dishes cost between 10-30 RMB. The food quality was very good with big...

"We were staying opposite at 161 so this was very convenient. The thing I remember best is that we were offered forks to eat with, which was very welcome after several days of using chopsticks. The waitress was friendly and we were able to find something tasty and vegetarian to eat.","4 из 5 кружков","DADDE5E9C75DF7F74A5ED5D84FE93427","Отзыв написан 16 апреля 2016"
"This place was by far the best restaurant we are at in Beijing and was also the least expensive ($30 for 3 people with 5 dishes, beer, and tea). It's definitely a more local place and seems undiscovered by tourists but I'm sure won't be for long! Even though we were the only westerners in the restaurant, they had an...

"Staying at SiHe Courtyard Hutong next street this is a great place to eat out if you are tired of walking any further. In fact - no need to! Friendly staff guided us both times to the last free table for two. The huge menu book is an experience by itself to flip through Chinese dishes. Order came quick, very...

"My wife and I were looking for something different, turned right down an alley and found Hutong 159. Very busy with locals, lucky to get a seat. Ordered the roast pork on the bone, baby bockchoy and salad. Best meal in Beijing to date!!! Would have rated it a 5 if they offered wine and customers didn't smoke. Highly recommend.","4 из 5 кружков","58573273408C4D9BCE720BD35E35FF3F","Отзыв написан 9 марта 2016"
"For the price and the laughs, the was the best meal we had in Beijing. We ate early that night, which was good, because we were able to get a table without a res. Tables are tiny.

"Found this restaurant down an alley a street away from my hotel, and what a find! It's always tempting to look for a quieter place to eat, but it is definitely a better idea to eat where the locals are eating. I managed to get a table by myself pretty quickly, but the place was full and by the end...

"Staying at a small hotel further along the hutong, it was a pleasure to find this bustling but efficient restaurant. Despite some errors in translation ('Fried Enema') the menu is easy to negotiate and well illustrated. The food was delicious and I only wish I'd been in a group rather than solo so that I could have tried a wider...

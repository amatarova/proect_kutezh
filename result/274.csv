"If this best Korean restaurant in Beijing I hope this is the only one. Chicken meat for grill was still frozen and of poor quality. The vegetable grill had to thin slices at to high price. Korean bibimbap was ok but not special. In summary a heavy over valued restaurant.","1 из 5 кружков","CA7CE14AC7588D6566C5F9F6AB31D6F2","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"

While staying at the grand mercure, I crossed the street and walked down the alley, and turned right and found this awesome establishment that apparently everyone knows about me. It's healthy, clean, inexpensive, and serves delicious Korean food. Well worth the...

"It's a bit of a walk from the metro station. It advertises the food as being MSG-free, fresh, and organic. Basically, healthy eating. The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. Servers are nice.

"Came across this by chance it is out of the way and we were on our way to somewhere else. Possibly strange to eat Korean food in Beijing (but not all Chinese restaurants are good by any means).

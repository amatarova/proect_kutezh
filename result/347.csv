"My husband and I were looking for a reprieve from Chinese cuisine (while we love it - very repetitive for a vegetarian) and we found it at Dacappo Restaurant. Chef Diego visited our table and customized a vegetarian dish that was to die for. I had the bolognese. We went back a second time and it was just as good....

"We ate here over Beijing Restaurant week. The menu was therefore set but still allowed options for each course. Each dish was beautiful presented in good size portions. The mix and range of dishes was good, it allowed us to sample a nice cross section of the menu. Everything was really tasty and the service was good.","5 из 5 кружков","700F505166E80DA74BA9C268183EA1BB","Отзыв написан 15 марта 2016"
"'m not sure on if Marco Polo introduced China to pasta, or bright pasta to Italy...or if it's all one of those historical wonderments. I do know that DaCappo has the touch when it comes to bringing the best of Italy to central Beijing. Pasta, sauces, delightful. Wine list is superior and the staff is there but never bothersome.","4 из 5 кружков","1C0DC8C228B19A5C1C2A032C814B866C","Отзыв написан 25 февраля 2016"

"The interior made us hesitate slightly for a simple business lunch, but however we gave it a try and it turned out in a nice experience.

"We were aiming to go to another restaurant for genuine peking duck, but the one that was recommended was full so we came back to the hotel and decided to go to Daccapo instead. Good choice. The atmosphere was very intimate and the service was very good. The food was of a very high standard and reasonably priced for what...

"We successfully fought our jet lag by enjoying a real Italian dinner awaiting series of Chinese meals in the days to come. The Italian wine we took was excellent but expensive.

"We should have been warned by how empty the restaurant was, but we were craving something different, and Daccapo was close by and recommended by the concierge. We all had soup, and both the minestrone and asparagus soup were served cold and lacked flavour. Then we had pasta, where portions were skimpy and flavour was mediocre. Prices, on the other...

"Went here with local friends for dinner. Food was fairly good (though not top), with good ingredients and clearly recognizable as Italian. Portions were a bit small given the prices. Ambience of the restaurant is fine, except that it has absolutely no windows, which makes for a somewhat claustrophobic feeling. Staff were attentive and friendly.","4 из 5 кружков","2659D828A397493FA74481B8C06E0234","Отзыв написан 29 апреля 2014"

"The Daccapo is placed in the Hotel Regent close to the Wangfujing street in peking. The interior and the service is excellent like the hotel. The food is really italian (italian head cook chief) and everybody talk english. The price is not cheap, but if you prefer an excellent restaurant, what could you expect... Thanks Daccapo for a great dinner...

"The restaurant is inside the regency hotel in a very elegant location! I came with a client for dinner and it was really great. Authentic italian food, first class ingredients very well prepared. The service is good, very formal. Menu is ok, very good selection. Prices are a bit high but high quality must be paid. Suggested to evryone.","4 из 5 кружков","1C65F9DC9D5FA479DB55C1FCACC09118","Отзыв написан 29 сентября 2013"

"The staff is helpful in providing information of different dishes; and they helped me find out vegetarian dishes. There are 2 veg dishes [no meat, no fish] available in this restaurant. Bread and olive oil is served along with main course. There are different tables for two, four or ten to suit all; with candle light in the middle.","5 из 5 кружков","9A5922437AE428F05068A52946AD2D14","Отзыв написан 4 июля 2013"
"Having eaten at Duck de Chine 3 nights in a row, and after 7 nights of Chinese cuisine in Hong Kong and Beijing, we wanted Western food for a change. Biggest mistake of our two week trip. Food was expensive, ortions small, and frankly not good. As an Italian American from New York and Boston, I know Italian food. And...

"Fresh in from London we were feeling pretty tired so decided to eat close To our hotel. On the face of it Daccapo would seem to be quite expensive but actually the seemingly authentic Sicilian dishes we tried were worth every penny. The service was excellent and my only criticism would be that on the day we ate at the...

"Wonderful decor and service, but the food was quite painfully average. I say painful, because of its price. I had the tagliolini, and it arrived before me looking and tasting like chinese noodles in ketchup. I might just never visit again. Service was good though. They had a true blue Italian maitre'd to make customers feel premium. I was amazed,...

"Service was really really good, food really tasty, but it is quite expensive, 140<U+00A5> for carbonara pasta (17€-20$) it is way too much. Still it is located in the Regent Hotel, very luxury place and it is a nice restaurant. I would still recommend.","4 из 5 кружков","820D068BCEEF5D20B7C9AA2883376008","Отзыв написан 31 октября 2012"
"Went to Daccapo the other day for lunch. Beautiful deco with a warm feel to it. We asked the chef to create an individual 4-course menu. Wow, and I mean wow. The food blew us away. Flavors, textures and presentation were spot on. Of all places I have tried, Daccapo serves THE best Italian cuisine in Beijing. Service was attentive...

"We found this lovely little restaurant which was right next door to our hotel and is located in the Regency hotel. It was a nice change from the local fair.

"My eggplant parmigiana appetiser and Oslo bucolic were very good. As a cook, however, I thought the food needed more salt, which you must ask for as it is not on the table. Also, unlike nearly all Italian restaurants I've been (and I've spent more than 8 weeks in northern Italy in the past 3 years, no additional Parmesan was...

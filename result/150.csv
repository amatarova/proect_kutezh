"Ресторанчик маленький, совершенно не представительный и обшарпанный. Но если вы пришли не за видами, а за едой, то он вас не разочарует. Прекрасные пельмени, большой выбор, супы, отличный зеленый чай. Средние и я бы даже сказал низкие цены для центра Пекина. Цена за порцию из 10 пельменей 28-30 юаней. Зеленый чай 16-18 юаней, пуэр порядка 30. Я с удовольствием зайду...

"Right across the road from our hotel, about 10 minute walk from Tiananmen square. We were greeted with smiles and hellos as soon as we entered. The menu is in both Mandarin and English. We ordered 5 sets of dumplings but they assured us that this would be too much as each set contains 10 dumplings. We ended up getting...

"The attitude toward dumplings in this place is best summarized by a line on a wall poster inside - 'dumplings are considered to be most delicious food in Beijing'. They're not wrong and the dumplings here were fantastic. We had pork & water chestnut (our fave), pork & chives and beef & fennel, but there was a wide variety (~50)...

"They offer many types of dumplings and my family sampled several. The dumplings were just okay. The waiter was extremely friendly and didn't speak English but their menu is in English so you can point to the dishes you want to order. We dined on a Sunday evening (around 8 pm) and the restaurant was nearly empty, no waiting.","3 из 5 кружков","5F2F0D341454953A08A0A4F2F5A571B9","Отзыв написан 11 июля 2016"

"A wide spectrum of dumpling fillings, some of which were quite novelty. However, because the lady behind the open kitchen makes the dumplings only after your order them, it can take a while until you get your orders. 10 dumplings per order - we had three plates between the three of us. Decor and cleanliness leaves much room for improvement,...

A plate of 10 dumplings ranges in price from 18-48rmb, and about 2-3 plates per guest should be enough for a good dinner. Large bottle of beer was 15rmb.

"This tiny place is terrific. The food is wonderful and clever with a real sense of home cooking. We swapped bites from plates and each and every item from beef and fish to the incredible vegetables were great. We also tried some of the herb wine which was also delightful and distinctive. They speak English and they are both friendly and helpful when it comes to explaining the menu. I will return in a heartbeat.","5 из 5 кружков","6E879610EABA2D4318BB49F318249E9A","5 марта 2017"
"When we went, it super crowded with Chinese people, which is always a good sign as it means the food is authentic and somewhat affordable. The waitress who helped us spoke excellent English, though she did keep trying to steer us toward the more expensive dishes. The food and atmosphere are wonderful, and I especially recommend the house-made rice wine.","4 из 5 кружков","9E7BB78EEAF738197A9F1C22399F5F7B","Отзыв написан 4 февраля 2017"
"Came across this place in my own and decided to give it a try. The place was quite full so that was a good sign.
Extensive menu, english speaking waiter and top notch traditional Chinese food. Price can vary from plate to plate, but the overall value is good, as the food tastes fresh.","5 из 5 кружков","E9E2F8C94E1DA41C9C06E635AFF63FD1","Отзыв написан 4 февраля 2017"

Good place to relax and have a break while walking in the busy hutongs :-)","5 из 5 кружков","931BAC611A54059F47A6231738F98C38","Отзыв написан 30 января 2017"

"I have already read of ""Grandma Creative Kitchen"" when i accidentaly found it, so I decided to try it.
First it was a little difficult, because the waitress that braught me the menu only spoke Chinese (The menu itself is a piece of art, and it is also in English). But she came back with another waitress that spoke excellent English.
I tried her recommedations: Grandma Fired Secret Recipe Fish, Spring Water Stew Beef and flavored Rice Wine. Granted, it may seem a little bit too mutch for one person, but after I finished there was not enough left for a doggy bag. The food was really really excellent.
The ambience is also fitting to the name: You sit at some old Kitchentabels, around you a collection of potted plants and knick-knack. I was really comfortable there.

Conclusion: It does not look like much from the outside, since it is located in a side alley of the hutong. So even if you have to look hard for it, don't give up. The food makes up for that a thousandfold. Also by eating there you are supporting a good cause. Grandma Creative Kitchen is a project for the elderly and students. I will go there again and again and again (actually i will go there today and I cannot wait.).","5 из 5 кружков","C99AFFE6A44FA146B6730F64A455BC65","Отзыв написан 27 ноября 2016"
"Nice small location in the Hutongs. I tried different sake which was really good. The dishes were good too. Same ingredients as other Chinese restaurants are using but different flavour. Modern and delicious. A bit pricey but worth to try.","4 из 5 кружков","04881B67078493B30AE7CE7FDB7872EB","Отзыв написан 25 ноября 2016"
"Only slightly hidden in the hutong, Grandma's creative kitchen offers bountiful food and a unique service from a group of grandmothers - who will all crowd over your menu to argue over recommendations","5 из 5 кружков","ED2B87A0D5E80B448E153A9E9331152C","Отзыв написан 21 ноября 2016"
"The food is just as nice as the place. The grandmas are super nice and good at recommending dishes. As I was dining by myself she recommended the meal set. I asked to change the meal set without any problems. (Because I wanted to try the duck instead of chicken)
Would definitely come again.","5 из 5 кружков","11582FE8B7B3512B3F95D158789828D9","Отзыв написан 12 ноября 2016"
"Wow this place was really fantastic! Its kind of tucked away in a hutong but there are signs outside so its not hard to find. Once inside its a very nicely decorated space with a cozy vibe. The menu is actually super cool because its hand drawn and each page has a ton of colors and great artwork.

The food was really delicious and you can tell they use really high quality and fresh ingredients. Spice level wasnt super high but it had a kick. I got the beef (75 RMB) and the immortal vegetables (35 RMB) along with some of the house made rice wine. Everything was absolutely fantastic! The rice wine was really smooth and they have a bunch of different types to choose from.

One of the best meals Ive had in my 25 days in China! Will be back again soon","5 из 5 кружков","B3BDDE345AFF7A1FE590B14D986A41A4","Отзыв написан 8 ноября 2016"

"We picked this restaurant based on Trip advisor reviews. They are in a hutong (lane) and is not easy to locate. We found that they had extremely well drawn artwork on their menu. The English speaking young lady is too aggressive and did not want us to read about what goes into the dishes but insisted we order first from the list of dishes. We ordered fish and a couple of other dishes. They all seemed to have same or similar tastes. We certainly will not recommend this place for the quality of food. If you are keen to take pictures of some interesting illustrations on their menu, it may be well worth a visit.","2 из 5 кружков","178F966BAA7AD231D4FD19601B7D032A","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"
"My travel style is to wonder to small alleys and avoid the tracks of the tour groups. This chance discovery is a hidden gem.
Friendly English speaking staff ( some English) a varied menu in English and a large selection of cooked to order meals.
I was resisting the hyped Duck places so was very pleased to get a stewed duck leg in grandmas secret spice blend. Delicious.
Well worth seeking out.","5 из 5 кружков","798611B8736E644B02AAB6551002AD56","Отзыв написан 27 октября 2016"

"Cookies and comfort food are standard at grandma's house. But the real draw point for this grandma is the rice wine. We had the original and clove flavor and the flavor was to die for!

"WOW! My husband and we're just walking down the alley when we were lured in by the smell! We were greeted with a warm smile that felt like an embrace and handed the menu (which in itself deserves a review)! I ordered the Charcoal Roasted Duck Steak (Wild Black Tea) and Grandma's Plum Syrup, two things I've never tried. It's a shame that they were both AMAZING and everything after will have a hard time living up to Grandma's standards! Without a doubt we will come back! It looks like a popular spot for the locals as well.","5 из 5 кружков","22ABFC2C9996F6EA186E2F99DEA36E3B","Отзыв написан 20 августа 2016"
"This place is so great, so glad we found it. Tucked away in a backstreet in the 'Hutongs', feels like you're having dinner in someone's house. Great relaxed atmosphere. Don't be afraid of the streets, even if they are a little dark.

Staff are very friendly and chatty, happy to recommend dishes for you.

Food is amazing, packed with flavour and the portions are a really good size. The menu isn't huge but that's a good thing. Menu is also in English and Mandarin which is very helpful.

Completely loved our meal, and would recommend to anyone who wants authentic food at a reasonable price.","5 из 5 кружков","1B1B7E57CCE30C849E1729298B2F2B48","Отзыв написан 18 августа 2016"

The food was great, we enjoyed all the specialities they recommended.
Our 12 year old son who isn't fond of vegetables said that was the best vegetables ever and licked the plate!!
The decoration is cosy.
You really should go and try this delicious food. The price are 1/2 the price of regular Chinese restaurant for tourist.","5 из 5 кружков","06A0B03B8BCE79CADF0F5244988521A0","Отзыв написан 15 августа 2016"

"Nice restaurant with traditional delicious Chinese food set in the hutongs (alleys) of Beijing. Owner is very nice and greets you with a smile. I recommend that you try the rice flower wine. It's nothing like traditional wine, but is instead made on-site with local flowers and other natural ingredients. Can be served warm or cold. It's surprisingly yummy when warmed. The heat seems to bring out the flavors.","5 из 5 кружков","B8D710415116B5F95319820A16007DE8","Отзыв написан 8 августа 2016"
"Great food, friendly and interesting interior - all at a good price - served with a smile.
We stumbled upon this lovely little restaurant whilst walking through the very interesting Houtons in Beijing.
The restaurant eves some very authentic, home cooked style food. The menu is not huge, which I like as it means each dish tends to be special.
This was the case for the duck dishes which are their specialty.
It's also a great concept as the kitchen operates like a social enterprise helping Young people to gain experience in the food business and it donates to the local elderly.
All in all a recommended visit.","4 из 5 кружков","6EA2BAB436DE3A09A4D658BBC3B4EFD7","Отзыв написан 8 августа 2016"

"I live in Beijing fro almost 4 years and when u go to a restaurant, most of the times waiters don't even look at you or smile. We do know their salary is quite low, so, if i was they, maybe I wont smile at all either.

Grandma is different. They have two nice restaurants by the Nanluoguxiang are, in the heart of Beijing. Their food is just amazing, and very reasonable priced. Un can there for less than 10 euros.

The stuff is Great, and also the decoration. This is the new hidden gem in the huting culture. And they do speak some english, so, it's really convenient for the tourist, despite the food is 100%chinese style. Definetly, one of the friendliest places to have a meal in Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","F8BEE93BB29B73B5D015389E37FD542F","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2016"

"Well we stumbled onto this little gem by chance whilst walking around the Hutong. Although they didn't speak much English we were fortunate in having our daughter speak some Mandarin which helped a lot. However they were always very smiley and helpful. The roasted chicken and meatballs were excellent as was the seven mushroom dish. However the pickled turnip skins were a bit too spicey for our taste. Overall however atmosphere was cosy and quaint and service was quick also. So excellent experience all in all.","5 из 5 кружков","3037EF8EA2F632D8F758C18426D5FAD0","Отзыв написан 12 июля 2016"

"I saw the reviews on trip advisor and decided to give this restaurant a go. It was relatively easy to find with Google maps. Friendly welcome by the waitress.

I had the duck soup as a starter. It was very mild and lacked any body. However, my main was a charcoaled chicken steak with some rice. It was delicious. I liked the decor of the restaurant and would go again. My total bill with a soft drink was 58 yuan. I also liked the ethos of the restaurant helping people in need.

If you found the review useful I always appreciate a helpful vote.","4 из 5 кружков","8F2837A7D9456A82061BF18D8217B5FE","Отзыв написан 18 июня 2016"

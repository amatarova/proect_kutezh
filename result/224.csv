"this was our first accidental find after checking into the Grand Millenium hotel just next door. We were hungry and chose this place judging from the ambience outside the the menu, we were also the first guests as soon as it opened at 11am. A good choice as by 11.30am lunch hour the office crowded started streaming in and became...

"All food in the menu, have the new and old kind of Chinese food cooking style. They use also green tea in many of their menu. I order fried fish with Green tea and Coconut chicken soup. Using tea as the ingredient in cooking for Chinese people is not new idea, so you need to go and find out yourself,...

"If you want to come you're probably going to have to book-the place is always packed even though it's incredibly large inside. The decor is a bit dark and it sometimes seems like no one is acknowledging you but they try their best with the amount of people they need to serve and tables to get through. Tried a lot...

I was advised to go after 7.30pm as the queues can be substantial. I arrived at 7.40pm, was given a ticket and asked to come back in 10 minutes....

"The Green Tea restaurant is very popular (Long waiting queues) and it's no wonder. There are dozens of dishes you can select from, and the prices are very reasonable. Main highlight for me was the bread loaf with the ice cream in the middle :D","5 из 5 кружков","E449F37F9B9EDD5F321E32F8D1F6E26C","Отзыв написан 27 марта 2015"
"Went to the one in Shenzhen. Amazingly good. Delicious and value for money. Visited in a group of 3, and ordered more than 10 items that tasted brilliant. Love particularly the Potato dish. The sauce was unlike anything I have eaten before. Checked the newsletter and noted that GreenTea has many branches spanned across China.","5 из 5 кружков","0919C9A275DEBF5A5E23B9DDDB256306","Отзыв написан 11 февраля 2015"

"I will still mark this as one of the best restaurants I have ever been too despite waiting for 1 hour to get in, the only way to describe our eating was gorging ourselves on the flavours. South Beauty and Da Dong used to be the top of my list but now Green Tea will be. I don't know which...

"The pho and appetizers here are fantastic. Their ban mi sandwiches are also really hard to pass up...coming here I take almost 20 minutes trying to make up my mind on what to order because there is too much goodness to commit. They have a full bar with an expansive selection of booze to chose from, but I also highly...

"What an amazing place. First off, the pace is cool, with a relaxed and friendly vibe as soon as you walk in. They have a great selection of beers on Tap, including the local JingA beers, which they are rightly passionate about. Then the food. My goodness the food. We had the curry and the crepe, and they were both...

"This place was full of Westerners, which was strange after having worked with Chinese for so long. A lot of fun, lots of English being spoken, and really nice food to boot. The quality of the food was almost too good for the casual atmosphere in this place. Hmmmm... Rereading my review it's not coming off as enthusiastic as I...

"We came here on a Sunday night, hungry for some vietnamese food. We had just the night before experienced a disaster of a meal at le little saigon (just around the corner) and desperately needed a vietnamese fix. The menu here is a little interesting, but they carry two local craft brewery's beers (Slow Boat and JingA) which makes for...

"We came on a Sunday to check out the farmers' market they host on site, which is very small but features some great products. Brunch was fantastic. We tried all three of their delicious breakfast tacos; each was nearly large enough to constitute an entire meal. The Belgian waffles are decadent, and also gluten free (they don't mention this fact...

"Finally a place that serves legit pho in China! I'll get to that in just a bit. We visited 4Corners twice last weekend; first for dinner/drinks and the next day again for a late lunch. That particular night the place was packed because there was a live band playing - pop song covers with a swing twist; pretty interesting! -...

"We went here for cocktails followed by dinner after visiting the nearby Bell & Drum Tower. We were surprised to find so few reviews for this place. The cocktails & beer were fantastic I particularly enjoyed the Pumpkin Ale but watch out its 10% alcohol! The selection of spring rolls is great we had the shrimp/pork & the summer beef...

"This is a great hutongs bar. It has a great atmosphere and is lively at night or quaint during the day. The food is really good. I've had pizza, lamb and spring rolls here and they have all been excellent. They often have live music at the back too which is always fund a draws in a good crowd..","5 из 5 кружков","0227E1D288086F695A640056E3650C57","Отзыв написан 16 декабря 2014"
"Trying to find this restaurant was a challenge and then the food was a pleasant surprise. After 3 weeks of a diet of delicious Chinese food it was a nice change to try the Vietnamese style of food at 4Corners. We recommend the summer rolls and the chicken curry. Good value and great staff.","5 из 5 кружков","F856320CF16C338598E88858DB54A2F1","Отзыв написан 29 октября 2014"
"Got a tip from a guide book to head here and took a punt. We were not disappointed. The food was first class and the staff and general ambience were excellent. We went on open mic night and the entertainment was great. I'd recommend going for the ales too. A nice reminder of home.","4 из 5 кружков","0B9C3C1583470BEB479AE513B178B2AE","Отзыв написан 16 мая 2014"

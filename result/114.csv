"The concierge recommended this place. It was terrific. The locals go here, which is always a testament to the good places. Lots of broth, veggie, and meat options. There's also an awesome sauce/seasoning station. You'll be glad you went!","5 из 5 кружков","66C5CBFA4AE25BC0DA2069A2DE1CADEC","Отзыв написан 6 февраля 2017"

"This place was my final meal before leaving Beijing and I could not have asked for a nicer place. Whilst waiting for food you are given free drinks (black bean tea = amazing) and games to play with some small snacks. The main meal itself is a show to behold. I would recommend the spicy soup, it makes everything taste...

"This was my second visit to this restaurant and it didn't disappoint the great memories from the previous year. The service is great from the minute you walk in, drinks come quickly and help is on hand for ordering food. The food comes quickly too and the quality is really very good. I look forward to another visit.","5 из 5 кружков","A80A860C9708D5641C6A3B7C87B64E71","Отзыв написан 10 октября 2016"
"It's a chain Sichuan Hot Pot place and probably the best you can find. The food and service are fantastic. Never though a casual restaurant like this would have the service far better than some other fine dining places in Beijing. The staff are very polite, friendly and attentive. Your glass is never empty!! Be sure to order the fresh...

"Came here after reading reviews and can confirm that the experience is amazing. It's a chain hot-pot restaurant (this one is on the 7th floor of a mall for weddings!), but the service is absolutely incredible. They have iPads for ordering with pictures which means not speaking Chinese is not a problem, and you are treated like royalty (they even...

"Everything about this place is great. You can get a manicure or shoe polishing while you wait, and if you have long hair, they provide you with hair ties for your hair, and blankets to cover your coats and bags on the chair. They even give you a pouch to place your phone so that you don’t get soup on...

"We couldn't resist checking out this hotpot restaurant and we felt very welcome. Our waitstaff didn't speak any English but she doted on us and helped us cook and serve our dinner (I think as foreigners, she felt that we would starve otherwise). We ordered the hand spun Shanghai noodles, which was a great show to watch. We asked for...

"Very nice ambience. Great variety for food for steamboat pot. You could choose 2 different soup base. The price is value for money. The ingredients were fresh. You could order the handmade la mian and the server will perform by stretching the noodles in front of you and might tease you a little by swinging the noodles towards you. Very...

"Hai Di Lao is known for their impeccable service and delicious hot pot. The service is perfect. They give you plastic bags to protect your phones and aprons to protect your clothes. The waitress even put a coat cover on my chair to protect my coat. They give gifts to small children, and we got a free beautiful fruit plate...

"We went to this restaurant after a tired day touring and shopping, when we reached there, there were so many people in the queue, we got a number and managed to get a seat at the waiting area. Drinks and snacks were served for us who were waiting, so it is not a bad experience to wait. Although the restaurant...

"Have been going to this restaurant for a number of years in San Li Tun. There are 3 floors of hotspot stations and if you turn up after 6:30 you will have to wait for a table.

"One of my first nights in Beijing we went to Hai Di Loa for hot pot - and what a fabulous time we had! We chose to eat vegetarian, but you could have just as easily included some meat or fish. The waitstaff helped us go through the menu, choosing what foods we wanted to include in our hotpot -...

"For the people who don't know, hot pot is a kind of restaurant where you actually cook your food on the table where you sit. Usually there is a kind of soup (spicy or not) and you can choose different ingredients to boil inside it. We chose shrimp balls, meatballs, vegetables, sliced beef and sheep, all were very tasty, the...

"Hai Di Lao Hotpot has many outlets in Beijing, we went to this restaurant at Xidan, Xicheng which is at the 7th floor in the same building with Xixi Yuyi Hotel. To me, the food is just as normal as ordinary, except it is more spicy than I ever tried if you are going with the spicy paste of hotpot....

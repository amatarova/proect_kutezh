"Choosing where to eat your Beijing duck is an equation with so many parameters. But if entertaining guests is one and friendly staff + good value counts high: this must be the place. The duck in itself did not have much to ask for..crisp skin and juicy meat. The condiments also included a top notch chili sauce like a rich...

"In one of the most peculiar streets of the hutong, DeYuan is the great alternative to the expensive and most known QuanJuDe. We were two and just asked to eat roast duck. We have been served with an entire delicious finely sliced duck and with small crepes, thinly sliced spring onions, cucumbers and sweet bean or hoisin sauce. We were...

"Good restaurant. Lot of choices good pictured and with english translation. We had Duck and Hot Tofu. It really tasted very good. The duck was juicy and the skin was crispy. We also got the duck's bones so nothing left. The Tofu was also nice and spicy. Service was good. We paid around 260 Yuan.","5 из 5 кружков","BA171E84F97A2AC236470579613E66EC","Отзыв написан 19 октября 2016"

"We didn't have the roast duck as two of the three of us didn't eat duck, but we did have some fantastic Chinese dishes such as chicken and peanuts, broccoli and a huge spicy battered shrimp dish that was basically impossible to finish between three of us (but still reasonably priced). Great food, great prices and a lively atmosphere.","5 из 5 кружков","0ACD07DEE356938D133BFC31E7D5431E","Отзыв написан 26 августа 2016"

"This was my first experience with Beijing Roast Duck and it was absolutely fabulous! We were given a massive menu of pictured dishes with English and Chinese description. We chose the roast duck because we had heard it's a must have while in Beijing. So glad we did order it and the price was extremely reasonable. The skin was crispy...

"My partner and I were slightly apprehensive eating at restaurants in Beijing for the fear of being ripped off (it's mostly me being a paranoid person after an incident at wangfujing market) but we read the reviews of deyuan and decided to give it a try. We were seated very quickly and ordered a roast duck. And honestly, it was...

"We had to wait about 10 minutes on a Saturday night at 8 pm to get a table. The place was packed with locals and very noisy but that didn't bother us in the least as it added to the atmosphere. Unfortunately we didn't know how much food we would get. Therefore we ordered the duck plus fried rice. The...

Cooked to perfection and beautifully...

"Such a great place to go and comes with all the sides. So cheap compared with other duck places. I recommend you come here and experience Beijing duck at a quarter of the cost. Very friendly staff.","5 из 5 кружков","6350574E64720BDCBF0818C957B194B6","Отзыв написан 2 мая 2016"
"The sought-after Peking duck can be expensive, especially compared to other meals in Beijing, but De Yuan is more reasonable and does not charge extra for the usual accoutrement. If you have a good appetite, you should order one duck for two or three people and a side dish or two. The service is excellent and more formal than the...

"We went here at the recommendation of the staff next door at the 365 Inn. It is supposed to be half the price of the Qianmen Quanjude Original Roast Duck Restaurant. Our understanding is that many of the locals like to come to this place. We ate this place 4 times and tried the Roast Duck and a variety of...

"Hyped as one of the best Peking duck restaurants in Beijing! It certainly doesn't disappoint. For less than <U+00A3>15 you are served a freshly cooked duck, expertly carved in view and served on 3 plates, skin, breast meat and combined fat/meat. Pancakes and condiments are included and for <U+00A3>1 extra you can have the bones and carcass made into a...

"The roast duck here is fantasic! When you order the whole duck, they slice it into small pieces and bring it out with thin pancakes, cucumber, plum sauce, and green onions. Assemble the meat, sauces, and other ingredients on the pancake and wrap and eat like a burrito or soft taco. The meat is very good by itself, too. Afterwards,...

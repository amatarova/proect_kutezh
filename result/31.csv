"We tried this restaurant at the recommendation of our hotel concierge and were very pleased. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We ordered the chef's tasting menu and enjoyed a range of local specialties, including Peking roast duck. The food was superbly prepared and the duck was carved tableside. Lots of interesting flavors and dishes I wouldn't have selected...

"Sleek, modern and engaging restaurant with view of food preparation and duck roasting. As someone who travels to BJ once a month for work and have tried at least 30 Peking Duck restaurants in BJ, this place belongs to the upper half. I have way better and I also have way worst. Super convenient if one is staying at the...

"This is one of the more expensive peking duck options in Beijing. The atmosphere is sleek and modern. The wine list offered some lovely choices but the prices were off the charts.

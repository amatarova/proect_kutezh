"Have eaten here a couple of times, as very clean and unintimidating. There are 'Duck's tongues' & 'Fried pig's intestines' etc: on the menu but if you are cautiously new to China, there's plenty of things you do recognise & perhaps feel safer with! Service very attentive. Chop sticks only.","5 из 5 кружков","9F48E9DAFD9A023C649A4B312F21E305","Отзыв написан 4 декабря 2015"

"What more to say? The locals packed the place at lunch; we were seated because we were with a guide that frequents the place with his guests. Service was harried but with the amount of people and food that was being served it was completely understandable. Our guide ordered for us - some things we wouldn't likely have tried on...

"We ate at this place twice and it was really good. The first time we went we noticed that EVERYONE was getting the foil wrapped chicken and some sort of fruit drink.

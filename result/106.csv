"One bar. Two tables. Ten people. Three hundred or so crafts beer from all over the world. Doesn't take much more really, if done right, to be my favourite bar. The gin and tonics for a mere 15 Yuan where just the frosting on the cake. Had a really good time in both visits. Kind bartender, social guests.","5 из 5 кружков","1987C51CBC08D212FB6B45D24E2F5A37","Отзыв написан 20 января 2017"

The owner is amazing and cool, and offers great recommendations. Note that they don't offer food here but you can order deliveries. Also there is no bathroom here but...

Beers averaged around 35 RMB for bottles of beer I'd...

They didn't have it, but the owner said they'll try to get it. Cool! They have a broad choice of American and Belgian beers.","5 из 5 кружков","038D92DB8F338704E512335B287B0923","Отзыв написан 7 ноября 2015"

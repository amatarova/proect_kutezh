"The food was correct. Nothing spectacular, nothing wrong neither. The service was perfect, actually the chef just came by to ask about the food, which is appreciated. It is inside a mall but completely isolated from it. The decoration a bit strange but I value the boldness in this aspect. I would say that is a bit overpriced and you...

"We had. Wonderful Sunday brunch here. True, it seems a bit pricey for Beijing but it was totally worth it. For 330RMB we had a meat/salmon platter, and egg dish each, beef Wellington and a desert. All delicious. The staff are attentive and friendly and the place has a good wine list. It will not be out last visit.","5 из 5 кружков","2F3FF716AE3728862C7318D9C2D3C014","Отзыв написан 12 сентября 2016"

"This restaurant is located in a prime mall of Beijing, Park View Green. Well known for the Chef Bombana name, this is a very good restaurant in a more casual setting (when for example compared with Mio) serving good quality food. The dishes are well prepared, however I think a bit too expensive for what you get.","4 из 5 кружков","57E05F79484CA4038735ADE363FBA830","Отзыв написан 28 марта 2016"

"The place is located in the basement of a popular shopping mall. The decorations are elegant although it could be very noisy at times. The services are generally great. The food is of high quality which is as expected given its association with 81/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana in Hong Kong, the only Michelin 3-star Italian restaurant outside Italy! There...

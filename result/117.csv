"I've visited the restaurant on the weekend for lunch. It was pretty quiet. There was a lot of light, and the decoration was pretty nice. Elegant with only a bit of a Chinese touch. We went for my Birthday, we order some pasta, a couple of entrees and a tuna tataki. Everything was delicious, although the tuna was minimalistic, let's...

"I organized large dinner with some fellow Italian expats in Beijing. Excellent reviews from all. Chef Mauro Portaluppi and manager Frank Hao have shown great professionalism and creativity in a very well balanced and fresh Italian cuisine. A bit pricy, but worth the experience. An interesting surprise is the pizza, cooked in an authentic wood-heated oven. Try the ""pizza Christine"",...

"Tavola has been my favorite place to eat for years now, one of the rare place in Beijing where you can get authentic Italian food (approved by my Italian collegues who are very picky trust me).

"There are two outstanding things here. One is service. You can witness it the moment you go across the door. They're magnificently well trained. Impeccable is the word. Service in Beijing lacks the concept of courteousness observed in Vietnam, Cambodia let alone developed countries. Their service is refreshingly pleasing. The other thing to stand out is the price.

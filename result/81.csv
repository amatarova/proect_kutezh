"Great to have only vegetarian options for a change. I don't see why some people would be upset about the food looking like meat sometimes, I loved the fact that I could try vegetable dishes but also try some dishes like shashlyk (kebab) that I have seen everywhere but could never try as a vegetarian. The food was delicious!","5 из 5 кружков","DB4FEEB89908FC395E8C30A3E8A67C90","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"

"The entrance to the Baihe (Lily) Vegetarian Restaurant is through a small store which sells organic products and has some very stylish clothing.

"Which I'm not, but they have put a great twist on vegetables by serving them to look (and taste somewhat) like meat! Ok, first things first.

"We liked it so much, we ate there twice. I have never tried so many vegetarian dishes pretending to be meat/fish!

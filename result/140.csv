"Capri is a small Italian restaurant tucked on the ground floor of a building just off Jianguomenwai Avenue. It is a short walk from the Silk Market. I eat here often with business colleagues, having lunch here every 2-3 weeks. I have only tried the pasta and pizzas here, but all have been very good. The Spaghetti Carbonara is the...

"Very good Italian food and drink at reasonable prices. The menu is in Chinese and English. The wait staff speaks excellent English and the service is prompt, efficient, and friendly. I liked it so much I ate there three times over an eight-day period. The restaurant is about 150 yards from the front entrance of the Fairmont Hotel toward the...

"What a welcome surprise to find this little place near the Fairmont Hotel. After having all the good Chinese food there is to try in Beijing I thought I would take a break eating Italian? Yes I went there 2 of my dinner nights and I absolutely enjoyed it. Very cozy place with excellent service. The Caprese Salad was very...

"The place itself is in an uninspiring concrete box that is part of a larger building. The view is out onto a dull side street. The service is fine but ... The garlic bread had no noticeable garlic. The minestrone soup was not like any minestrone soup I've ever had (except in China) it was essentially cabbage and celery in...

"We found this restaurant high up on tripadvisor and located just down the road from our hotel - Fairmont Beijing. Is on the road leading to the tube station/silk market. Restaurant is quite small and when we arrived was only 1 other person eating - was around 5pm, so not much atmosphere. Is a nice change from Chinese food. It...

Completely happy with the food and pleasantly surprised with the complimentary bread with tomato relish and fish pate.

"Just finished dinner here and, I have to say, it was pretty good. Located steps away from the overpriced restaurants at the Fairmont, the food was tasty and reasonable. Wine list was good and the staff very helpful and friendly. I would recommend Capri to anyone looking for a change from Chinese food.","4 из 5 кружков","E1A024E012FAEDB30435810D918A709A","Отзыв написан 29 декабря 2014"

"While staying at the Fairmont we visited Capri. Clean, friendly and comfortable. What more could you ask for? The food is better then the Fairmont by far and 1/2 the price.

"Literally a short walk of a couple of minutes from the Fairmont Beijing – on the right side of the road, on the way to the Metro. Enough English is spoken here & we were very comfortable returning to this restaurant more than once! The Italian food is incredibly good, fresh and tasty. Great food and great service.","5 из 5 кружков","50397CCB081E364E6F92C4862C94144F","Отзыв написан 9 сентября 2014"

"We walked past Capri a couple of times. We were staying at the Fairmount and had already eaten at both restaurants there. My husband and I went for a light meal on Saturday night. They had a decent wine list. I had pasta, my husband pizza. The service was SO nice. I truly hope more people try this terrific place....

"The entire meal was quite good. I'm still not entirely sure what all the fuss is about with the ""duck"" ceremony but as a meal, it's fine. I don't particularly relish duck as I don't see roast duck as requiring quite the fanfare, but one does enjoy duck on occasion.

"Aside from their famous peking duck, Da Dong offers a wide selection of tasty food just waiting to be eaten. The only downside to coming here is that no matter how fat your wallet may be it's bound to shed a few pounds.","5 из 5 кружков","E251784EB295A1462EE9767F0BD2B08E","Отзыв написан 7 августа 2015"
"We went to the Da Dong and had the roast duck. We loved the service. They showed us the roast duck, and then the waiter cut it up and put it on trays.

"The home of peking duck, but I liked the veal stir fry even more. The servers have very limited English so be sure to leverage the photo book for your order. I found out later that most customers pick their duck and watch them cook it. We didn't get that option, but the chef did slice table side. Excellent duck....

"Loved this place. Asked the hotel where we could get the best Peking Duck and this was where they said we should go. They were absolutely right. Not cheap, and quite classy, but so worth it.

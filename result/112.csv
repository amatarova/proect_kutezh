"The place was hard to find and our cab driver struggled. A common problem with taxis in Beijing. They pretend to know, generally they don't. The restaurant is located in a new trendy area of the Sanlitun district. An expat favourite, reminiscent of Xintiandi in Shanghai, where the good is never far from the very bad. Let's say that Duck...

"If you want to enjoy an excellent Beijing duck in a good environment and with great service, this is your place. The atmosphere is very nice, with not very bright lights and low sounds. The cut the duck in front of you (as should be done) and the rest of the dishes in the menu are just as good. I...

"Walking through an art Gallery and a beautiful courtyard at the 1949 Hidden City to arrive at the Duck de Chine was a nice touch. The sculptures in the Courtyard are rotated with frequency. The Duck served was absolutely amazing. I wish I had read a review first to know that I should have ordered one duck per two people....

"We were recommended to try this place by fellow travellers we met en route round China.

"Duck de chine likes to open in hip areas of Beijing and give you the experience of a imperial courtyard dining. It does its job well. The food is superb and service is attentive.

"One of our friends lives in Sanlutan village and recommended this place. Sanlutan village is expat central, so most everything in this area is kind of westernized.

"We really like the pizza here, as well as some of the other dishes. I'm willing to forgive poor service for great food, which is why we've returned. However, I think their sister restaurant in Sanlitun is the better overall deal. This spot is good for kids--especially as it's near Kids world, and the generally kid friendly Solana mall is...

The sauce I would love to...

"The second La Pizza Restaurant opened in Beijing, we even met his owner! Real Italian taste products: Pizza, lasagna, salads, risotto, and other hand-made pasta dishes. Be aware that this is not Annie's Restaurant, and the recipes maybe different. Recommended for couples on weekends.","4 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 20 марта 2016"
"We rolled in around 2:30 PM for a late lunch. Not crowded but busy, we were immediately seated. My wife and I both ordered a salad, we could have shared as they are enough for two. Both salads were fresh and delicious. We ordered the margarita pizza. It was also fresh and delicious although it can out in a strange...

"If the owner is in, the service is attentive, the pizza is delicious, and this makes the prices bearable. When the owner is not in, it is a messy, dirty, careless service as we experience in so many other restaurants in Beijing.","4 из 5 кружков","7B9358419668E6DE738DBB5F3C3BB464","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2014"

"Best pizza in town so far. I know that the chef moved, so let's see what will happen. Pizza, calzoni, focaccia and baci are really delicious and typically Italian. Pasta is ok, but would never go there for anything else but pizza!! On the other hand prices are quite high, especially for drinks.","5 из 5 кружков","1035CED621B30C7567B87A419A8AD7B6","Отзыв написан 6 января 2012"

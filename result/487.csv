"This restaurant offers authentic Indian food, but a very pricy one. The chefs, the waiters and the manager are Indian and the dishes are great. From time to time they have lunch sets, so if you want to try their food for a reasonable price, go there during lunch time.","4 из 5 кружков","2E1DD600CE87C17B3C9F62743FDE37E0","Отзыв написан 24 сентября 2016"

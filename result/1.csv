"We had a wonderful dining experience at TRB from start to finish. There were so many nice little surprises from the welcome glass of champagne to the delicious cookies packed in a box to take home. My husband and I ordered a different number of courses and without saying a word they brought him a bowl of soup ""on the house"" so that he had something to enjoy while I ate my salad. The food was unique, beautifully prepared and absolutely delicious!","5 из 5 кружков","CEDCD18F4EA12F514BCC3504BE23539F","25 февраля 2017"
"It is a magical place with quite a Chinese feel updated with Western renovation. The French food is probably one of the best in Beijing which is of good standard. It offers a pleasant experience of east meet west and the place will be a good place for entertainment. The bill might set you back a bit though and is perhaps the price to pay for good enough French cuisine in a place where standard is still needing improvement.","4 из 5 кружков","10BB15BDB3D7384F388A72F58887A558","14 марта 2017"
"Ok. It is not an easy place to find, but worthy the effort. It is located inside a Hutong in a 600 years old temple. Beautiful place with an elegant mix of old and modern china. The food is great. One can choose ""a la carte"" menu or set menu. Nevertheless, what impressed us most was their service. Top of the class. It is a kind of restaurant that would be great in any other place in Europe or North America. World Class. Congrats for TRB team!!!","5 из 5 кружков","B9E50873391E563B56DCE8CC6FD83DE5","8 марта 2017"
"Our last evening in Beijing after 3,5 years. And we picked the TRB at the place to say good bye to this tremendous city. Everything was just perfect. Food, wine and the definitely best service in Beijing. Thanks TRB team for all the great evenings during the last years and especially for this unforgettable last one.","5 из 5 кружков","605FB58B74F2147C0E6E8EEA666F9A48","27 февраля 2017"
"What a great find! Fantastic restaurant in a great location. We came here as a party of 8 and all had such a lovely time. We were greeted with a complimentary bottle of champagne and some appetisers. The service was excellent and the food very western. We paid for 3 courses and were served around 6! We also all got a tin of baked French goods to take home. Will definitely come back when in Beijing next.","5 из 5 кружков","999A3F6B32397EF160690ABAB7A3061B","26 февраля 2017"
"The quality of the food is good to great.

Service is subpar at best. Slow and forgetful waiters. Slightly arrogant receptionist. One of these overweight old guys who thinks being arrogant equals good service and makes guests feel welcome.

When leaving the restaurant we had to yell to get a waiter to show up and bring us our coats. No smile or thank you when leaving the restaurant. At 3000 CNY/RMB for lunch for 4 people, the service is a joke.

Overall experience = Not worth the money.","3 из 5 кружков","E434CA57928D8A2D87D40D8FA538E51F","22 февраля 2017"
"Had dinner last night, family of four with two young kids. The staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, providing custom food and drinks for the girls. From the moment we walked into the beautiful courtyard until we were driven back to our hotel in their private car, everything was exquisite. Our family welcomed a high end evening away from the hustle and bustle of Beijing. Next time I'm in town this will be on my list again! Thank you Ignace and team for a memorable evening!","5 из 5 кружков","B67B0497EE4A2F73F88F7EB9FB45FFCE","20 февраля 2017"
"I made another visit to one of our favorite French restaurants that happens to be 8,000 miles from home.

In ten words or less, Temple Restaurant Beijing is worth the trip. My wife and I have been going about three times a year. I guess that makes us regulars.

I arrived a few minutes before noon. This is an important detail because it helps track the pacing of the meal. I had a tasting menu, because I asked them to make all the selections for me.

On this trip, I was dining on my own. The restaurant was pretty full for lunch. Although I was seated at a table for one, the next table consisted of four stylish young women who meet the ""ladies who lunch"" description.

The meal started with a glass of champagne. As I observed other tables, being served a sparking wine on the house was standard practice for everyone.

The amuse Bouche was a zabiyone with a cooked egg served in a footed porcelain bowl.

Fois gras pate was the first official course. The slices were long and thin, as if sliced from a tart. They included various toppings including popping sugar. This was served with a Chinese rice wine that was very similar to a Sauternes. I ate it in tiny bites, closing my eyes as I did. It was very good,

Next, a seafood course arrived, accompanied by a Spanish Albarino wine. This included sea urchin, three large lumps of caviar, cauliflower puree and burnt califlower. (For real)

Next, another seafood course followed. This was accompanied by a white burgundy wine. The primary ingredient was Icelandic halibut, yet it was served with two triangular ravioli. The wrapper was thinly sliced radish, not pasta. The filling was mashed potato! Wow!

It's now 1:00 PM.

Next the meat course arrived. This was a piece of wagu beef, about 5"" x 1"" x 1"". This doesn't sound large, but the cumulative effect of the multiple courses and the accompanying dishes made it more than enough. It also included wagu beef carpaccio and a small, clear dish of short ribs topped with mashed potatoes. Although it's an overused expression, this dish was a taste explosion. Each little bite had great flavors. I ate slowly.

The meat course was served with a Shiraz Cabernet blend from Australia.

By this time, it was about 1:30 PM.

Dessert followed. It was served with a muscat dessert wine. The dessert was their interpretation of mango cheesecake. This involved seven inch tall cylinders of mango sliced into ribbon. Each was stuffed with cheesecake. There was a dense mango sauce in the plate. When you ran a spoon through it, the sauce stayed separated.

It's now 1:45 PM.

The restaurant has a tradition. They serve a small round chocolate cake, about 3 inches in diameter. They take a photo which is developed and presented in a cardboard frame by the time the bill arrives. At the table of four women next to me, each was given their own copy of the photo.

From my point of view, this is about as perfect as perfect can get. It's about 2:00 PM when the meal is over.

Are there drawbacks? Although the restaurant is located in the center of Beijing, it is in the middle of nowhere. I wandered in one direction a couple of visits ago and eventually found a subway station. This time I asked the hotel for directions. They suggested I circle the building and head right, which I did.

This deposited me in a hutong, a neighborhood of one story homes on narrow streets similar to alleys. No street signs, but since this is China, I probably wouldn't have been able to read them anyway. However, all the homes were freshly painted in a uniform grey and very well maintained. For those familiar with Brooklyn, it was the Park Slope of hutongs. Eventually I found a Main Street and a subway station. Three trains later I was back on familiar ground.

As you can tell, it's worth the trip.","5 из 5 кружков","62A9BACEA689664B5BB7E5DA93614CE7","15 марта 2017"
"Have lunch or diner here is a perfect combination of visiting a temple of same age than the Forbidden City and tasting kind of the franch style food, I love both chinese history and ""le cuisine francais"". Their foods are refined. The service is the best of Beijing, waiters are attentive but discreet, the ambiance is intimate. TRB is where I go for lunch or diner with my family or best friends as often as possible.
I highly recommend for both who live in BeiJing and who visit BeiJing","5 из 5 кружков","16DEC41C770181C414C96C5BAA2629AE","25 февраля 2017"

"We ate here on our last night in Beijing. The food was offered with a nice variety of 3-5 course selections and my boyfriend asked for the chef recommended wine pairings for each course. I am a very picky eater and I found every bite absolutely delicious. More outstanding was the service. From the moment we stepped inside until we left in the restaurant car every detail of our experience was artfully choreographed. The ambiance was intimate, modern and sophisticated. And we were even presented with a going away cake for desert with pictures of us to take away later. I highly recommend this restaurant is you are looking for an exceptional experience.","5 из 5 кружков","CEF17D9551EB4D8EEA823AA0E2E93B0A","14 февраля 2017"
"I have now been in this place 3 times for Dinner & Brunch and I have to give my compliments to the team there for doing a great job.
Interesting, but a bit hard to find location (hidden in an old Temple compound)
Lovely interior design run by a French Maitre'D & Chef couple who train and lead there team very well. Surly one of the best Western fine dining Restaurants in Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","879CA2198BFEADA762BACDECD736DABF",""
"The total experience is special and we enjoyed the food, service and we think value for money is also great by international city standard.

Venue:
This place is hard to find as it hidden in a narrow ""HuTong"" near forbidden city. Just when we thought we got lost, we saw many luxury cars parking outside a temple looking door. Here we found it. The road lead to the restaurant is very classic Beijing and nothing fancy. But once you arrived, you will a small heaven hidden inside. The temple is peaceful and calm with some interesting sculptures and a art gallery. The actual restaurant is build inside a temple as you can tell by the roof. We loved the venue a lot.

Service:
Let me out this way, apart from the staff English is not perfect, everything else associated with the service is. Staff speak very fluent English just with local accent. Nothing wrong at all.

To compare the service, my husband and I even thought it is better than two two-Michelin-starred places we have been recently (one in LA and one in London).

Flawless and with a personal touch. You can even feel the greeting from the kitchen as chef prepared special desert to welcome us as first time visitor.

Food and wine:
There is a serious wine book all in English. Plenty good choices and we tried a Chinese red wine as a test and it was very nice.

Food is fine dining standard with plenty options. The only criticism or improvement advice I would say on the food is that it is a bit ""fine dining as usual"". What I mean is that we have similar food in all other cities and it feels lack of identity.

The food itself is fantastic but lack of innovation and creation in my view. When opening a fine dining restaurant in one of the most historical city (including history of food), I would expect more from the menu. Something creative, something with a East-West twist and something different from a fine dining restaurant in other city of the world.

I appreciate that local Chinese might like pure authentic French food so my above comment is purely driven by personal preference.

All in all great experience at a reasonable price by international standard. We would love to come back next time in Beijing and hope to see some surprise in menu.","5 из 5 кружков","304C76A8444E2A2341A24337D76BDB23","Отзыв написан 5 февраля 2017"
"I could write a book on why I feel the restaurant is the best I have experienced in the last 20 months of my expat life here. For starters, the entrance and ambience. The restaurant is in a temple. Can u beat that. Prime location, and once ur in, u forget ur anywhere in beijing. Great food, awesome surprises, and fantastic service. Met the general manager Stephen here (by the way he also manages the other TRB bites) and he remember me from my last visit from the other restaurant 2 months back. Generous and intuitive service. I am generally critical about dining experiences, but they did not let me find any faults. Again, ask him to recommend a meal, and he will not let u down. The staff is eager to assist, the local and a few expat staff are proactive (rare in china).

"It was an experience which can't be expressed in words. I had gone there as my wife booked a table for us in order to celebrate our anniversary. Right from the moment we entered, we were pampered to the core by its wonderful staff. The food was simply incredible and it's the best French cuisine and international cuisine one can have. Right from the complimentary starter snacks to the desert, every piece of food item was served with love, compassion and the most exquisite toppings. I had the best salmon till date in my life and also the special complimentary delicacies made our anniversary a really special one. The best table was kept for us, every time we were served a dish we were reminded by its lovely and adorable staff that it's our anniversary. In the end we were served a surprise cake and a gift. Trust me, I have the experience of dining in some of the best fine dining restaurants across the world but TRB is not a restaurant, it's an one of its kind experience one can have in Beijing. Right from its exquisite location inside hutong to the splendid collaboration between modern decor and ancient Chinese architecture, everything was just perfect. Their staff, including Sara, Ignace, Ricardo, were simply fabulous and we never exprienced a better service than this.","5 из 5 кружков","3BBA1EC958CEADA7021FE8128A698D13","Отзыв написан 30 января 2017"
"I was there for a business dinner with twelve others, but the service was still efficient even though we didn't order the same menus. The portions are small so you don't feel overstuffed. There were also nice surprises, such as I got a bowl of ice-cream with strawberries even though I just ordered de-caf cappuccino for dessert. The presentation of the dishes are very delicate and artistic while the food itself is tasty, meat not overdone, fish moist, and vegetables still have a bit of bite to them.","5 из 5 кружков","CE413DBFAC782C6EA1AF270902970EF5","Отзыв написан 26 января 2017"
"We returned to Temple Restaurant Beijing (TRB) during our most recent visit to Beijing. Bottom line: if we can go to just one restaurant in Beijing, this it it. It's one of the major reasons we keep returning to Beijing from the Philadelphia area.

We have always come for lunch. They do a nice three course lunch for 198 RMB, which is about $29 USD. In reality, it's about a seven course lunch counting all the extras they throw in. I don't think anyone gets everything, but everyone gets a few extras. Plan on two hours plus. FYI: they usually throw in a glass or two of wine.

On this occasion we brought a guest. Everyone ordered different courses. My if and I left the choice up to the staff. We were waited on by Vivian and Alvin. When you keep coming back from 8,000 miles away, we take the time to learn names.

Here are the highlights:

They started us with an amuse bouche of four small tastes, each under an inch in diameter. This was accompanied by Domaine Chandon sparkling wine. FYI: the LVMH folks produce this in China!

Next came a porcelain bowl on a pedestal. It contained an egg dish, which my wife described as a variation on Zabigone. This was another extra.

Now time for the first course. One person had the gravlax, cured salmon covered in dill, sliced at the table. I had this oyster and caviar dish, with oysters tempura on the side. It was served in the largest oyster shell I've ever seen. I took a photo with a pen across the top to show the scale. My wife had a scallop and caviar dish. All of these were great!

Next came another extra. It appeared to be crab ravioli, yet instead of using pasta, the wrapping was thin slices of radish! Wow! The ""disk"" in the center was powdered seaweed!

Time for entrees. I had the beef, which was about an inch by an inch by about five inches long. It was accompanied by two small disks of wage beef carpaccio served on a section of bone. When I shared the wage beef, they brought out a third disk so we could each have one.

Another of us had the lamb. That was quite good too. My wife had the halibut, about the same sized portion as my beef. I tried it and it was great.

Time for dessert. I had a dense chocolate cake with chocolate disks on top. It was accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by powdered chocolate. Our guest had a meringue bowl with milk that was somehow turned into solid sheets. Ice cream held it together.

My wife had the standout dessert. It was mango cheesecake, only the mango was tiny tubes with cheesecake piped inside. It was served in a pool of mango sauce!

Then small pastries arrived, another extra. There were three per diner. Finally they presented a small, shiny, round chocolate cake. This is a standard thing they do, because it's included in the photo they take of diners at the end of the meal! Moments later a printed color photo is presented to diners in a cardboard frame.

Can this get any better? It's hard to believe, but the French couple who run the place (chef and maitre'd) were both back home in France for a short break. They were able to deliver this quality of food and service through the rest of their team. That is amazing.

You can tell we love the place. We keep coming back!","5 из 5 кружков","62A9BACEA689664B5BB7E5DA93614CE7","Отзыв написан 18 января 2017"

"We had been to TRB a few times in the past, but those experiences did nothing to prepare us for what we would experience on our most recent visit.

The setting remains one of the loveliest in Beijing, and the wonderful staff provides impeccable service.

Shortly after being shown to our table, we were greeted by Oliver. I hesitate to call him our waiter, because his warmth, sincerity, dedication, and attention to detail were so natural and complete that he was much more like a combination of guest relations officer and old friend. Throughout the meal, he went to great lengths to ensure that we had the best possible experience, and yet it all seemed effortless to him.

Service is important, but every restaurant lives and dies by its food. The food at TRB is among the most spectacular anywhere. Indeed, the offerings on the business set lunch compared favorably to some of the most creative cuisine we had tasted at Jose Andres's Las Vegas restaurant, ""e"" (with a rising accent over the e). While molecular cuisine sometimes can feel contrived, there was nothing gimmicky about what we were served. Everything was done in the name of flavor, and everything was excellent. Moreover, it was all achieved for around RMB200 per person!

It is now apparent that TRB is a destination dining establishment. Not only is a visit to Beijing incomplete without a meal at TRB, people might want to start thinking about traveling to Beijing with the sole purpose of eating at TRB.","5 из 5 кружков","FD65025AF5C1E76E7DC81FC1F2BCCEC4","Отзыв написан 4 января 2017"

"Sometimes you have an experience that is so exceptional that it causes you to recalibrate everything that came before with new eyes. Such was our visit to TRB on my recent birthday. Every dining experience I had before it is now lessened. I have dined before at fine restaurants, including several Michelin star places in both the south of France and the USA (NYC), but our experience at TRB was second to none. We arrived and were asked if we wanted a drink at the bar or to go direct to our seats, and chose to go right in. No problems or delays that seem to have been experienced by some other diners. I ordered one of the taster meals with wine pairings. My wife ordered some vegetarian dishes from the a la carte menu. The food was of a consistent high standard throughout, easily matching my (admittedly limited) previous Michelin star experiences in both quality and quantity. The food was spectacularly tasty. The portion sizes were lets say ‘more than filling’. The bread supply alone was enough to feed a small family. But that wasn’t what made it special. From the second we started there were so many little touches that made the evening memorable. To mention just one. Because I was having the taster menu I had one more course to eat than my wife. The staff recognized this. They didn’t say anything but without asking prepared a small extra vegetarian dish for her for free, so that she had something to eat at the same time I did. That attention to detail is just stunning. To cap things off at the end the wine waiter asked which of the wine pairings I had enjoyed the most, and then promptly brought us back two generous glasses of it. The level of conversation from the wait staff was friendly but unobtrusive and they just hit that fine balance exactly right. The sommelier was excellent – knowledgeable, but not keen to bore us to death with it. At the end after we collected our coats, probably having drunk too much, a waiter walked with us down the road until we were safely inside a taxi and on our way home. Tripadvisor doesn’t do 6 stars. If it did this was a six.","5 из 5 кружков","A66C8980CD2177D8CEFE60A7EE4B53E8","Отзыв написан 2 января 2017"
"We joined some friends for a dinner party and were immediately impressed by the temple grounds and the intimate setting of the restaurant -- like much of Beijing, rich in history. The dining area was dimly-lit with pleasant ambiance. The team of servers were quite a bit more attentive than what one normally experiences in Beijing, and their insistence on English-only (even with myself and a Chinese patron attempting to speak Mandarin Chinese) was a unique feature as well. The food arrived early and often, in small-but-frequent courses of upscale Western cuisine that left the palate intrigued and satisfied and various ""surprises"" that were welcome treats. While TRB clearly targets wealthy expats as its clientele niche, we were pretty astounded at the price of the meal (and also at the graciousness of our friends for hosting the meal) in relation to the quantity of food (flavor notwithstanding). To sum the experience of the restaurant and the food itself would yield something greater than four stars, and the pricing and over-the-top ""westernized"" service detract only slightly. However, the ""kicker"" was literally that: while I was seated at an outward corner of our table, a member of the waitstaff kicked one of the legs of my chair each time while passing by -- no less than around fifteen times throughout the meal -- an annoying distraction from an otherwise-good experience. If the staff tried as hard at navigating the bustling restaurant interior as they did at speaking English, this would have merited a four-star or ""Very Good"" experience.","3 из 5 кружков","6F3DD5C82F00F13E1720643930C010FE","Отзыв написан 1 января 2017"
"Dining in a refurbished temple...enough said! The restaurant was pretty hard to find so make sure you have good directions from the restaurant before you head out. It seems as though you are going through alleyways and then it's off to the side. But walking into the space is just amazing. The food- truly wonderful. Unique takes in eastern and western cuisine. Everything was delicious! The service was amazing as well and we were given a special 'welcome to China' dessert courtesy of the restaurant.

"We went for Sunday brunch...it's a little bit of a challenge to find, but the treasure is worth it!
The temple grounds are impressive. That being said, it was cold and snowing, so we spent most of our time inside.
The staff is really top-notch. Gracious, helpful, and very cheery. And quick to help us when our daughter -- at her first ""big-time"" restaurant, dumped her water all over the table.
The food is spectacular - both visually and to taste! The menu is set up to be able to order 5 of anything -- which gave the girls a lot of flexibility (they're 12 and 13) while my wife and I experimented more.
The breads alone are a meal. You really do have to try everything.
We thought we were done - then came out the 'extras' - both dessert nibbles and drinks.
Brunch was a 3 hour event - and easily could have been longer.

"Excellent multi-course dinner with friends in a reserved room for eight. Very difficult to find TRB, which is part of the charm. Immediately upon entering, a choice of some special drinks, we finished off the bottles of 71 and 73 Armagnac. Other choice whiskeys and wine; some wines were not available. The service and food were excellent, and the wine decanters are entertaining. Overall Price was mid-range, 2-3,000USD, with nice drinks in the private room. Will return with another small group, don't miss. Oh yeah, you even get photos at the end of dinner that the staff take and develop.","5 из 5 кружков","EF8752CCC5033F0D1213BB9F0055E688","Отзыв написан 3 декабря 2016"
"The tasting menu was lovely, and I hear they rotate the offerings every few weeks. However, the star of the show was the service. We went to Temple to celebrate my sister's birthday and it was the highlight of our day. The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant (I can not say the same for many of the high end restaurants of Beijing). Sarah the MatreD was very friendly and remembered my sister and details about her from when she went the restaurant with coworkers >6months before. She helped us select a reasonably priced amazing wine. The other staff were also great, we were waited on by Vivienne and 2 men who's name I did not catch. Will definitely return on future trips to Beijing.
Logistics:
- it's a little bit hard to find as it is buried in a hutong, and there isn't great signage. We used google maps but I would not head out without clear directions and writing the name of the restaurant in Chines so that people on the street can help you. (when we finally got to the restaurant there was a large door directly to the street which we had come to but were not permitted to go through, so maybe it was just closed when we came. If so then it is easy to get to)
- The staff speaks English, in varying degrees but enough to get whatever you need and if the person you are speaking to does not understand they will find someone to help
- If you are on a budget, go for lunch, we had a lovely 3 course tasting menu (plus the usual extra courses that come with a tasting menu), a bottle of wine and 2 bottles on water for less than $200 for 3 people
- The water was very expensive >10USD for ~1L","5 из 5 кружков","754D5C42695C8C368D55C8CF647FF669","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"
"Thank you, TRB, for another unforgettable culinary experience. All dishes were expertly prepared and plated. We loved every single course, especially the sweets. The restaurant itself was not easy to find, but definitely worth the effort.","5 из 5 кружков","A96A816643FF6B5CB90C038F1C1699C3","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"
"We have been remiss in not posting this review earlier. We visited for lunch in late September. The serenity, the service, the food - all spectacular. Temple has hit upon the ""secret"" to leaving guests with the feeling that the pricey lunch is priceless: the surprises throughout the visit. Cava as your friendly and exceptionally professional staff first come to your table? Complimentary. Was that the appetizer? No, that was a complimenary small course. Dessert? What we ordered, and also, a small cake drizzled with the words, ""Welcome to China."" (We'd let on it was our first trip, not realizing why our server had asked). Do not let fears of small portions enter your mind; it was nigh onto impossible to finish the desserts when we got to them. Bravo, Temple owners; may you continue to succeed, and may you in your kindness ensure to share the rewards of that success with your very deserving staff.","5 из 5 кружков","E162CD8C62C471C3B39F1B3B6DF69791","Отзыв написан 23 ноября 2016"
"My husband and I had dinner at TRB to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary. We had a wonderfully memorable evening - awesome food, excellent service and lovely ambience!

The dishes at TRB are unique, delicious and beautifully presented.

We had the 5 course set menus. Our favourite dishes are : Apple Foie Gras, Lobster & Beetroot, Grilled Oyster, Lobster & Pork Belly. The Milk & Blueberry and Chocolate desserts were yummy too.

Although it was a 5 course menu, they surprised us with appetizers in between some courses which were delightful and delicious.

We were very impressed by their warm friendly staff and impeccable service. A little pricey but highly recommended. One of the highlights of our trip to Beijing.

Print a map for the taxi driver. We didn't print one and our taxi driver had difficulty finding the restaurant as it is located in the hutong and the place is not well lit at night.","5 из 5 кружков","B0A113DE39664BF9FBF2E87CEE8B8C17","Отзыв написан 20 ноября 2016"
"Everything about this experience was spectacular. The venue is beautiful and the service was top notch. You can either pick one of the recommended set menus or pick your own. I picked my own along with the wine pairing. Even though some of the options were outside of my comfort zone, I enjoyed everything. There are a lot of little delightful surprises throughout the experience (this is more than just a meal). I loved every moment and felt welcome as solo traveler. Highly recommend!!","5 из 5 кружков","3B5ED46711FBDD974FB4F324C11A99F1","Отзыв написан 19 ноября 2016"
"I had a great evening here: I was by myself, and the staff was very friendly and did everything they could not to make me feel alone. :) The atmosphere is lovely, it's a beautiful setting and very peaceful.

Though I had to wait 30 minutes for my table, this was compensated for with generous top ups of bubbles. The food was very good, really enjoyed it. The staff came with good recommendations for wine as well.

They are paying attention to detail: a tiny stool for my bag was brought over, the GM came to say hello and check if all was OK, very attentive.

After dinner, getting a taxi took a while, but again, I was comfi waiting at the bar, while my drink got topped up.

It is a place that's not easy to find, make sure you print a map for your taxi driver, but once you find it, you'll love it.","5 из 5 кружков","6772981F51969FB091EACBD5EE85C68C","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"
"I have heard of the restaurant and always wanted to go. The reservation online is convenient and got a response immediately. The restaurant is also in contact through messaging to remind me and to arrange delays due to traffic.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with free proseco (a treat I only enjoyed in Italy!). The chef will also randomly give us appetizers from now and then which were completely exquisite. I had a gel like thing on a biscuit that explodes in my mouth with delicious tomato juice. The texture and the experience was fantastic. It's chef's tasting menu or a mixed and match tasting menu only. I had a two course but we were provided with ""surprise"" courses (soup, dessert and a cake at the end!).

The restaurant is in a restored temple and it is a beautiful courtyard that people can visit. There was also a movie projected on a wall outside the story of the restoration. Beautiful sculpture and a gallery with beautiful exhibit. Great experience just on its own. It is quite pricy and french (tiny amount!) but the food, service and experience all worth it.","5 из 5 кружков","9B6D1A7371999AE7EB332402A36C096D","Отзыв написан 16 ноября 2016"
"Since 2 years ago, I visited TRB for 4 times already for family gathering, friends gathering, and business appointments.
The location of TRB is a fun for all visitors to explore BJ in a little deeper manner:)
The dishes and environments are excellent. Nothing much to add.
All 4 visits were great!","5 из 5 кружков","3AB139DDDB89A9144ACF16CB564F65F0","Отзыв написан 16 ноября 2016"
"Saw friends post pictures of this restaurant & finally got the chance to try it.

Must admit that the food was very decent while the service was impeccable.

We ordered a bottle of sparkling & the staff still gave us some wine to accompany our dishes.

The food speaks for itself while we just cannot say enough about the service.

For foodies - Truly worth the experience!","5 из 5 кружков","44070CA07036CBE387E0B5203444B96F","Отзыв написан 16 ноября 2016"
"Housed in an old courtyard sitting next to the wall of the forbidden city, the restaurant has a stunning view - a very nice choice for dinner dates and special occasions.
The mix and match menu is a great idea, everything is delicious and elaborate, with the exception of the dessert which was rather at the level of a mid-range restaurant.
Very attentive service, and surprises for those celebrating a birthday.
Portions are rather small (expected at such a classy venue), but somewhat disappointing that the mains are the same size as appetisers - especially that dishes were so tasty!","4 из 5 кружков","CCF42FC146C9116B539AC7FC472487F5","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"
"This is a great change of pace from your typical Beijing fare and from your typical fancy food. I had trepidation beforehand because portion sizes at fancy restaurants are usually small and I'm never quite sure what I'm eating. At TRB they bring out not only your meal, but a plethora of free appetizers and even alcohol. The waitstaff was attentive and spoke great English. The location can't be beat nestled in beside the Forbidden City. I highly recommend this for a nice evening out.","5 из 5 кружков","37F8C32F0E566F28C85AD4575BC5CC82","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"

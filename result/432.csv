"I've eaten here three or so times and have not been disappointed. I've had a different burger each time and all have been excellent.

"I have been in Beijing 4 months and this place could be in Detroit or Dallas. The flavor is perfect. 60's music and decor. Drinks are in frosted mugs and very good. The burger was juicy, bun was very fresh with great sides. I will return often.","5 из 5 кружков","198058B618B65FBA7220F468EE20C433","ќтзыв написан 10 июл€ 2016"

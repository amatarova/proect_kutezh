"Located a 2-3 min walk from Chongwenmen station, this is really good value compared to Quanjude (another old name in the Peking duck business). We were recommended here by a local who gave us a guarantee that this was better than Quanjude. I totally agree. The portions are huge. The duck skin melts in your mouth. The duck soup boiled...

"Approximate RMB 200 for a Peking duck. As a foreigner, the taste is good enough for me. Something different and must try for Beijing. Convenient location, but hard to find restaurant, you need to enter via elevator adjacent to the shopping complex (next to a coffee shop). Take the lift to 4th floor there you will see the main entrance...

"For someone growing up in Bangkok and only ever had Peking duck in Bangkok, Bianyifang's traditional Peking duck was the best I've ever had. This does not pit it against other popular Peking duck in Beijing though.","5 из 5 кружков","79A665849D11C1ACBA2B5CFCAA09FD91","Отзыв написан 8 сентября 2016"

"Bian Yi Fang - Ha De Men location / <U+4FBF><U+5B9C><U+574A> (<U+54C8><U+5FB7><U+95E8>) is a fairly average Peking duck restaurant that is in a convenient (but hard to find) restaurant in Chong Wen Men (<U+5D07><U+6587><U+95E8>). Although it's sign is advertised in a large shopping complex it's actually not easily accessible from the shopping complex (take the lift in the lobby entrance adjacent...

"Not a fan of peking roast duck, only enjoy the outer crispy layer. Sauce is quite salty. Staffs are not friendly, in fact i felt a bit offended by the waiter for the way she talked.","3 из 5 кружков","C7CE02EA6ECA1B0A718ED4855FBAFBDA","Отзыв написан 6 мая 2016"
"We were recommended this restaurant by a local, he advised that this is the original Peking Duck restaurant in Beijing. It is also where a lot of locals eat as it is inexpensive and no waiting. It did not disappoint, the duck was great and carved and served at the table. Very tasty and not oily at all. We also...

"We ate here with some friends. It was interesting but if you aren't into duck, the rest of the meal was just so so. There was little variety and service was on the slow side.","3 из 5 кружков","878AC914AD1949285E0E7C82EF44B713","Отзыв написан 19 августа 2015"
"There is many Peking duck specialists in Beijing, Pianyi Fang may not be the most famous one, but it's food should be one of the best. Peking duck should be a must-try item in this shop. The skin of the duck was oily but crispy. the meat was tender and juicy.What I love most was actually their flour pancake, the...

"Any time we have guests visiting Beijing, this is one of our go-to places for Beijing kaoya (roast duck). They do a great duck, not to oily or fatty, with all the fixin'. Their regular menu is also very tasty. I usually order the ""beef and chinese mushrooms"" dish as well as some salads there. This restaurant never fails to...

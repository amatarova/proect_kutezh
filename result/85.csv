"The Ambience and Service is great but food is lacking in variety. We are Italian food connoisseurs and love to try Italian in every city as importantly it is very safe for my kid who has peanut allergies. I guess it is not fair comparing Beijing Italian with food in Italy but I was expecting more as the chef is...

"If you are looking for good Italian food, this is your place. Set inside the gorgeous Four Seasons hotel, this restaurant is equally as beautiful with good food and great wine list. Sexy decorations but not too fancy.","5 из 5 кружков","7478CBFBEC638D1C3EE5251E6AD5B320","7 марта 2017"

"I feel like I wen to a different restaurant from the negative reviewers. Anyways, the service from beginning to end was absolutely impeccable. Every one of the hosts/ waiters delivered amazing service that is more memorable than most of the Michelin starred restaurants I have been to. They really turned a meal for one into an experience. The bar is...

"Ate here twice during our stay at the Four Seasons and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The food was well presented, it was tasty and we were not hurried. If we had any other comment to make it would be that it did seem a little overpriced.","4 из 5 кружков","6CCFCC9ED364545E98152B6BE415FD0C","Отзыв написан 19 сентября 2016"
"The atomosphere is upbeat and fairly casual, considering it is in the Four Seasons. The brown butter and truffle past was absolutely delicious without being Too rich. The fresh baked bread was some of the nicest I have ever had at an Italian restaurant.

"Mio is a great restaurant located at Four Seasons. Serving Italian fine dining food. Food is well done by a Chef with great experience in top restaurants across the world. The service is regular. The set of the restaurant is very strange. You feel like being eating in any restaurant expect an Italian one. Very heavy decor and environment, full...

"Set menu 4 course at lunch, with a rather stingy pour of house wine, all for 250<U+00A5>. Food Portions are small, yet seemingly adequate. A stereotypical minestrone soup (yes, the international tomato based type!) was reasonable, lamb shoulder was tender and tasty, but more French in style than Italian. The chocolate dessert was perhaps the best of the bunch. Worth...

"I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants and the design at Mio is certainly the most memorable. I'm not even sure exactly how to describe it as there was so much going on - you definitely won't lack for something to look at if your dinner conversation hits a lull. Our food, while expensive - which isn't surprising given...

"This continues to be the best Italian restaurant in Beijing. The service is perhaps the biggest weakness, as it is a bit confused if the restaurant is busy. The wine list is also painfully expensive, as is usually the case in China. But apart from those points, the food here is really very good. Since the arrival of the new...

"Unfortunately after a long day at the Great Wall, this restaurant in our hotel seemed to be the best choice. Our group of 4 selected what we would call traditional Italian food.

"Not the best duck, but still quite good. The price is very reasonable. We paid just under 400 RMB for a whole duck and 3 or 4 other dishes. The other dishes were decent, but the duck was the star. We didn't have to wait long for our food either. All dishes were on the table within about 20 minutes....

"We enjoyed our experience at Pian Fang Roast Duck Restuarant. I am a foodie so loved watching the chef's expertly carve the roast duck for the tables. The food was delicious and tasty. The duck is carved for the pancakes. Worth the experience. The restaurant has 2 floors locals eat downstairs and tourists upstairs.","5 из 5 кружков","3DD02CF93A992054AF7D0B558A37403F","Отзыв написан 3 июня 2016"
"If you are going to the Red Theatre (only 200 m south), then this is a good place to have dinner. Yummy duck. It's crispy and juicy. Normally at other places, there's a 45 minute prep time for duck, but this restaurant has duck on your table at about 25-30 min. We had the option of having the duck with...

"The best duck we ever had! Very tasteful and well prepared. It was absolutely delicious! We loved it. The employees were very friendly and it was great to see how the cooks cut the duck in a special way. They showed it in the restaurant where we were eating.","5 из 5 кружков","B90DC42D56220CD1C3DCAE22F59797FA","Отзыв написан 26 октября 2015"

"really great food and a super reasonable price. They carved the duck right at our table, to make a nice event out of it (really... you go for the experience as much as the flavors).

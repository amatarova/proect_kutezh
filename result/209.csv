"Love the buckwheat crepe! Eggs are cook to perfection. The mulled wine is good esp it's winter in Beijing now. The steak and fries is good. Try the burger too. Over all satisfied.","5 из 5 кружков","97F5511F231EFC95FA9E8C1FB0EF7593","Отзыв написан 10 декабря 2016"

"First time in this restaurant and from the entrance to the lobby to my leaving everything was nice. They even help me to call a taxi. Very customer friendly. The choice in the menu is great and the service is high quality. I choose the wagyu Foie Gras burger and the flavours were intense !","5 из 5 кружков","48C122B2C1C0A85A3D36BDEDD7835827","Отзыв написан 19 октября 2016"
"Went here with friends....nice setting and service was ok, English speaking waiting staff seems to be a issue though... As for the food, bland & uninspiring, basically simple Bistro dishes were under seasoned, lacked flavour and were boring....

"Bistro B is a contemporary French Bistro that serves a mix of Asian & European inspired dishes. Casual open kitchen concept with high ceiling that gives the restaurant a sense of space. Excellent food. I recommend the steak tartare. And, I love the freshly baked oven bread.","5 из 5 кружков","D2C8238AA48C50DF1B1E4DB13132A3FF","Отзыв написан 3 октября 2016"
"It's almost needless to say that the food is amazing at Bistro B. The bread is the best I've had in Beijing. It's worth it to go just for that. The service there is what impresses the most. Last time I went I had a slight issue with my order and the manager took care of it very professionally. Looking...

"Decided to visit Bistro B for weekend brunch with my wife as it was recommended, we were not disappointed. The menu has a choice of 2 or 3 course with a mixture of Asian and Western dishes. I chose the Wagu burger which was really tasty and my wife chose a fish dish as main course. The service was friendly...

"We went based upon the rumours that it was supposed to be very good and based upon our night I would never use this hotel and most certainly never return to Bistro B. We travel regularly to Beijing The food ok and greeting at the bar good but from there it all went downhill. The service was dreadful and totally...

"Dined at ""Bistrot B"" while in Beijing on business this past January. I was staying at the Rosewood and had such good experiences with their other food options (room service, club lounge, Country Kitchen, MEI Bar) that I had to try Bistort B. I was not disappointed. Very elegant decor, competent staff and lovely food. I went for the wagyu...

We order the 2 people special with oysters, foie gras, pate, french onion soup, fish and meat as main, profiteroles for 2 and a bottle of champagne at mei bar. The foie gras had a lack of spice and they forget to devein it,...

"We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast at the Bistro B every morning during our stay at the Rosewood Hotel. The beautifully displayed buffet offers western as well as Asian cuisine plus a station for any-style eggs, fresh fruit and juices and anything else you might want. The staff is very efficient and helpful, although a number of them speak limited English.","5 из 5 кружков","3A4819667516E6D2581ABD4B23B5A252","Отзыв написан 21 октября 2015"
"Restaurant location is excellent, just close to China World, and few minutes driving from SKP Shopping mall. The restaurant is at ground floor of brand new Rosewood hotel. Atmosphere is refined, but very warm and relaxed. Menu choice is simple but comprehensive, very good for both Western and Chinese taste. Food is very good. Service is also very good. Prices...

"It sounds like an Italian restaurant but its French cuisine, and an international setting. Good bar, great wine lust, good steak. Outdoor smoking area and good seats. Difficult to get by taxi as not many know it. Got to the apartment entrance but all went well. The service was very ordinary and they got the orders wrong. They close early...

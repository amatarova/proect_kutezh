"A friend and I visited Mosto for lunch. The set menu of three courses is a good value and food was tasty. A nice selection for each of the courses is offered. We were fortunate to get a table on the outdoor deck with dappled sun and blue sky which always makes a day in Beijing better.","4 из 5 кружков","C6FA82F70EDE56BD97FF3FDDFD1C695B","Отзыв написан 25 июня 2016"
"Mosto produces consistently good food, straightforward meals cooked well. The most recent visit I had culminated with a special night for traditional Peruvian ceviche, tiradito and carpaccio - with different dishes bringing together fresh fish with chile, onion, and flavors such as mango , lemon and coconut. We had a taste of all of the varieties on offer- the seabass...

"Mosto is a busy shopping mall type restaurant. Service was slow the night we visited. Food good but not as good as the price tag suggests. Between us we had squid, tuna and food gras starters and halibut and steak mains. All as it should be. Good but nothing to say come back here rather than go elsewhere to the...

"This is was my common lunch place in Beijing. I loved the food and the great steak, one of the best i could get in Beijing.

"If you go to Mosto you need to go for Lunch. For 95 RMB, Mosto is one of the best Lunch Deals in the city. Pretty much everything on the lunch menu is great: soups or salads, the medallion steak, the pork chop, and for 15 RMB, add a dessert too. I have never had bad service here and most...

"Mosto is hands down the most consistently excellent restaurant in Beijing. Alex, the maitre d' and Danny the chef have pulled together a team than never fails to deliver on the service or food quality front.

"I add my good review after Mosto has been recommended by so many local reviews. I went there for lunch for a weekday, and it was really good. Loved by expatriats and locals alike.

"A group visit so tried lots of tapas style dishes and can't remember all of the good ones. Particularly liked the cold beetroot and goat's cheese soup - not a combination that would normally make my mouth water. Wine in China is generally very expensive but the cheapest red on the list was still pretty good. Unlikely to be in...

"One of my favorites in Beijing, especially over the summer when the terrace opened up - you can have dinner overlooking the other restaurants and seeing it all.

"Frequent Mosto patron. In addition to the attractive, quality wine selection the culinary experience is an enjoyable one every single time. The bustling yet ambient atmosphere is great for dinner.

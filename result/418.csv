"Good place to have a late night beer or cocktail. They have some good imported beer choices, and overall decent prices considering it is a high class pub in an excellent central location. I was totally satisfied with my 500cl Guinness, and they also have some good Irish whiskey (yes, they have some Jameson!). They also have some decent live...

"After reading some reviews my family and I decided to go to Molly Malone's for dinner. We arrived and the place looked very warm and inviting. We sat down and we're a little taken back by the prices as well as the portion sizes. The price wouldn't have been an issue if the portions were bigger. In the end, the...

"After two weeks of Asian food, I just needed a burger. I sat at the bar and had a great draft beer with an excellent burger and fries. Yes, I love very spicy Sichuan food, but after two weeks of touring, this was a nice break. Wagyu burger, fries and large beer for about US$ 28. Chinese women's weight lifting...

"Arrived at 9pm and the place was virtually empty. Ordered the wagyu burgers. Whilst they tasted ok, I have had better non-wagyu burgers. For the entire meal we had a waiter sit opposite us which was disconcerting. For two burgers and a couple of beers, the value was not great. Definitely better options in town. Overall ok, but not great.","3 из 5 кружков","8A638D58D7BF4C1FD0AE272E4EA41409","Отзыв написан 29 августа 2016"

"We stumbled upon Molly Malone's - located a short walk from our hotel. What a great find! The atmosphere is upscale/traditional Irish pub. The menu included an interesting and varied selection of traditional pub fare and unique choices. The Wagyu burger was absolutely outstanding - especially when paired with a frosty Belgian beer. We stopped in on three occasions during...

"That's what my 15 yo at old said. I will add to her high praise by saying the burger and fries blew Morton's away AND cost less (across the street).

"I have went to Assagi quite a few times in the last two years. In my opinion this is one of the best places to have something like a proper Italian pizza in Beijing (other is Tavola). While I like their pizzas, I'm not really a fan of their - priced quite high - set lunch menu. Unfortunately a la...

"Very good and tasty food,the people there were very friendly and new to speak English,also very clean.The only bad this was that the taxi driver did not know the place and it was not easy to find a taxi to go back to the hotel.","5 из 5 кружков","926230F6F11BFB125A3B535D5530572F","Отзыв написан 21 декабря 2016"

"The restaurant is located in Sanlitun embassy area. Outdoor seating was closed so we were seated inside. The restaurant itself is bright. They have reasonably priced set menus: 79, 98 or 128 RMB. Portions were reasonable, pasta was al dente. I didn't really see a lot of service people around but our male server was attentive enough. He even catered...

"It was my first time to Beijing. Thus friend decided to take me to have nice lunch in the embassy area. It was sunny day with blue sky (What a surprise!!). The restaurant is located in a nice neighborhood and felt good to walk around there. We were having lunch special where they have multiple choices with different price ranges....

"We regularly go here for our special occasions (valentine's, birthdays, anniversary) as we love the food and the ambience equally. The staff and the chef are very good. The chef is Italian and very accommodative especially since I am vegetarian. We love the set lunches during weekdays too. They also have a bakery and cafe and their stuff is very...

"We had a nice dinner at Assaggi. We were seated promptly, waiters were very attentive and spoke good English (a rarity in Beijing). Location is in Sanlitun, near the Jenny Lou market (where many foreigners go). First we got some snacks as an entree and we were served our drinks (beers) quickly. Wine list is quite extensive, though quite pricy....

"Italian food as it should be: simple, good and made with fresh ingredients. Excellent service of all the staff: from the entrance to the waiters/waitresses serving us at the table. Not the cheapest Italian restaurant in town but the final bill was definitely worth the experience. The fact that the restaurant survived Beijing's fierce competition for such a long time...

"Assaggi has been on the scene for more than 10 years and is still keeping a constant, successful very good level of food and service. It also opened a bar and a sweets shop nearby. The lunch menu is valuable with some traditional Italian pastas and second courses which are impossibile not to be liked. Giuliano, the owner is a...

"I am Italian, so I think I have some understanding of my country's food. Well, don't go. The food was not fresh, the pasta overcooked, and the service sloppy (table poorly set) and arrogant (""take it or leave it"" when we complained about the smell of the fish sauce). Enough said.","1 из 5 кружков","34542D891DFC2FFF1355251638E90181","Отзыв написан 20 февраля 2013"

"We were five for brunch and the hostess would not tell us that the restaurant was booked for a tour group, we were meeting friends who had invited us. Instead we were dragged next door to a small coffee shop where we could not all sit. The Italian host came rushing over to apologize. Thus we ended up here inbetween...

"Antipasto was Ok, but the main courses are extremely expensive and terrible , for a small boutique location. I would have enjoyed a visit to the deli next door more than dining here, if its just for a few decent slices of Parma ham. I ordered fish, which was obviously frozen, tasteless and textureless. For such a high cost, I...

"Climb to the rooftop on a summers night and have a few margaritas ! A good place to start off your evening before heading into Guloa ! The food is ok - the nachos never disappoint ! Burritos also deliver in flavor ! Tequila or two in this well located restaurant in Wudoajing hutong - a stones throw away from...

"A great restaurant, in a great location (Wudaoying Hutong), with great customer service and quality of food. Great value for money.","5 из 5 кружков","F86223D5DB8FAFA977D210FC43A76824","Отзыв написан 13 мая 2016"
"Simply put, we will never dine at Sand Pebbles Lounge again. We had heard such great things about this restaurant in Wudaoying Hutong. When we finally tried it we both couldn’t believe the reviews. My only guess is people start hitting the margaritas and then get hungry and anything tastes ok at that point? The service is slow and the...

"My first time coming here as its now known. I must preface this by saying that I cook my own Mexican food at my home on a regular basis here in China using authentic Mexican spices and herbs so I can say I know what I'm talking about. Plus I am Mexican and have been cooking the food for over...

"This place will always be a happy memory for me. The food was delicious and spicy, the beer keep flowing - the local brew. We were smiling, clinking our glasses on the rooftop and it felt like nothing could go wrong. It was just one of those perfect nights.","5 из 5 кружков","CA6367B1ABA535DD1F89EBDF66357AC9","Отзыв написан 18 апреля 2016"
"Pebbles Courtyard (as it's now known) is located on the increasingly popular Wudaoying hutong. I like the restaurant itself, it has a nice 'light and airy' feel to the place even though I never made it onto the rooftop. The serving staff are attentive and friendly whenever I've been there. I really like the burritos there. They are pretty good...

"Ambiance: They are located in an up and coming hutong which has not gone the way of nanluoguxiang just yet (Savor it while you can). The place is not suited for large parties as the tables have no way of getting pushed together, therefore the ambiance is pretty much suited for a quick meal to fill the belly. Service: They...

"For personal experience, I can say that it's very hard to find decent mexican restaurants or bars in China. The food in sand pebbles is definitely more tex-mex than actual mexican, but I thought it was delicious. It was more like authentic tex-mex, and not disgusting mexican food that you normally eat in cheap american bars. The burritos were huge...

"The restaurant is in a trendy part of Beijing with many food choices. Friends who were visiting felt like a Mexican meal and being quite near my home, we chose Sand Pebble Beach. The food was not, in my opinion, good value for money and the main dish that I ordered was rather tasteless. I started with tacos which lacked...

"We headed here the other week for my boyfriend's birthday and our group of 12 all had a great meal. Good for tapas style nibbly foods of nachos and quesadillas, but also the burritos are enormous if you're starving! The red wine wasn't amazing but you can't go wrong with the bottled beers. Service can be a bit slow but...

"We noticed Sand Pebble Beach while walking on this lovely hutong, and decided to go back and try it a couple of weeks later. We were very glad we did, and we've gone back regularly since! Great nachos, great burritos, prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very nice too. Go up on the roof on a nice evening! Even...

"Oh my gosh... the food in this place is to die for. It really is very, very good. So fresh and just absolutely delicious. There is a nice choice on the menu, varying from tacos, to enchiladas, burritos and beyond. The flavor of everything is subtle yet very refreshing. The restaurant itself is a nice little gem in a quaint...

"This is a ""hole in the wall"" Mexican restaurant that really surprised me. I am from California and grew up with good Mexican food and needed to find a fix in Beijing. This place is on a Hutong by the Lama Temple and if you do not know exactly where it is you could easily miss it. The food was...

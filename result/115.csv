"While on tour in China, my wife and I had breakfast (several times) and dinner in Kerry's Kitchen. The style is buffet, the selection is extensive and the presentation is excellent. Eastern and western dishes were available for both breakfast and dinner. We especially enjoyed being served by Archie, who made the experience a personal, welcoming one.","4 из 5 кружков","63074184DF1F00865FA3DE13002F492A","13 марта 2017"
"Just had another amazing breakfast at Kerry's Kitchen in Beijing! I stay here several times a month and I always enjoy the fantastic variety and quality of breakfast food at the buffet.

"Went to Kerry Hotel in Beijing's CDB area for food and drinks. Was impressed by the wide range of asian food at Kerry's kitchen especially the comfort food from Malaysia/Singapore. Will definitely give the Beijing Peking duck at The Horizon the next visit as i heard its the best in Beijing. Also, the bar by the lobby was really packed...

"There is a wide variety of types of food for breakfast including hot and cold dishes. We found that you needed to ask for well done omelettes but that seemed true throughout China. You could have eggs done to order, too. I enjoyed having small portions of many regional dishes as well as salad, noodles, and regular breakfast items. Enjoyed...

"The Breakfast Buffet is awesome at the Kerry's Kitchen. The biggest problem was not where to start, but where to stop as it has something for ""everyone"". Great fresh fruits and juices, excellent breads, and caters to almost every style for breakfast you could ever want. We also had a great lunch there too.","5 из 5 кружков","BD4CDDFDE6A5A7F0B6BCA71572AD0F0F","Отзыв написан 16 августа 2016"

"This restaurant is great IF you like Asian food and IF you want to eat A LOT. It's quite pricey ($108.00 for my husband and I to have dinner with no alcohol), and, unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot of choices of food that we wanted to eat. We would not have chosen this restaurant if we had checked the...

"Big Chinese hotels seem to love buffets which please tour groups and business people on an expense account, I suppose. But the night we tried this buffet was a slow night with maybe only about 15 other diners in a place which could accommodate 100 diners easily. Though the spread has everything from sushi to grill, raw bar, salad bar,...

"We have visited Kerry's kitchen for a quick dinner and it was one of the worst Western meals we had in the last months. First mistake, we ordered from the menu and that was obviously not appreciated by the staff. The bottle of wine we ordered only appeared after a reminder, the ice cooler for the wine appeared in the...

"Kerry kitchen team are service oriented, they are demonstrating their best friendly service to all the guests, trying hard to accommodate guests' needs.

"Typically on my business trips, I will dine at the hotel a few times. One the first visit, I tried the buffet. There is a large variety of food, mainly from different parts of Asia, which I am very familiar with. The cost of the buffet is expensive, but is comparable to many other food choices in that vicinity. -...

"Months ago, the food selection was actually quite decent. It included Chinese, Western and Japanese style cuisines. However, during my more recent visit, the selection of food completely changed. They only include cheap foods that I can simply buy in a nearby grocery store (cereal, milk, fruit, etc.) and took out the foods that are actually worth the price of...

"The restaurant and food appeared attractive. Unfortunatey, the food was quite dried out and old on the buffet. The restaurant was populated with hordes of small children who were totally unsupervised, running and screaming. Most annoying, there were clustered at the dessert bar, including putting fingers in the chocolate fountain, licking them and doing it again, about which the restaurant...

"I enjoyed the breakfast and dinner buffet at the Kerry Kitchen. There was a large selection of foods, including Chinese, Indian, and Western.

"I had dinner here last night, it was amazingly bad. I usually hate writing bad reviews when everyone is happy, but it was so bad, that I am now afraid of going back there for breakfast.

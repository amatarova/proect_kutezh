"Siji Minfu, which literally means people (min) are in happiness (fu) all year round (siji, four seasons of the year), provides the best Beijing Duck with reasonable costs (CNY198 for the whole duck). Other dishes have been modified to better accommodate flavors of people from different parts of the world yet still authentic Chinese food, not some fusion that has lost the spirit of Chinese food. Another thing I need to mention is the service they provide is really of high quality. Because of this, you need to make a reservation (but only before six o'clock if I remember it right, or only for private rooms not tables in the hall), or go there before 5pm, otherwise you will end up waiting for up to 2-3hrs.","5 из 5 кружков","91B8C1E6C2A95D52AD7AFE081A6EC128","14 марта 2017"
"Wir haben etwa 40 Minuten gewartet. Das Restaurant hat ein Wartenummern-System und es lauft alles sehr organisiert. Das Interieur ist gemutlich, traditionell.
Zum Anfang hat mich extrem verargert, dass zwar die Karte unter anderem auf englisch ist, aber die Bedienung kein Wort sprach oder verstand. In China ist das ja nicht ungewohnlich, aber in einem so gut bewerteten Restaurant hatte ich das jetzt erwartet.
Zum Essen hatten wir eine halbe Peking-Ente (2 Personen), die ublichen Beilagen, Pancakes, gebratenen Blumenkohl, Mango- und Lachwurfel auf Teigrollen und frittierte Prawns. Alles war sehr lecker und die Kommunikationsprobleme wert.
Am Ende haben wir inkl. Getranke unter 350 <U+00A5> bezahlt.
Wir kommen wieder.","5 из 5 кружков","4111356B696845B5FAE1DC7E7ABBCDD7","10 марта 2017"
"This is my first experience eating Peking duck, and what a place to do it! It was superb. So was the beef, pork and pepper, kung pao chicken, and strawberry and blueberry drink. All of it was delicious and visually nicely prepared. The duck, was superb. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender. With the various sauces and accompanying ingredients the overall effect was fun, varied, and tasty. And when the bill came, I was pleased that the total was under what I expected.","5 из 5 кружков","A9329FBE98912D86A47C1B8B6C56E037","28 февраля 2017"

"La prima sera a Pechino avevamo appuntamento con degli amici che ci hanno portato in questo locale che e stata (per noi) una sorpresa assoluta tanto da esserci poi tornati l'ultima sera prima di ripartire. Un locale abbastanza caratteristico con un ottimo servizio e che, nonostante fosse affollato (il sabato abbiamo atteso circa 1 ora per sederci) riescono a servirti abbastanza velocemente. La prima sera abbiamo preso un assaggio di antipasti tutti molto buoni, una zuppa di abalon ed una di carne squisite e, soprattutto, l' anatra che e il loro piatto forte (l'abbiamo scoperto la prima sera). Ovviamente com'e loro usanza, l'anatra viene servita con una sorta di sfoglie che vanno riempite con l'anatra stessa e salsa e ortaggi vari che ti portano in piattini appositi (ad ogni commensale il suo piccolo porta vivande). La seconda sera, io e mia moglie, abbiamo pagato il corrispettivo di 22 euro una cena eccellente, ricca con due birre cinesi da mezzo litro ognuna. Da non perdere assolutamente.","5 из 5 кружков","97610A56051430E246BC6170AAA3DCB4","17 февраля 2017"

"The Beijing Duck was well presented and tested great, along with all other dishes we ordered. The wait in line was tedious but had stools available that made it bearable. It does allow for some time to observe locals and their ways. There is an unfortunate part to most traditional restaurants around Wangfujing, the cleanliness is rather poor, and they pay little attention to details. Not a bad choice but a big contrast to unsurpassed Chinese luxury restaurants found in the top class hotels.","3 из 5 кружков","3AD3209352645415971649D82CF04326","17 февраля 2017"
"Как же нам понравилась утра в этой сети ресторанов!
Вкусная, много мяса, отличный набор гарнира! Стоит утра 190, можно взять разные вариации и по другим ценам! Мы еще брали говядину - островата немного, но НЕВЕРОЯТНО мягкая, тает во рту! И рис с яйцом и соевым соусом - это просто вкуснота!
Будьте осторожны с закусками - они могут быть очень острые!

"Ресторан посетили в составе большой экскурсионной группы перед отъездом из Пекина домой, то есть это был заключительный торжественный ужин , посвященный окончанию поездки. В зал вывезли сервировочный столик, на котором официант виртуозно разделал сначала одну утку, а потом еще штук 5 на 108 маленьких кусочков, которые девушки-официантки с народных костюмах разнесли по столикам и показали как эти кусочки на хрустящей кожице нужно завернуть в блинчик, предварительно смазав его специальным сладким соусом и добавив туда наструганный огурец и еще-какую-то зелень, и пожалуйста- ""кушать подано"" для одного из гостей. Блинчик выглядел очень аппетитно, но мы не смогли завернуть свои также красиво. Наша группа радостно фотографировала процесс разделки вожделенной утки, но от поедания ее получили меньшее удовольствие или уток просто на всех не хватило. Ресторан очень симпатичный, яркий, выглядит нарядно и персонал вежливый.","4 из 5 кружков","259E338E0C340C80175A340C1FD5BA57","Отзыв написан 25 января 2017"

"The duck and other dishes were exceptionally delicious but the over 1 hour wait to be seated as they do not take bookings and watching as some customers were treated preferentially and jumped the queue made the experience not so enjoyable.
Arrive early and not ravenous and you will be fine.
Two suggestions for the restaurant would be to (A) serve drinks to waiting patrons (beer, wine etc) they would make more money and have placated us a bit. (B) Have some form of written English explaining the process as no one spoke English.","3 из 5 кружков","06FF9692838187F523B2D8D6C66318BE","Отзыв написан 16 января 2017"

"We visited Siji Minfu on the 17th December. Luckily we got there early at five thirty so there was no need to queue. We ordered Peking roast duck which lived up to its standard, crispy melt in your mouth skin, tender meat and light fluffy pancakes. We ordered some other cheaper vegetable and meat dishes, not their house specialty, but tasty and not too oily nor salty. (This can be a problem with Northern Chinese cooking.) All up dinner for sixteen people was less than 1400 RMB, quite good value really. I would definitely recommend the place.","5 из 5 кружков","4214A6D1F4051159A02671BCE35E3FFF","Отзыв написан 2 января 2017"

"Anatra arrosto alla pechinese squisita e preparata al momento da uno chef vicino al nostro tavolo. Agnello arrosto buonissimo. Prezzi modici. Unico neo: si attende in coda per un oretta, soprattutto se andate tra le 18:00 e le 21:00. Locale frequentato da pechinesi, pochissimi turisti occidentali, il che e gia un ottimo punto di partenza.

"We really enjoyed this dinning experience and enjoyed the peeking duck! This restaurant live up to the reviews and I would recommend. We were advised to arrive before 7pm to get a table which we did. The place gets very busy and the queue was out of the door when we left.
The waiter and waitresses don't speak English as mentioned in the previous reviews and so this make it a little more tricky when I comes to ordering. However the menus have pictures but are sadly missing a description so you will have to take a gamble when ordering. We still really enjoyed the food we got regardless and were pleasantly surprised at what good value it was when we received our bill.

"Upon arrival at our hotel, we decided to head out to dinner and we had marked this restaurant as a candidate. We asked the hotel's lobby if we needed a reservation, but the response was negative.
Since it appeared to be about 10-12 mins walk from our hotel we decided to walk, and we did. It seems to be a safe area.
The restaurant is easy to spot since there is a sign in English.
We had to wait a few mins and we were sitted. Some staff speak enough English to get understood. Language was not sn issue. The menu had the best food photos I have ever seen, and it included the plate names in English.

"We found the food to be quite boring and lacking flavour. The service was average as well. They didn't refill waters or ask if we wanted another beer. The rice came after we had pretty much finished our meat dishes. Also, they don't take any credit card payments, cash only, which was surprising for a nice & modern looking restaurant. We also ended up walking back to our hotel, the cab situation in Beijing is pretty atrocious. None of them speak a word of English & refuse short trips. Anyway, the only reason I mention that in this review is because one of the hostesses tried very hard to find us a cab with no luck. She spent a good 20min trying to help us get a ride back
to our hotel so I did want to mention how kind she was. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.","3 из 5 кружков","97EAC0C67B40FEDDBFB2AA8E08053798","Отзыв написан 7 декабря 2016"
"While in Beijing, the must-eat dishes are Peking duck or a steamboat in this wintry weather. We chose the Peking duck. We waited for an hour for the duck so while waiting we had the veal, sour deep fried pork and green vege. Be prepared to pay about RMB350 for half duck, a meat dish and a veg dish and a Chinese stew.","4 из 5 кружков","C2EA1ECD1354EC891F7413EEFD571316","Отзыв написан 7 декабря 2016"

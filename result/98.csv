"All the hotpot restaurants I've been to before have a single bowl of broth, sometimes split for two different ones, that everyone shares. Here everyone gets their own burner and broth.

"This is a very large Hot Pot Restaurant. Local clientele and very busy. Not a tourist spot but the menu is ok for those of us who are not Mandarin speakers.

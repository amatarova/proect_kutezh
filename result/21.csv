"Located on one of the top floors of the mall, this is a popular place for Dim sum. It is part of a chain, but don't let that keep you away. We ordered very tradition dumplings stuffed with either pork, shrimp or veggies. Add a vegetable side dish and some egg fried rice and you will be happy. There is...

"Having been to the original location in Taiwan, I was very excited to try this branch. I have to say, while a bit more expensive than the dumplings in Taiwan, it is just as good.

"First, here in the states food in the mall is generally of poor quality. Not so in China as the food is very good. Second, it has been my experience that chain restaurants are generally lacking in originality and quality. Not true with this particular restaurant.

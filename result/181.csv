"One of the best BBQ places in Beijing. The brisket plate is great but even better is the brisket burger!","5 из 5 кружков","4BFC6B3CAA8451C544AE009C516186AF","15 марта 2017"
"It was great. Good waiter. Food was very good. Nice portions. Everyone joyed their meal. Even had something for the vegetarian in our group. Nice place to watch a sport event, which was very important to some because Australian open championship was on. Friendly bartender also. I would go again.","4 из 5 кружков","17B42FFDB200CD70A0D1B9DE970F6E75","Отзыв написан 30 января 2017"

"Southern style cooking in the US is a little different then the north. The brisket here melts in your mouth. If you miss southern cooking try their bar-b-que and burgers. They are always on point.","4 из 5 кружков","DD7E79ECBDB4254BD94E59C0AA4268DF","Отзыв написан 31 октября 2016"
"Visit during the October holiday and as we were in Sanlitun area and parked outside we decided to try. We have visited many times over the years, but mainly to the original location. Lunch service was quite busy, but we did not have to wait too long to be served. We ordered ribs, cheese burger and brisket with many sides....

"Was dying for BBQ ribs and Home Plate satisfied my hunger to perfection. The Memphis ribs were my favorite. Sweet and tender. KC ribs were great but a tad too dry for my liking. Ambience was great and service was quick. Highly recommend this place if you need your ribs fix.","5 из 5 кружков","77FAC00579481CDD8BD5C900DB5518F5","Отзыв написан 19 октября 2016"
"Obviously somebody with Missouri ties had a hand in this restaurant. You don't end up with Boulevard beer on tap and Son Volt on the overhead speakers otherwise. We had an exchange of servers mid meal which lead to a lapse in our service. The food was good, but I wish the rib tips were just a bit more tender.","4 из 5 кружков","F1DF147D208D67090A89B18E16DD2F60","Отзыв написан 17 октября 2016"

"Great American BBQ menu! Ribs, brisket, chicken, the works! Food wa great, Service is pretty abysmal! Had to ask for everything, to be waited on, silverware, pretty much self service except for the cooking! When I am in a foreign country, I never expect the residents to speak my language. However, if you have an American themed restaurant, with a...

"I mainly stop by here to pick up a rack of ribs and some brisket or pulled pork on my way home. You really can't beat the dry rub Memphis ribs. But EVERY time I stop by for lunch, it is typical of not below average Beijing service. Inside you have to stand up to wave down the waitresses who...

"You will not go wrong stopping in here for food or beer. I was there on a Friday Night at 8 PM and the place was almost full. By the time I left after dinner it was full. Their BBQ is as good as I have had, I recommend the Brisket. Good selection of beers and friendly efficient service make...

"Tried this place for the first time after living in Beijing for over a year. Wow wished I'd tried it sooner. Brisket and pork was moist and flavorful. No need for BBQ sauce! Looking at other dishes being served I noticed all were of large portions and looked delicious. Owner was friendly and helpful. Some of the staff were more...

"After living in Beijing so long I crave food from home and home plate is always my go to. They have vegetarian options! There are 6 sauces to test out with your burger, fries, fried okra etc! All delicious! The owner is very nice as well and recognizes us only after a few times going.","5 из 5 кружков","6842490B028CAE3677A2F262DD9F3863","Отзыв написан 7 января 2016"
"We are fans of Home Plate since the very first time we went to their location on the northeast of the city. But this one in Sanlintun is by far so much better than the previous one. Way more room for sitting without any kind of rush or other people's back near to yours. Food is as tasty as in...

"I have been living in China for several years and have often been disappointed when ordering a meat dish but not at this place. For the two of us we ordered the nachos, the quesadilla and a mixed meat plate to share. The portions were bigger than we expected. The quesadilla filled with chicken was perfect. The nachos were also...

"I visited Home Plate for dinner with my wife. I had a burger and she had brisket. The burger was delicious, juicey and massive. The brisket was not dried out, as is frequently the case, but succulent and tasty. They have an excellent selection of beers, ales, cocktails and hard drinks as well as soft drinks. Service was prompt and...

"There are two of these in Beijing, this is the second, and newest opening of this restaurant. Located across from Sanlitun Village, and just down the street, and off the main street. It might be hard to find the first time. But, well worth the effort. They have huge smokers out side, as all is smoked there on site. You...

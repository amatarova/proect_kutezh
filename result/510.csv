"Not the cheapest place to eat in Beijing or in this area, but it was excellent food. The food is prepared in front of you - providing both entertainment and quality assurance.

"Not easy to find but well worth it when you get there. Excellent Japanese kitchen and atmosphere. The sushi and sashimi is quite expensive but almost every other Japanese dish on the menu are cheap. Highly recommended when you want something else than Chinese food when in Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","0799CB42683BA7C0E45156F3E75068F0","Отзыв написан 14 октября 2013"

"if u're bored eating chinese food, why not try some japanese here. it's around 5mins walk from sofitel. small and cosy place to eat, sat infront of the counter and u can see them make the sushi roll. all the waiters know how to speak japanese, so its quite refreshing to be able to talk to them not in mandarin.","5 из 5 кружков","C1B79584566DAE8065681E12685BB95C","Отзыв написан 17 октября 2012"

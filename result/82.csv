"I arranged this meal after a visit to the forbidden city. My children enjoyed the experience as there was a performance that came with the meal. The meal was relatively more expensive than your regular Beijing restaurant, so be prepared. But what is sure is that the locals find this THE place for special occasions such as birthdays. So I...

Its the former home of a nobleman, complete with elaborate courtyard and pond, turned into a restaurant serving traditional court dishes in private dinning rooms spread around the complex. The staff wears costumes from the last dynasty. The food was good but...

"A fun treat in the city's Haidan district, this restaurant dresses servers in costumes from the Qing dynasty. The decor also reflects that era, although the historically accurate stone steps in the garden area can be a trifle tricky to negotiate in the dark. Despite the formal dress of the servers, the atmosphere was relaxed and informal. We enjoyed dining...

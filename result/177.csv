"We had lunch with locals and westerners. Found this restaurant expensive for what you got. The service was horrible, all the wait staff seemed confused. The seats around the round tables were wooden stools/ no back, therefore got really uncomfortable after a while. This restaurant also had no bathrooms, you had to exit and find your way around a mall...

"Every time we're in Beijing we never fail to eat here.

The noodles were not bad according fo my husband. I didn't quite like the spare ribs and chicken gizzard i ordered...

"Shame it's on the fourth floor of a dept store. If it was in a stand alone building it would be an absolute fav for me to bring foreign guests to. But don't let the store location put you off. Once inside you are transported to old Nanjing, the cheery welcoming shouts from the old men at the door right...

"Menu is in English for many items, not all. We had chicken, duck, cold noodles with shrimp paste and some dumplings. Beer was warm but we didn't expect otherwise. No Tsingdao tonight, so we had the Chinese version of Budweiser.","4 из 5 кружков","1340C927720C8FD45B8341BAF4F68444","Отзыв написан 9 апреля 2016"
"Date: Jan 2016 Number of Guests: 2 Pricing: $8-10/person Review: DaPai Dang is our go-to resto whenever we're in the Sanlitun area, it's the default place to go when we can't think of anywhere else to go. Pricing is very reasonable, you can go there for a bowl of noodles for $3 or if you're a group, there's a wide...

"A friend had told us about the restaurants at Shimao Plaza, so we tried it out earlier this month, to have dinner with a friend. We made a round and finally entered the Wing Cafe. The reception was friendly and helpful and the decoration gave an intimate impression, so we decided to have a try. The menu was a real...

"We came here one night as it was close to the Sanlitun area, my Google maps app was showing this as a highly rated restaurant nearby. The food was delicious and prices were very reasonable. Service was good, but we were there close to closing time a few of the dishes we wanted were not available.","5 из 5 кружков","29911D7DA81404E977A455958B60B404","Отзыв написан 21 октября 2015"

"The restaurant is located on the 6th floor of the Jinbaotower. So try the seats next to the windows, you will have a magnificent view. About the food, it was good but the menu was a little bit poor.. I was expecting more main thai dish as different kind of Tom Yum/pad thai. The price is about 168RMB per dish","3 из 5 кружков","C276E0CB56BB69D7A56194B5CE6FFBAE","Отзыв написан 14 декабря 2016"
"This is probably the most Thai taste you can get in Beijing. For a Thai like me, I have to admit they did a great job keeping the authentic Thai taste despite ingredients' limitation. Would recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food.","4 из 5 кружков","C79FE4F994F5B69339E62F70EACDFEAB","Отзыв написан 8 октября 2016"
"The dishes here are authentic and very delicious. The setting is nice and you can ask to be seated by the window so you can see the city skyline. Service is the greatest. Highly recommended.","5 из 5 кружков","2E1DD600CE87C17B3C9F62743FDE37E0","Отзыв написан 25 сентября 2016"
"A definite must if you are a fan of Thai food. Beautifully presented, tasted delicious and the service was excellent. Location across the road from The Regent hotel in a premium shopping mall. But don't let that put you off as has its own standalone site beautifully decorated.","5 из 5 кружков","8A638D58D7BF4C1FD0AE272E4EA41409","Отзыв написан 30 августа 2016"

"I had a lunch over the weekend in Patara and must say it was perfect! The green chicken Curry was served in the young coconut – both presentation and taste were terrific.

"Great starters and Main Dish. Large variety Good service, possibly a little too keen to take our order - but I prefer that than being very difficult to get service staff attention. Tom Yum Soup - excellent Scallop starters - great dressing, but the scallops were probably overcooked - but dressing was worth it","5 из 5 кружков","3E2E5C6AF3F60387462EC45DE8C8EB23","Отзыв написан 31 декабря 2014"

"This restaurant is located close to the hotel we stayed in. The staff were friendly and attentive. Overall the food tasted great. However it was slightly disappointing that my starter arrived after my partner's main was served and that my main arrived almost at the same time. The bill was quite steep if compared to other places in Beijing, but...

"After a week in Beijing, we were keen on Asian food, but something with a different taste and some spice. We were staying at the Park Plaza hotel, and stumbled across Patara whilst exploring Jinbao Place, which is perhaps 200m away from the hotel. What a fantastic find. The food is excellent!!! The best meal that we had in Beijing...

"So I was wondering why were the burger patties not as hot as any regular burger restaurant, even though I was seated close to the kitchen... It turns out that most burgers share the same exact beef patty, and AFTER they are done grilling the party they start adding other things such as onions and tomatoes to make the classic...

"The first time we had dinner at Let's Burger was a few years back and we remembered it was great but pricey! This second time, we noticed that they revised the menu. Some of the burgers, like the Sirloin burger, were still pricey (around RMB200+), but some others are below RMB100. We had a fish burger, the crispy cheeseburger, green...

"Excellent dishes, and very innovative for the current offer in Beijing. Let's Burger is not for the fainted of heart (portions are very decent) or empty wallets (yes, a little expensive for eating burgers). Products are very well prepared, and you pay for what you receive. Recommended weekend meals, couples and friends!","4 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 20 марта 2016"
"They really have a nice choice of various burgers with excellent buns , also in various makes. We have been now there for 2nd time and we have not been disappointed. Especially my Burger came with Avocado. And it was ripe to the point. Coz sometimes its not easy to use Avocado at the right moment. Getting already soft, but...

"This is a chain that includes some other ""Let's xxxx"" restaurants. Been here probably 4 or 5 times. This place has the best burgers in Sanlitun. Maybe the best in Beijing. The burgers are fairly pricy for Beijing. About 15 to 22 dollars US. Lots of creative combinations for burgers. Many of them stack too high to get your mouth...

"I am a serious burger lover. I’ve been in Beijing for 3 months, and I’ve been to 8 or 9 burger joints so far. This is definitely the best one. The burgers are tender and juicy, but not greasy. I’ve had 4 of their burgers, each one entirely satisfying. On the downside, you have to buy your fries at an...

"Just right! Juicy beef patty, soft buns, fresh vegetable and specialty sauce. RMB75 - over RMB100, it doesn't come cheap but it is very yummy. Wish they have draft beer and not just bottled beers that wasn't cold enough for my liking. The chips are tasty too but don't think it is the best in Beijing yet.","4 из 5 кружков","0AD2A2E6AB242E82B3FD6E01C998EA87","Отзыв написан 19 июля 2014"

"My wife and I had veggie burgers--portobello mushrooms, a potato patty, fresh veggies and an interesting mayonnaise-based sauce--and they were delicious. The french fries--super thick and tender--were fine. And the coffee was strong and delicious. On the expensive side…but this is Sanlitun, so you expect it. Service was friendly, and Derek, the owner/manager, is friendly and urbane. They also serve...

They use Angus beef and organic veggies. The burger is sooooo tender and juicy! That's why it's a little pricey, you...

"We were very excited to get another burger option in Shunyi when the new location opened, and it was deeply disappointing. My burger, though requested medium well, was completely raw (red, crumbly and dripping) in the center, the cheese balls were overcooked, the mushroom appatizer was mediocre, and it was all extrememly expensive. I'll stick with Blue Frog next time.","2 из 5 кружков","C07E88D6991970DC8DCCD43272E3A941","Отзыв написан 25 марта 2012"

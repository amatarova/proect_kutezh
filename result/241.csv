"This little restaurant I found by accident by strolling through the Hutong. Very tasty design space and food. Definitely a place for couples. As they change the menu every month, it'll be always a nice surprise what tastes you can explore.","5 из 5 кружков","D6A5B3F2FAE715DFE875E9994119AC1A","Отзыв написан 25 ноября 2016"
"We had been to see the Lama and Confucius Temples and were heading back at dusk to Yonghegong station (probably the nearest despite what TripAdvisor says) when my wife took a fancy to explore an attractively lit hutong, and after a craft beer or two we decided to eat at Chi. Good decision. Not prepossessing from the outside, the inside...

"I came here after visiting the nearby Lama Temple. I had the set lunch of chickpea soup, chicken and couscous ending with strawberry mousse. I washed it down with a beer. All very tasty and filling.

"This restaurant was a lovely find in Beijing! We arrived quite late & were the last customers but the staff was wonderful, the restaurant itself was cosy & a lovely space & the food of course was great. I definitely recommend Chi ! Also the hutong it's in was charming to walk around.","4 из 5 кружков","29917662E7F3A791A60B3AD4226AD570","Отзыв написан 10 апреля 2016"
"Excellent food. Guests have a choice of either a seafood or a meat set menu - the interpretation is loose as I had a salmon course in the meat menu, although I'm sure you can change it to meat if you prefer. Prices very reasonable, high quality food, friendly staff who speak English. A definite plus!","5 из 5 кружков","B91A5FCB72E021617BB949770EE05FF9","Отзыв написан 24 января 2016"

"We had soups for starter that were very tasty and fresh. Our main courses were also very good couscous and salmon bagels and the dessert was just perfect to finish this lovely lunch laying on the sun outside. Will definitely come back to try the others dishes !","4 из 5 кружков","74D81A2EFF428D8606128CF00C2FBB63","Отзыв написан 2 ноября 2015"
"A good place for casual meals of 2-3 peoples. The location is in Wudaoying Hu tong which is good for shopping and eating. Only set menu is available but the restaurant will ask if you have anything don't like at the ordering.","4 из 5 кружков","B998F605CA26E46A9C3A1007C87295E3","Отзыв написан 29 августа 2015"
"Very nice place with trends set meny, located near the Hutong area in Beijing in a street with many other restaurant. Difficult to get table - you need to pre-book many days Specially the dessert with Matcha Tea Lava Cake was special and something new","4 из 5 кружков","413E02BCD5D6BB271243578BB93372D4","Отзыв написан 5 октября 2014"

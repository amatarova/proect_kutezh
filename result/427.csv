"The restaurant was quite busy and we had to wait to get a table. We got lucky with the table as it was quite close to the performance. Personally i think the Peking Duck is an acquired taste as i wasn't particularly fond of it. The rest of the food was decent. Overall, it was ok, can be skipped.","3 из 5 кружков","5394DF3FB1C60642E2152BE7E43D9912","Отзыв написан 17 августа 2016"
"The restaurant here is in a busy spot on a lake which looked very good for taking a boat out. The food was decent enough, usual noodles and rice with duck and other meats. In the background was a traditional dance and show which was a little weak but ok.","3 из 5 кружков","14A649064816048B4048AF0DC7C08441","Отзыв написан 4 августа 2016"
"Place is nice but total junk basic food. You can't eat much better elsewhere. I don't think this lake area is worth to come visit...just really basic nothing impressive. Spend your time at the summer palace much better!","1 из 5 кружков","7E9B10C66D7933DD05D70439035EBB54","Отзыв написан 24 июля 2016"
"Staff are pretty impatient and a bit rude when you do not accept their recommendations. Duck is mediocre and they served the pancake crepe well before duck was served. Result: the crepe hardened into a tasteless heap. Sauce for duck was too salty and over powered everything.","3 из 5 кружков","C0A4A017A66053A4443B6E78256405E6","Отзыв написан 6 июня 2016"
"The restaurant seems a bit dated; there was a broken chair at our table that we had to switch out. They did not offer things like sparkling water, or dark beer for patrons. But the duck was very good and so were all the other dishes that we tried. After you eat the meat, you can have your duck bones...

"We came for an early dinner about 4pm so there was no line up. We got the Beijing duck, pancakes, condiments, mustard duck webs, duck spring rolls, noodles, and duck intestine dish. Duck spring rolls were kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. This place was very warm. We were sitting the balcony overlooking the main dining room. Not...

"Firstly, dont go by the Tripadvisor map marker, its completely off. As other reviewers have stated, its over a mile away at Lotus Market. Anyway- Kinda tasteless duck in a boring and drab setting. Service was attentive, but pretty weird vibe there, perhaps because I was solo and had one guy hovering over my shoulder the whole time. It was...

"Even though the wait was long, I really really enjoyed the performance (magic, shadow puppets, masks, acrobatics, etc.) If I have important business partners, parents or just want to have a unique Beijing experience, I would sacrifice an hour of the wait time and eat here.","5 из 5 кружков","FEBB850D682B6D69887A242815EB683D","Отзыв написан 22 марта 2016"
"This place was recommended to me by two different locals. The classic duck dish is served as a DIY wrap with cucumber, spring onion and soy. The duck had a fair bit less flavour than I'm used to. The wrap was bland of course but, combined with the soy, the duck's flavour was overwhelmed and I was underwhelmed. Tried the...

"We went as a tour group & were disappointed with the Peking Duck but impressed with the large choice of other dishes. The duck was rather tasteless & the pancakes were worse! I've had far better in other restaurants & yet this place is supposedly famous for it! It was fun to watch the chefs cooking the ducks & the...

"The location makers on trip advisor in Beijing are terrible!! Go to Qianhai lake, walk along the lotus market and look for the big duck. Go in and down to -1 level get a ticket and if no tables are available they will tell you when to return. Duck was delicious but this is definitely a tourist thing to do!...

"Enjoy one of the best delicacies if Beijing's local kitchen: Peking Duck. Generally speaking, a very good place to enjoy Chinese food. Good dishes (both veggies and meats), and the late afternoon show is quite entertaining too. Recommended for first time visitors.","4 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 20 мая 2015"
"Highly recommended for everyone who visits Beijing. We went there with a group of seven and everyone was very satisfied with the quality of the food and of course duck! Pros: Beautifully roasted, succulent duck skin and meat. A good variety of food was also available to enjoy with Peking Duck. Ducks were roasted in a traditional way which enhanced...

"My fiancee and I agreed you go here so you can say you went. Duck is amazing, yes, but so was the duck we ate in Taiyuan. However, this was probably twice the cost for half the duck. Small plate was +230RMB, pot of green tea was 80RMB, and the soup tasted like it was made from duck grease and...

"We actually went (with our tour group) to the Hepingmen location of this small chain. The restaurant is HUGE, with something like six floors of kitchen and serving area. Our group had a pre-set menu which included, well, duck, duck, and more duck. Since I love duck, I was happy; my daughter wasn't so much. But the Peking Duck, which...

"Big it definitely is but definitely not the best Beijing duck we've tasted.. Maybe because there are just too many chefs and too many customers; it becomes very mass-cooked without much personal touch or taste...","3 из 5 кружков","5EE03535934637769D19B8B97F8807E8","Отзыв написан 31 июля 2014"

"Come here and eat just the Peking duck. It is more than enough. If you have had Peking duck outside china in the past, this is still a must. The duck is so different. You can't see the layer of fat. It's just skin and meat. Most importantly, it taste soo yummy!! The duck soup they served you after is...

The vast majority of customers were local with only one or two westerners dotted throughout the large room. A major plus for me was the entertainment which included acrobats, dancers and a chinese puppet show. (This is a regular event...

"My wife and I had visited this restaurant once while living in Beijing for the 2008 Olympic Games and vowed we'd come back as soon as we could. Well it was 8 years before we found ourselves back in Beijing for an 8 hour layover and we knew we'd have to make the effort to attend. Since we had a...

"If you've ever wanted to feel like royalty, this is the place to eat. The restaurant has a lush courtyard feel to it, with plush seating and burning incense. The waiters, dressed as Buddhist monks (which I think they are), bow to you and accompany you everywhere - as I left the bathroom one waiter ran from down a hall...

"Dinning at the Pure lotus restaurant is a memorable experience. The place and of course the food was simply impressive, from the imaginative serving to the pure flavors of amazing ingredients which created perfect dishes. The staff was incredibly nice, and helpful. I really liked the idea of fixed, preset menu, which is nicely balanced and changes monthly, so next...

"A Fine dining restaurant, but amazing service and the most beautiful decor i have seen in a Chinese restaurant. A great staff and extremely humble.

"Being vegetarians, my husband and I were recommended this place by the concierge at our hotel in Beijing. The decor was impressive. The waiter suggested, rather strongly insisted that we take their special menu which was priced at 2000 RMB per person. We opted out and chose few dishes from the a la carte menu. The portion sizes were obscenely...

"Loved the decor of the place. Really romantic; they even have a table called princess quarter or something which is gorgeous. It's a vegan restaurant that does everything meat flavoured, which a vegan can't otherwise taste. Huge huge menu, lots of variety and everything unique. The service was excellent. Staff was very friendly, helpful and paid good attention to details....

"I am not a vegetarian. Pure Lotus, even by world class standards, and definitely by ""Vegetarian"" standards is very expensive - more akin to a 3 star Michelin Sushi restaurant. Think $$$$.

"I have been visiting this restaurant since 2005 and the prices have risen to the point that this restaurant's main motivation is greed, rather than serving the customer.

However I was nearly fainted upon settlement of bill. I can't expect Vegetarian dinner for 5pax could cost me Rmb 4000.

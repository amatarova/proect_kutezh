"We thoroughly enjoyed a lunch here after meandering the shops in the mall. It was quiet, elegant, the service was terrific, and the food was delicious and much needed when our western pallet needed a small break from Chinese food. There is Wifi and we watched other diners eat amazing high teas ... but we were extremely happy with our...

"We've ordered a Wellington Beef platter for 2. It cost 300 RMB. The quality was good, not too raw and well presented dish. Taste was good, not exceptional. Service was efficient and had limited English skills.","3 из 5 кружков","7A9C8C0B5801871EC63044F7D557FAA9","Отзыв написан 20 января 2017"

"Transported to Paris with great ambiance and good food. Something for every palate. Savory and sweet, meat or seafood, tea or coffee, bier or champagne. Give yourself a treat after enjoying the art at this interesting mall if you are not in a shopping mood.","4 из 5 кружков","007492FD28B65DFAED4B6DA2B5CA75E0","Отзыв написан 10 января 2017"

"Been there after a business meeting, it was probably too early for the staff who didn't seem to be well woken up. (Probably they should drink more coffee) I ordered a croissant and an espresso at first by the set. After 20 mins a waiter came to see me and told me :no small croissant, ok why not so I...

"Pleasant place to dine within an upscale mall, one of the more continental places to eat, most of the others are Asian cuisine.","5 из 5 кружков","C52B7EF0B6CF5074C50139C08F32377E","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2016"
"This was a surprising find in the mall contacted to the Hotel Eclat. A little French place that once your sitting doesn't feel like a mall. Great service, we ended up going there 3 times, and really good salads!","4 из 5 кружков","14B41A8009F41CD163F63BB315B0955A","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2016"

"Cafe Flo opened in July 2016 in Sanlitun, we read a review and decided to give it a try. A great decision ! A French themed cafe, offering breakfast, brunch, afternoon tea and dinner. We went for dinner and were very impressed with the decor, the service and the food. The restaurant was busy at 7.00pm on Saturday evening, we...

"Well located in the business heart of Beijing with very arty Enviroment in Parkview Green Plaza. Great atmosphere and good service. Excellent value for afternoon tea after a good walk to admire the Daly and other daring art works of Parkview Green! Nearby Opera is one of the best Italian restaurant in town.","4 из 5 кружков","10BB15BDB3D7384F388A72F58887A558","Отзыв написан 26 июля 2016"

"We like the mall Parkview Green, and we'd tried Asian restaurants in this mall and we decided to try a western one this time. We had some light lunch items, salad and spaghetti. They taste good but not the wow type. We enjoyed the relax environment.","3 из 5 кружков","B9C8D33D9A74C80271B35AD1F25A3CD4","Отзыв написан 13 июля 2016"
"The expectations due to the pricing and location were high. French bistro styling menu in French, English and Chinese. That was the only positive! Service was a disaster! No word English! Totally incompetent and slow! Food was mediocre! Avoid it! Don't get blinded by the nice location.","2 из 5 кружков","AA31ADC2427FC276017645833F604966","Отзыв написан 9 июля 2016"

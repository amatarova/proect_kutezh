"The restaurant was recommend to us by an expat friend of mine. It serves amazing fusion japanese-mediterreanean food (fish aqua pazza, vegetables bagna cauda with creamy peanut sauce, beef tendon with wine&miso...) with excellent wine and jazz music. As a couple it was just the perfect date, we went out of the restaurant in love, light-headed and happy.","5 из 5 кружков","D340E10E46970C10F14542110543437B","Отзыв написан 3 ноября 2016"

"I've tried the other Thai restaurant, but this restaurant served the best food ever. I've tried the pineapple fried rice, chicken curry (not spicy), and the other I totally forgot what's the name. The hospitality is pretty good. Rice not free (just fyi).","5 из 5 кружков","237DC91B0F59904941ACCE19CCD080F5","Отзыв написан 31 июля 2016"
"The Very Siam (<U+66B9><U+7F57><U+6CF0>)I have been to is located diagonally opposite the Yuyang Hotel (<U+6E14><U+9633><U+996D><U+5E97>)address is <U+65B0><U+6E90><U+897F><U+91CC><U+4E1C><U+8857><U+7532>10<U+53F7> <U+65B0><U+6E90><U+897F><U+91CC><U+793E><U+533A>.

If you want to give it a try without dipping into your pocket, go during...

"Ordered the Tom Yam there and it's delicious, it's one of the best Tom Yam I've eaten. Portion is just the right size not too big and not too small.

"Very Siam ( the one in front of Yuyang hotel <U+6E14><U+9633><U+996D><U+5E97> in Xindonglu) is a nice, quiet place to enjoy some Thai food. the food selection is quite good, and the quality too. watch out for the mild spicy (as they said it) it's not quite mild, if you don't like spicy that much, then I suggest to ask not...

"Vey Siam is Very Good, Some of us from the office went here for a quick bit and we were in for a treat. This mainly northern Thai kitchen was well cooked, spicy and exquisite in a good blend.

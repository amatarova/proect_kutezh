"The Duck was excellent. It's authentically prepared in a wood oven, crispy skin, moist meat, with the usual scallion, cuke, and sweet bean sauce. It's a wonderful meal and Wangfujing does it better than most. The restaurant is very noisy, it's not a good place if you want to talk with anyone other than the person sited next to you.","5 из 5 кружков","DF06A03584DEAF3976A6B5C312BB2A3F","14 марта 2017"
"All Duck lovers, as I have tasted it in Montreal, London, New York, Jakarta, and other, Beijing is the place of the duck. You can choose their set menu, and do try their Chinese Wine, its up to 55% alcohol, and its Vodka like, but they call it Wine.","5 из 5 кружков","20141EC8DBDBFE1F5E539A3243910E04","Отзыв написан 18 мая 2016"

"So we went to this restaurant to try the world famous Beijing duck. We had two Chinese speaking friends with us but even they absolutely hated the service there. While the food was great our server was trying to make us order more than we needed, was slow with taking our order and didn`t really take care of us.","3 из 5 кружков","F5314F187E0B5FC602C18222E4EC8915","Отзыв написан 8 января 2016"
"Pretty good duck, but other dishes are just so so. I feel even the duck can be NOT fresh sometimes. Definitely not what it was years ago. But then again what is in China? The location is very nice though.","4 из 5 кружков","FBBAEC6FC65C2ABBDDE58C692A5ACACA","Отзыв написан 21 декабря 2015"
"After a wonderful walking tour of the Forbidden City we came to this restaurant to enjoy some Peking Duck. The Peking Duck was divine as were the many other dishes. Service was very good and food plentiful. No one walked away hungry.","4 из 5 кружков","B987D2BD25E82CE994C7012E8FBFBDD7","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2015"

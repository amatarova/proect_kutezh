"Extensive menu, delicious food. Was surprised to learn that this is actually a chain restaurant. Never would have guessed based on the quality of the food. Service with a smile","4 из 5 кружков","6C64746682F69CA5A6CB56213D52718D","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"
"This place is very near to our office in Beijing. It was quite hot during the noon but once you get inside you can get cozy. The restaurant is always crowded so better to book the table in advance. Since I am a vegetarian the choice of food was limited so I tried their vegetarian Pizza. This is not quite...

"This is a really great Italian restaurant. There are several branches in areas of Beijing where foreigners live and work. This branch is very close to a lot of hotels. But it is the hardest to find. One morning I walked around the Guomao area with this app showing the Chinese translation to taxi drivers, delivery people, hotel concierges, natives...

"It was a dark and stormy night. It was also a stormy day spent touring around in the rain. No one wanted to go out again once we got back to the hotel. The kids were being adventurous eaters all trip but wanted a little comfort food as well. Concierge recommended this place to deliver. Pizza was great, fast, and...

"For awhile as we were adjusting to life in Beijing, we would order Annie's once a week. It was affordable, good, and consistent. So often in Beijing, you can enjoy a dish and go back and it doesn't taste the same. But Annie's is consistently good. Worth a try.","5 из 5 кружков","B91D9132A7FD651AE8228357D8DC08CB","Отзыв написан 1 января 2016"

"This pizza was great! It was definitely a shock for me to think that the pizza would be any good in China, but it was probably the best pesto pizza ever. DEFINITELY get the pesto pizza. It was amazing. We loved it so much, we ate here 3 times.","5 из 5 кружков","ACBE80FF846CB4D6DA5C762E5DC3283A","Отзыв написан 15 сентября 2015"
"As a vegetarian looking for decent restaurant in Beijing CBD, stumbled upon Annie's. Loved the place instantly. Very American cafe feel. Lively music, great service, very friendly staff. Food was delicious. Brilliant veggie pastas and pizzas. Very very affordable. I give it a 5 star !! Highly recommend for anyone looking for Italian/Vegetarian food. They have chain across the city....

"I've eaten here several times in the past year and never once been disappointed. The food is excellent, especially for the price, and the staff is courteous and well trained. The head cook, Marco, is passionate about getting the best ingredients and seeing to it that guests are satisfied. Even the artwork on the walls is nice. One really gets...

"I had maybe 40 pizzas from this place. They were all made from parma ham, cheese and not much else. It was always fantastic. Delivery was within 20 minutes every time. Perfect after a long day, especially with a bottle of their prosecco. I had no trouble getting my order right, even without speaking Chinese. Also perfect after a long...

"I've eaten here three times over three years and the last time was July, 2014. Pizza, pasta, dessert and wine were all very good even compared to American restaurants. Even with a bottle of wine, the entire meal was a great price. I was actually shocked it didn't cost more. The restaurant was clean inside and well decorated. The staff...

"Enjoyed eating Italian food and they even delivered to our hotel room across the street to our Ascot Hotel. Good pizza, pasta and salads too. Prices were very reasonable too. We ended up eating different food from this restaurant 3 nights in a row as we did not feel like going out.","5 из 5 кружков","B113E1D99976C96C5992003EAD0119CC","Отзыв написан 15 марта 2014"

"I stayed at Ascott, across the road, with my family. While my kids eat ""Asian"" food, when they craved a ""western"" fix and after a days touring, with Chinese food, Annie's hit the mark. out of 4 nights, we ate there 3 dinners, mostly due to convenience, BUT the food was reasonable. The service was good. I travel a lot...

"I love the pumpkin soup here! The pizza is kind of fatty though, it's more american than Italian. The price is the same as many other pizza places in Beijing. This place is a more family oriented delivery pizza place. Summary- Bring your family here Delivery till 1030 pm starting from 1030 am","5 из 5 кружков","39FA2D109EDF20C3783C3A8BF465EFDF","Отзыв написан 14 сентября 2013"
"My husband and I went to the Annie's lido branch...twice in fact! The food was great. Fresh, authentic, tasty and well priced. The service was refreshingly good ( we live in Qingdao often the service is sooooon bad in restaurants it puts me off going out) if you are near an Annie's and fancy some good quality/ solid western cooking......

"OK, may be not everything is better, for example, there is no truffle, no Kobe steak, no lobster, or even foie gras on top of pizzas; but the cooking is solid with authentic Italian flavour, the service cordial, and the decor comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised that one can find such good Italian food in a chain restaurant in China...

"Eaten at Annie's 4 times within one week, as we stayed at a nearby hotel. The menu is very diverse, from classic Italian pastas and risottos, great soups, salads, seafood, and steak. Plus, the kids get to make their own mini pizzas as complimentary starters. Staff speaks English well and is very helpful. A great place for dinner!","5 из 5 кружков","B66337203532D8BBBC4C262CA3CCD2F0","Отзыв написан 19 декабря 2012"

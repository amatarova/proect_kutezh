"Cenato una sera, arriviamo alle 20 e scopriamo che il ristorante chiude alle 21....ci sbrighiamo ad ordinare con un po di difficolta per farsi capire in quanto il personale non parla Inglese e questo purtroppo e un punto a sfavore ma grazie al menu con le foto ci si fa capire.... ordiniamo dei gamberi fritti e glassati eccezionali del pollo piccante riso gamberi e verdure e dei bocconcini di manzo con del cardo in agrodolce...il cibo e veramente buono. Prezzo un po sopra la media secondo me. Comunque ristorante consigliato per una buona cena.","4 из 5 кружков","048746D24CF0BC0B8F06A419F8ED860C","11 февраля 2017"

Nonostante tutto, il cibo e stato decisamente fantastico.
Da segnalare l'anatra alla Pechinese, incredibile!

"Although not in the hutongs or the old town beijing, this restaurant still delivers good Beijing style food with a nice ambiance. Being a Beijing native, I especially enjoy the Sesame Paste Pancake (a snack most Beijingers grew up with). Every course tasted great. Love the ambiance and bird calling. Other impressive dishes include pear soup and simple stir-fried cabbage. It's the simple food done excellent that is sometimes most difficult to achieve and this restaurant certainly did. On the downside, it is a bit noisy which is very common in Chinese especially Beijing restaurant.

"Thanks to TA for this find close to our hotel (Fairmont Beijing). I printed the information about the restaurant before leaving home and showed it to the concierge for directions, when she smiled we knew it was good. We walked about 3 blocks to the location but still couldn't identify the restaurant without help. -The restaurant has 2 red lanterns in front.

We arrived at 5, just when the restaurant opened for dinner and were immediately seated. The menu book with photos made ordering easy. The 3 of us ordered fried shrimp, spicy chicken with garlic and walnuts, special beef with honey and water chestnuts, mixed vegetables, and steamed rice, along with 2 beers and a coke. The food was delicious! Our bill was 350 yuan - about $50 US.

The restaurant was full when we left.","5 из 5 кружков","70EAA8886802C81F0218C3374316ACCA","Отзыв написан 11 сентября 2016"

"This is near the Silk Market - behind the Samsung Building. It's not hard to find on Baidu Map.

Easily one of the nicest places I ate at during my month in Beijing. The food is simply delicious and the atmosphere is lovely. The service is also excellent. So that's a wonderful combination of taste, atmosphere and service. They will also ask you about allergies and MSG etc.

Yes, it's more expensive than your average restaurant, but it's also one of the nicest.","5 из 5 кружков","8F9F6A36BDB45FD60282973C54EAC4B5","Отзыв написан 23 августа 2016"
"We visited this place during our holiday. The restaurant is a very nice place. We had our table at the roofbalcony. Staff does not speak english, but they try to understand you. Food was delicious, the duck was strange ( not prepared as the original peking duck) but tasted very well.","4 из 5 кружков","8C634939F33C456557AD250BDE17F119","Отзыв написан 17 августа 2016"
"I've traveled extensively through China. I really appreciate a clean restaurant. From the moment we walked in, I knew this restaurant was clean. The tables were beautifully set, the decor was beautiful, the windows were clear, even the bathrooms were pretty and clean!
Our table was set with a sealed wet cloth to wash our hands. The menu was a book with photos of the food. Even the food was beautifully displayed. Check out the dumpling photo. Our food was delicious. I loved the sticky rice sticks and the shrimp was delicious. Unfortunately venison wasn't in season.","5 из 5 кружков","E28D7342567BD22F5CC7F9ED3C5C549E","Отзыв написан 2 августа 2016"
"Went there a few days ago with a group of four. It seems to slightly up scale Chinese place - though still very in-expensive for Europeans (120 CNY-ish per person)

The food was good, spicy but nothing fancy. The waiters where overall friendly but the place is busy. We tried to get a reservation but got on waiting list from which we got a seat 20 minutes after arrival","4 из 5 кружков","3F63147941C2C47C6572E4B9E1E16F87","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2016"
"Food is very nice, but most of the dishes are friend - for lovers of such food this is a great place! Of course, make sure to try:
(1) the shrimps
(2) the duck - it is prepared in a different way than Beijing duck so it is quite interesting

The atmosphere is great - very nice and old traditional house, personnel is friendly. English is barely existent as in most of the places.

The restaurant is located behing the LG Towers on Yonganli - around it there are also few other very good restaurants!","4 из 5 кружков","05649E3947E67E23F008B4B1EE1FEF17","Отзыв написан 3 июля 2016"
"My family and I ate dinner at this restaurant while in Beijing. We had never had Manchurian food before and loved all the dishes we sampled - great flavours and presentation. One suggestion to other diners...make sure you order a side dish of rice to counteract the spicy dishes. Loved the atmosphere. We were upstairs on the ""balcony"" looking down at the main floor. Highly recommended. Easy to find on Google maps.","5 из 5 кружков","350D1A249AF69E141015C2E4087D41AD","Отзыв написан 13 июня 2016"
"Went on a Sunday night... Did not do any bookings, but was lucky to get a table within 10 mins. The Lamb ribs were amazing. So were the other dishes. Prices are affordable and service attentive. Portions are good for 2-3 pax (assuming you order 3-4 dishes). The ambiance is old world and nostalgic. The brids cry/song from time to time further liven up the foot and atmosphere.","4 из 5 кружков","5562CEDF19CEC2500569A94CAA48D57C","Отзыв написан 6 июня 2016"
"We ate here during our recent trip to Beijing and were delighted with our choice. The restaurant is quite large and on Saturday night, as we left around 9.00pm, people were queuing for a table; please note that you cannot make a reservation. The cuisine is Manchurian, a first for us. We really enjoyed our prawns with lychee; stir-fried greens; and beef and mushroom accompanied by some Yanjing beer. The staff, who speak very little English, were friendly and helpful.","4 из 5 кружков","0707C5D5A9E4423D29E5289AB18CD01E","Отзыв написан 24 апреля 2016"
"This is a Manchurian restaurant. We went there around lunch time and our tour guide told us their shrimp is very famous. It was excellent and we ordered 2 plates for the 9 of us. We order other dishes including deer meat and pork with dates on top. The pork is too fatty for us but for those who love fat pork, you hit a jackpot!! The deer meat was very different and came with some round bread crust. Surprisingly not very gamey. The bathroom is very clean and the atmosphere is very good. We were at the second floor. Price was a bit higher but you pay for what you get.","4 из 5 кружков","1279B823DFEB47E5F8A44A0B1AC1774F","Отзыв написан 8 апреля 2016"
"If i am going to have just 1 meal in Beijing, this will be the place i will go. Serves traditional food fare that are delicious. The restaurant is constantly busy but i never felt it was overly noisy or unmanagable. Waiting staffs were efficient and food prices reasonable.","5 из 5 кружков","67B16197899B1324A714801BBCB374EB","Отзыв написан 30 марта 2016"
"We have been here for the second time, first at noon and now at dinner. Atmosphere is old China, with lot of wood, two decks, a couple of talking blackbirds. People are well coming with some English. But with food the place reached the full stars. Try try Cauliflowers with pepper and garlic , the prawns spicely fried, the cold potato purea. All worth a visit!","5 из 5 кружков","BB92BE8F9F7018D56D8CB3A617AED199","Отзыв написан 27 марта 2016"
"Had a meal in a private room with 8 people, most of whom were Beijingers. So we had a wide range of dishes and an excellent meal was had. From such a wide range of dishes, highlights were:
BBQ'd beef rib, BBQ meat skewers, Sichuan Pepper fish, tofu and chilli beef, the lotus root cold starter.
Good value for the quality of the restaurant and the quality of the food.","5 из 5 кружков","541184820A615A84AAF75EF964E03A16","Отзыв написан 25 марта 2016"
"Very authentic and busy. The ladies on the door tending the waiting list are on the hop and there are many local customers. Don't let the view from the outside or the pure Beijing feeling inside be any threshold. The waitresses are looking after you here, just trust them. Inside decor is great. Very relaxed atmosphere. Now onto the food - there is a picture menu, but with style. So many things to choose from. When the food came it was better than the pictures and the taste...excellent, fantastic, mouthwatering - choose your own superlative. Only challenge here is not to overeat. The staff were outstanding and know exactly the fine line of attentiveness and interfering in a wonderful experience and meal.","5 из 5 кружков","415982C128CAAE6E8C09D902F29F5EAB","Отзыв написан 24 марта 2016"

"Travelling on my own for business and only speaking English, finding restaurants can be tough. This was an excellent find near my hotel, and thd menu is clarly in English and illustrated. Food was absolutely excellent, in a traditional setting.

The outside of the restaurant is not that clear, with just uniformed staff outside, so do not miss it.","4 из 5 кружков","C7AF45D0386A405917B2571CD92A4484","Отзыв написан 14 января 2016"
"We made reservations through our hotel and had no problems getting there from the subway line, which is about a five minute walk from the restaurant. I'd recommending familiarizing yourself with a photo of the entrance, just so you know what you're looking for.

Not much English spoken, but the menu is large, with colorful photos depicting the dishes accurately. Wonderful local delicacies, such as the Pork Belly with Beijing Dates, but just be warned that the portions are pretty large and are meant to be shared. We didn't realize that initially and ordered five or so plates for the two of us and ended up with a ton of food left over. I'd also recommend the Crispy Lychee Prawns, which are plump, sweet and savory.","5 из 5 кружков","7A5C3C40BF90E96663DE6CF04BE530B1","Отзыв написан 5 января 2016"
"This is the ultimate combination of great food with a very Chinese setting. The problem with places like Lost Heaven or Hakkasan is that whilst the food is fantastic, they lack the traditional loud busy Chinese feel. Na Jia Xiaoguan equals in food quality - although some dishes are a bit much for western taste - without sacrificing on mood. A must see whilst in Beijing. The women's toilets only have holes on the floor!","5 из 5 кружков","71A6B45652BEA9F9AB2673B7BA37860D","Отзыв написан 3 января 2016"
"Every dish served was tasty. Hot corn drink was served during winter, which I really enjoyed after being in the cold. The fish head and pork belly meat with dates were most memorable, but really, all dishes were good and our 12 seat table was filled with many dishes.","5 из 5 кружков","224B0504B29BCC617D0209DEF85E7809","Отзыв написан 8 декабря 2015"
"Always a wait, but usually moves quickly. Little English spoken but extensive menu available in English, with pictures, but with little description of food. Be adventuresome. Everything we had was excellent. Definitely not tourists-only as we saw mostly locals (and most of those were young).","4 из 5 кружков","5E7C96E62E586698F2DE3674277B0A8C","Отзыв написан 30 ноября 2015"

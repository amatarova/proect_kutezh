"Took family there as it was famous among visitors. Very posh looking place . They are famous for serving ducks that are less greasy but we still felt overwhelmed halfway through. The accompaniments were great though! One thing good, we went after lunch hour and they still served the roast duck.","4 из 5 кружков","07EA7CD0075DABE1B618B65FBAC28051","Отзыв написан 16 декабря 2016"
"Absolutely incredible duck. Not to be missed. I was lucky that a friend had recommended if I was in Beijing that I should go to Dadong. The table side carving was fascinating to watch and he presentation was incredible. We all overate but couldn't help ourselves. I was shocked at how affordable lunch was.","5 из 5 кружков","F4F057C06CCAD61789801B7DD2B20952","Отзыв написан 25 октября 2016"

"Fancy place strategically located near a main road. Steping inside you get afeeling of a contemporary yet casual restaurant, but then there are these open duck ovens at the heart of the place which makes you rethink it. My experience continued in one of many private rooms scattered over several floors, which two elevators lead to. The menu was a...

"It was an experience, entertainment, social and delicious. WE watched as they prepared the duck, the dishes arrived with extraordinary presentation and we were at a long table with several other travelers-so it was lots of fun!","5 из 5 кружков","BFED6258AB8652469412CA1CF5777189","Отзыв написан 27 июня 2016"
"On arrival, you will find the exterior of the building to be lacking much in the way of interest, except for the restaurant entrance (especially at night). Very limited parking, so plan accordingly. This restaurant is very popular so make sure you reserve a table (or private room for a group) to avoid long wait, especially dinner & weekends. The...

"We had lunch here for our parents' birthdays. Firstly, make sure you book a table to avoid long queue - especially dinner & weekends. Secondly, they have lots of different dishes, their menu book is thick, big and heavy, but it has English, which is good for me. Some of their dishes, especially seafood are extremely pricey. Even the normal...

"The Peking duck is very good with crispy skin that literally melt a whole duck sets you back by about US $75 and comes with condiments, wrapping pancakes and biscuits. The restaurant has many dishes and the famous chef has added a variety of duck dishes as well as steak and exotic Beijing style dishes. We tried a well marbled...

"Best peking duck ever. Hands down. Yes, it's about the same price as an upscale restaurant in the states (for example, it was just over $100 for dinner for two without drinks), but it is worth it. Everything we ordered was divine and beautifully presented. We got the fruit salad and it was by no means a salad - little...

"Outstanding decor, good service and very tasty food and excellent beer and wine selection. Not cheap by any means but we'll worth the price. Huge place yet it does not feel excessively overbearing. But ask for a small table which tend to be less central. Strongly recommended to make a reservation though do not despair if they fail to confirm....

"Very slick restaurant with a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes. Service was very efficient (lots of wireless communication) and a very modern setting with a large video screen, featuring the chef himself. The vegetarian starters (beans, pickled radishes, salad with sesame and a ceaser salad) was followed by beef and chicken dishes as well as the ubiquitous...

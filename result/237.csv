"This resturant ensures very good Hatsune food quality in a nice athmosphere. I've tried all three Hatsune locations in Beijing and they're all very good. Try the 119 roll and the famous long island iced tea...","5 из 5 кружков","D025EA0814115F6A29935FA4B80E7859","15 марта 2017"
"On the good side: The food is as good as the one from Hatsune Sanlitun. Outstanding Less good is the location, in the basement of the Kerry Center, and worse the restaurant layout and decoration are very common. No charm at all, but the impression to dine in a corridor. In summary only half of the pleasure of and outstanding...

"Hatsune has the consistency across all location that makes it so great. Been customer for 13 years (guanghua lu first); the rolls are just amazing and fairly creative. Food is fresh and the cooked one very tasty. The beed rotini is a killer and the lunch set a very good deal for quick bite on break. Hatsune is a BJ...

"Full of business persons from CBD during lunches or dinners. Decent Japanese food, and makes its name by creative dishes like its own version of sushi rolls. Its food range is wide to meet all tastes, from salad, sashimi to beef rice. Do book in advance as it can be full at peak hours.","5 из 5 кружков","E81D0B83A18211D9A0E0A6E891A3DCA6","Отзыв написан 12 июня 2016"
"Great quality food and a huge selection of different types of dishes. They have a number of very creative rolls, tried the soft shell crab and cream cheese which was very good. Prices are high for Beijing but low when compared to Japan or HK. Would recommend. Sushi is excellent quality.","5 из 5 кружков","1219D34FCDEA220114B05A8A1261C1FA","Отзыв написан 8 июня 2016"

"Best sashimi platter I have had in years - big section of UNI (sea urchin) which is terrific if you are a fan. All dishes were decent for izakaya style Japanese.","5 из 5 кружков","591477455569724634BFDED34E27218D","Отзыв написан 6 мая 2016"

"Hatsune is one of the more modern Japanese restaurant chain that appeals to those who want to enjoy typical Japanese offering plus some jazzed up sushi! They are famous for their many rolls which take you a good 10 minutes to study their combinations. I personally like their salad and everything with deep fried soft shell crab in it. Never...

"We had a lovely dinner on Friday night - even though it was very busy and we didn't have a reservation, we were still accommodated at the bar. The food was lovely, especially their tempura, and their asparagus in butter sauce. If you want some sophistication when it comes to your wine - beware of the young waiter who doesn't...

"Second time in Hatsune in a week traveling around Beijing. The place is in the heart of Sanlitun. The restaurant is modern and offer great sushis! Tasty, fresh and delicious.

"This restaurant is our favorite. We live really close by and we have it like 2-3 times a month. If you want to have lunch during working days, I suggest you to make reservation. It is pretty full here. There are good value lunch set (bento) around 78-88 RMB. You should try tuna salad! There is a challenging menu for...

"Despite our agreement to eat mostly local food while in Beijing, we could not resist trying out Hatsune while we were strolling in Kerry Centre. I am definitely going back there again when I want some Japanese food. We love their rolls which are all very creative although some dishes have this Unami sauce that is too sweet and too...

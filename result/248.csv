"Cool place located along the Liangma River, we loved sitting outside. Good selection of handmade pasta and really good lunch specials. Really good Panna Cottas.","4 из 5 кружков","F728F564ECBEA2916503E3420E61054C","Отзыв написан 22 октября 2016"
"Had a divine meal before flying back to uk. Tried the ravioli which was divine. Shared a platter for starter, fresh & fabulous ingredients served with love. Service attentive & not intrusive. Will definitely visit again in November.","5 из 5 кружков","5B2E74760D31C7DC1FB865062B37586C","Отзыв написан 11 октября 2016"
"We have been to this restaurant last week with my family. I am Italian and I can say that Fiume is better than many Italian restaurant in Italy! High quality of food, very nice location, good value for money. For lunch I would recommend the tasting menu. And at the end you can order the best Italian Tiramisu in Beijing...

"We were very disappointed! First, the glorious past: Fiume is the east 3rd ring cousin of Mercante, a similar Italian restaurant in the hutongs east of Houhai Lake. Previous dinners at Mercante and lunches at Fiume have been 4 star plus. Lunch at Fiume has been reasonable price and very good food, haven't done that in 6 months. Last night...

"We tried this restaurant for dinner during restaurant week which was 3 course meal for 258 RMB. There were 2 choices to choose from from appetizer, main and dessert. The overall quality of the food was good. Some of the dishes were lacking in salt but better bland than salty. Unfortunately, my main was a bit sad. I chose the...

"This is in a business area with a lot of ""OK"" restaurants as most Chinese office workers eat out every day at lunch. It's a bit more expensive than most of those places, but a lot more reasonable than nearby places associated with hotels, like the Brewhaus at the Kempinski. The food is excellent, the location is nice, and the...

"This tiny spot on the south side of the Liang Ma (opposite the Kempinski, which is on the north side) is great for lunch. The daytime seating lets you appreciate the floor-to-ceiling window design, and on a bright, low pollution day you don't feel like you're in the urban jungle that is Beijing. Lunch is also great because they offer...

"Easily one of the best Italian places in Beijing (and I say that having lived in Beijing for 3+ years). It's actually easily one the best restaurants in Beijing. Some of the best service I've experienced anywhere in the world. The cheeses on offer are delicious, the tortellini and ravioli are incredible, and the wine list is long. I can't...

"Italian food? But not all Italian. The accompaniments (or the lack of them) made this a less than satisfying dinner experience. I had the lamb kabobs (right, not really Italian) which were rather ordinary. They were nothing more than small lamb squares interspersed with peppers and onions. The menu does not describe the sad little lonely things that these kabobs...

"If you want to enjoy delicious and authentic Italian food, than this is your place. Everything is made fresh and tastes wonderful without any exception. And Andrea always find some time to explain the incredients and the origine of it.

"We dined here with friends and really enjoyed the food. As others have commented, it is very authentic Italian food. However, the space is tiny meaning that the diners are almost sitting on top of each other. This also makes service difficult for the wait staff to reach tables and indeed serve food. Sadly I could not recommend this restaurant...

"I went solo last night while in Beijing for work. I love Mercante, so I wanted to try the owners second place and it happens to be right by the office. It did not disappoint. Started with a Parma ham and quiche dish that was very nice and had the slow stewed donkey meat ravioli as my main. The ravioli...

"From the name, I thought it was Japanese, but, boy was I wrong. The set lunch we had was great. The service great. La Femmina spoke very good mandarin, which was good for my girl friend and give us very good service. Like she explained to us, what some Italian words meant on the menu. Will return for dinner the...

"In Beijing recent years there have been numerous self claimed Italian restaurant who offer nothing but crappy pizzas. If you are stuck in the city and get homesick for genuine home-taste and home-style Italian food, you got to try this one. A small cozy space by the side of a quiet river near the embassy area, this one gives you...

"Enjoy this restaurant very much, we were happy when this opened as it is closer to us than Mercante its sister branch which we used to frequent. The quality of food is excellent, service attentive and location cosy and romantic. Favourite dish is the gnocchi, chef is really happy to adapt dishes to vegetarian format and make somethings off menu...

"I read reviews and heard about this place, so we went to check out its business lunch. Well, maybe I was expecting too much. The place is nice, they put a lot of money into redecorating (used to be a CM clinic), but very small. Maybe too small. The staff is very friendly, much on the hipster side. The lunch...

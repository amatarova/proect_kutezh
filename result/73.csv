"My first time and wont be my last. Great choice of 16 wines by glass, and some at only 50RMB during the 5-9 pm Happy Hour. Everyone spoke good English, very good food especially snacks like Nachos, Sliders and Chicken Quesadillas. DJ early evening running into a live band until 1am. Also superb cocktails made by young and trendy people....

"The food in absolutely outstanding! Drinks are served in simple, retro glasses with minimal decoration- the emphasis is on what’s in the glass, not how it looks. Prices are based on the primary liquor and are extremely reasonable for such high quality bespoke drinks. However, we were sitting at the bar and if you want to book a table, there’s...

"Have visited several times. Always enjoy the music and lively atmosphere, especially between Friday and Sunday. Drinks are always as ordered although service at times can be slow. The burgers, especially the sliders are very good. Perfect snack food.

"Chic decor, great Happy Hour and they do have a terrace with heater. Such a find for smoker in the middle of Beijing's winter. The service is quite good, some waiters and supervisors are excellent. However, avoid ordering your drinks with the waitresses/hostesses, they usually aren't that efficient nor friendly, except if you're a guy or a local. Overall, a...

"We were guests at the Kerry hotel and wanted to drop by the hotel bar for a quick nightcap before bed. The bar looked nice and did not have many people so we thought it was a good choice. When we arrived, we were escorted to a high table. We requested to sit in one of the many empty sofa...

"In a great ambiance you can have your own Beijing duck! Freshly cooked in the ovens next to the tables, so you see the chefs at work.
Duck is cut at your table and served with loads of goodies to add more flavors.
They also have a great menu with a la carte dishes!
Don't forget to make reservations, otherwise you might end up waiting for a long time. But then again: waiting with a glass of something tasty at the bar it is also good!","5 из 5 кружков","BC04A468855EDC530EDE291CFB45DCD9","16 марта 2017"

"Our tour of Beijing included a dinner at this famous establishment. There were six of us and we were escorted into a private dining room. We watched with amazement at the skillful manner the Chef so expertly removed every morsel of duck meat. My previous experience with duck was always bad because it was not obviously prepared in this manner. With a shade of doubt, I wish I could have had more to eat, but the accompanying dishes were more than expected. The plum sauce slathered on the sliced duck meat was so yummy. I must stop. I'm beginning to salivate just thinking about it. A visit to this restaurant will be most rewarding.","5 из 5 кружков","D2F4130E946EDB3E44833BC981199C11","14 февраля 2017"
"Love the large open modern space. Kind of a surprise because you enter a non descript building, get in the elevator and...voila! Duck was delicious. Went with hubby's biz associate who ordered everything in Chinese and the yummy food just showed up. TONS of it. Nice wait staff.","5 из 5 кружков","E52E716E5ED523A29E6304EF37F2066A","11 февраля 2017"
"The duck and side dishes were excellent, also the starters from the extensive menu list. The aperitif (Whisky Sour) wasnt woth the price - just about 4cl incl. the ice and lemon.

Wine list is also a lot of pages, but as usual for good ones in China they are overpriced.

One problem is the service: it looks like it is not their profession, they serve dishes over the plates of others and were generally not very motivated.

Summary: the duck is worth it and consider around 30 EUR/person for it.","4 из 5 кружков","38256BC25D149875FBAEACEDA27E980F","Отзыв написан 7 февраля 2017"

"Dadong seems to be one of the most recommended restaurant for Beijing duck. We picked this one because it was within walking distance from our hotel.
Our tour guide called to make reservation for us the day before. The setting was nice and the restaurant was nicely decorated. The menu was thick and full of nice pictures of dishes. We ordered the original style duck (about C$280) and a few more dishes to go with it. The food was served quickly and the chef cut the duck behind our table. The duck was not as good as we expected. The skin was crisp but not too tasty. Meat was again ok but not great. Overall, we prefer the southern style roast duck. We felt that this was somewhat over-rated. As for the other dishes, we really enjoyed the thick chestnut soup/stew. We were surprised that each one of us was charged for the condiments for the duck. Not a big deal but had never seen this before. At the end, the provided a free dessert, fresh jujubes (red dates). It was quite refreshing and tasty.
I would recommend this restaurant if one hasn't tried Beijing duck before. But if you have tried traditional southern style roast duck (e.g. in Hong Kong), you won't miss much but skipping this.","3 из 5 кружков","EBC8CD6001AEE872EA978E73F891236C","Отзыв написан 30 января 2017"
"Being in Beijing for the eve of Chinese New Year meant there weren't many good options around but our hotel recommended Dadong as it was close by. Upon arriving it appeared they had a special New Year menu which included half a duck and trimmings, duck soup and dumplings which was about 200 RMB in total and sufficient for two people. We also ordered a vegetable side of mushrooms and bamboo (75 RMB) and some Voss Water (60 RMB). Overall the quality of the food was extremely high, probably the best duck I've tasted in Beijing. The service of the waiters was also very high, they covered all of our bags to keep them clean and safe, gave us a brief lesson on different ways to eat the duck and left us with a pretty red lantern to commemorate the New year. The English of the staff was adequate for ordering but doesn't stretch much beyond that. Although a little pricy the experience at Dadong was worth the investment for a truly memorable dinner on Chinese New Year eve.","5 из 5 кружков","46A4F8FCBF1C2B0C047EEA2E09B5B339","Отзыв написан 29 января 2017"

"Do not forget to book a table in advance. A modern interior looks like being specially designed for the foreigners (maybe?) - just to create more comfortable atmosphere. However no worries, the meal is typically Chinese. No chances to go through all the menu as its size including pictures is incredibly huge.
Roast duck is a must for sure. The most important thing is that if a visitor is a newbie the special lesson could be given how to eat this dish (or another one) properly in the line of the correct procedure.
Deserts are a special subject. Leave space in a stomach for them.
Unbelievable and real Chinese hospitality.","5 из 5 кружков","06F88586B1515D0A320D96D0244C3D85","Отзыв написан 11 января 2017"

"I had the opportunity to dine at this restaurant during a business trip. We had an elegant room for ourselves (a group of 7 people). Our host (a Beijing resident) ordered a sweet-sour pork, chicken, a flat-fish, a very special salad, soup and the famous roasted duck. Everything was excellent. The different flavors characterizing each dish were well harmonized together, yet they contained the strong character of Beijing cuisine. The service was excellent. We brought our own wine and they serviced it appropriately. Overall it was an great experience. I cannot comment on the bill as it was taken care by our host. I definitely recommend this restaurant.","5 из 5 кружков","98FE400EAC8211CBCDAF15D708FEB90B","Отзыв написан 25 декабря 2016"

"We choose this place cause it is very well reviewed on Tripadvisor and was also the closest Peking Duck restaurant to our hotel. After all, a bit dissapointed! Like, when in Beijing U should eat Peking Duck. Okay, taste was good but not WOW... Also it is quite expensive for what U get. Because it was our first time, we ordered a small duck to share. It is really small!! They come with the whole duck to your table and cut the meat in front of you. Nice ofcourse, but it takes such a long time that when they serve the meat is was really cold. Presentation was modern, more like in a chique hamburger way. Restaurant itself is nicely decorated, rather big which makes atmosphere less cosy. Nice restrooms! ,-))","3 из 5 кружков","92A4D3E979FF3046996026B8426D672F","Отзыв написан 13 декабря 2016"
"We made a reservation through the the hotel concierge of Park Plaza. We only wanted to taste the Peking duck and were told this restaurant had the best in the area, plus it was only a 2-minute walk from our hotel. There were 9 of us in the group. It started out good.our table was ready when we got there and was assigned a staff member who understood English. However, the waitress was changed after we were given the menus. We were presented with tomes for the menu on appetizers, entrees and wine and beverages, so only one set for the table and not one for each person. They were literally books! We had one person decided as it would take too long if we passed around the menus and had each person go through the books one at a time. All we really wanted was to taste the duck! My friend ordered 2 ducks for our table and then asked as to pick from 3 varieties of soup. When those orders were given to the waitress, she said we should order more as the duck would take 20 minutes to cook. She also told us to look at the other tables and see that other customers have a lot of food on their tables. This was so insulting! We were all not that hungry as we had a big breakfast and lunch, soup and the Peking duck were all that we wanted! She reiterated that the duck would take a long time to cook. My friend decided to just order some dumplings and small buns just in case the soup was not enough. Fine. Then we ordered beverages. Most of us wanted tea and the beverage book was handed to me. I didn't see a table of contents right away so I asked our snobbish waitress where the tea section was an also mentioned that we wanted green tea. Sh turned the pages to the tea section but there was no indication on the list which were green tea and no English description of the tea, but just the Chinese names. I told her we were not Chinese (wasn't that obvious??) so I had no idea from the Chinese names which ones were green teas. I asked for her recommendation and we settled on that. Very bad service from this one staff. Anyway, the duck came first before our soup nor dumplings!! None of the soup that we ordered was memorable. The Peking duck was good and another wait staff demonstrated how to assemble the meat with the condiments and the wrappers.he was nice although he didn't speak English. the rest of our orders were ok. My recommendation is look somewhere else for Peking duck. This restaurant is overrated.","2 из 5 кружков","2DCBEE73A2D128CCCA9049D2AD0436B8","Отзыв написан 12 декабря 2016"

". It has won all sorts of awards for best restaurant etc., as the front entrance walls were adorned with plaques to verify such. And we had a 7 pm reservation. Dadong was a very nice classy place. Centrally located in the restaurant was the duck roastery. A place with four open flame ovens, wood fired, and in each one was placed, 3-5 ducks. Our table was a large and glass and we seemed further apart, than usual. We had 3 wait staff and were well looked after even though one or more of our staff seemed a bit new to the job. We ordered a bottle of white wine, We ordered a large duck and 3-4 vegetable dishes. Each one a taste of diversity. Chop sticks were the norm as in most restaurants in China. Dadong was no different.

At one point after our duck had been delivered, one of the staff came by and showed us how to properly eat our duck with a 1) either a touch of sugar for the outside skin, 2) a puffed open pastry in which we would place the duck with various condiments that he suggested. 3) the last method was placing the duck with various other condiments in a rice tortilla and then folding it over using the chopsticks, ( quite a feat in and of itself!). All were delicious. The four of us had no trouble devouring the whole duck,","4 из 5 кружков","11666ED46423881A15AA45CD47605A2C","Отзыв написан 4 декабря 2016"

"The duck and in general the food were very good and I didn't even think I liked duck. We had a lovely reception from the hostess and someone brought us a free glass of water with lime while we waited for our party, but once we sat down, service was extremely inattentive. We were in a private room and members of our party had to get up multiple times and go out of the room to dine someone to order things from. Out party was a mix of locals and foreigners and I think everyone felt the service was lacking.","4 из 5 кружков","754D5C42695C8C368D55C8CF647FF669","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"

"This is the place to go, if you’re looking to “splurge” on a high-end meal, but not burn your wallet too much in the process. In addition to the well-celebrated roast duck, diners are treated to two heavy and cumbersome menus, with dishes bearing all the floss and foam that you’d expect from an episode of Chef’s Table.

Our party of 3 walked in after 8pm on a weeknight, were seated in 15mins, ordered half a duck, wine and a couple of dishes. We also received a selection of free dishes, too - including two desserts. In all, we set ourselves back by less than <U+00A5>800 (~$130 USD).

Overall, one of my favorite eats in Beijing - we can't say enough about them.","5 из 5 кружков","5E55E46E6D5E932C43F17D60F76D3D35","Отзыв написан 1 декабря 2016"
"Our hotel booked this location of Dadong because it was just a short walk, but we just loved this dinner. We had no idea how to navigate the 150-page menu so we let our waiter order for us. Duck for two (with the condiments), asparagus, fried rice and a great Tuscan blend wine. They also have a full bar with another 100+ page beverage menu. It is crowded and a bit of a fast pace to start but you can relax after your meal arrives. Make a reservation for sure. All in all a great Beijing/Peking experience.","4 из 5 кружков","285A35C61D9EDB5B8FA3A592B0F14935","Отзыв написан 26 ноября 2016"
"As you know the culinary speciality of Beijing is the roast duck. I was advised to go to this restaurant and it was the good advise.

"My all time favorite food is Pekin duck <3
I tried many since I love it so much. I had bad to wonderful experiences and I have to say that this restaurant is one if the best I have.

The skin of the duck is thin, well roasted and not too fat. The crepes are perfect, the condiments are nice. When you eat it, it's the perfect balance.

I tried the VIP and suckling duck and I think I liked the VIP best.

I tried a dumpling on the side but it wasn't very good. Oh well, doesn't matter, I came for the duck.","5 из 5 кружков","F0ACF608CA7D970EDAFB6FD590154228","Отзыв написан 23 ноября 2016"
"The restaurant is in a back yard in the center of Beijing,it ultra fancy and the public is Beijing's upper class.But the show is over done ,the menu weights 3 kilos and is so big that you can hardly carry it in your hands .It is over charged with meals to choose ,that it take half an hour to check the offer .The waiters don't understand a glue of english or any other language.and it seems to be a fast food restaurant the dishes are coming so fast that you haven't any time to enjoy the venue.our impression was this was a lot of show instead of real service and food.If you are looking for a Beijing duck the Qiamen Quanjude is definitively a better choice.The worst was they are unable to order a taxi that brings you back to the hotel !!!!!!","3 из 5 кружков","B1276FB79B4D5360E5B45F84AA197E05","Отзыв написан 21 ноября 2016"

"This restaurant is the epitome of exquisite Chinese cuisine that I had the fortune of tasting in Beijing.

Over the course of our trip, my wife and I had 3 Peking ducks in Beijing at 3 restaurants. This was by far the most stunning and delicious. The duck skin is crispy but melts in your mouth. The duck has the fragrance of the wood smoke. The duck bones are boiled into a light broth for you.

Their other dishes are all delightful. I really loved their sweet and sour pork. In most restaurants, ketchup is used as it's the easiest to create the sour flavor. Here, sour plums are used. The fragrance and flavor is refreshing yet alluring.

The attention to detail in the presentation of the dishes is astonishing. For every dish, I felt like I was eating an artwork.

The service is also top notch. Friendly and eager to assist.

If you have only one restaurant you're willing to pay for when you are in Beijing, choose Dadong!","5 из 5 кружков","4A044A013D098BBEC04C76E6B2C13F55","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"

"We ate here on the recommendation of a friend who had recently entertained here (on expenses!) and who raved about the Peking, sorry, Beijing Duck. So the four of us duly booked and went along for the experience. Now, I'm used to cooking this dish at home and, including pancakes and spring onion and cucumber and hoisin, I can feed four people for a budget of maybe twelve quid. And if we go to a restaurant, that figure maybe doubles. But at Dadong, you are looking at upwards of forty quid for small duck that will barely suffice as a starter. And if you order a main course thereafter, you are looking at paying Le Gavroche prices for, frankly, bog-standard Chinese fayre. The surroundings are pretty-ish, the service is okay-ish, the duck is… well, precisly how it always is… but the prices are indefensible. We had 1 starter and 4 beers, and then relocated to Molly Malone's (20 yards down the street) which is based back in the Real World.","3 из 5 кружков","4C1B1DEC70BBA4531A0E19D9E308E296","Отзыв написан 13 ноября 2016"

Overall, a good experience - love the Peking Duck, and the various dishes we had. Besides the Peking Duck, the other servings are small and very well presented. So we managed to order a variety of dishes. Had a bottle of Chilean Red that is reasonably priced & pretty good. The restaurant offers free wifi. We were there on a weekday night and judging by the crowd, one can get a table quite readily if you walk in after 8pm.","5 из 5 кружков","1A17AB88B90D7432B7890B40F9DE1CAF","Отзыв написан 13 ноября 2016"

"We have picked out 3 pecking duck restaurants to try while we were in Beijing; low, med and high-end, and dadong was obviously the most high end of the three and more than what we expected.

We were ushered to the bar while our table was being prepared where the wine list was extensive and impressive with both local and international wines.

We were served by the nicest floor staff and easily the best experience through our month long travel in China. She was polite, knowledgeable and super friendly, she has elevated our dinning experience at the restaurant.

We ordered one whole standard size duck 2 ways and one another dish, asparagus and bamboo shoots with truffle oil. It didn't disappoint.

The duck came with the usual pancake and sauces and additional condiments such as 2 types of pickles and a baked sesame pocket. The sugar was used to dip the skin in and both the duck skin and sugar just melts in your mouth.

Then there is the Norma way of eating the duck in pancake except the pickled cabbage added additional depth and texture.

The pickle <U+91AC><U+74DC> was then used to clean the palette between the 2 ways of eating the duck.

The soup was flavoursome and a nice addition to the duck where the temperature washed away the fat.

To finish off, we were served free local fruit called <U+51AC><U+68D7> and Chinese black sesame pudding. What a way to end the meal.

It's probably the second best Peking duck I've had in my life (and I've had a few). The service, decor and cleanliness was second to non and you can be assured that there won't be any issues with the food served in this restaurant.

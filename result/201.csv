"The name of the restaurant in Chinese means ""the filling of the dumplings is always in abundance"". How true. Not only they are very cheap (average price is Euro2.40/10 pieces), they are delicious. However besides the dumpings, the other few dishes that I have tried aren't that fantastic nor cheap. ( I went there twice) The waitresses appeared to be...

"Our tour guide had suggested lunch here and when we saw the line, we figured it was good! Huge selection of dumplings! The mushroom and leek were our favorite! Yes we had a wait even for lunch but it was worth it. This place seems to be mostly popular with the tourists vs the locals.","4 из 5 кружков","58B6F195F977412E7293D8BEF1A479CE","Отзыв написан 1 сентября 2016"
"Atmosphere was lively. More of a tourist trap than authentic dumplings compared to the Dian tan sum but had to say the service and price made up for it.","3 из 5 кружков","5470D050D81A80C6986F6DD3991B244B","Отзыв написан 18 июля 2016"
"We ate here after visiting The Great Wall at Mutianyu. We ordered the Lau Man Dumplings, Fried Green Beans, Kung Pao Chicken, Lau Man Meat Pies and they made a simple chicken and noodles for our daughters. The dumplings were soft but crispy and really really full with lovely minced pork and huge pieces of prawn. The fried green beans...

"I've been to several branches of this dumpling restaurant, and the food is amazing every time. It's really all about the dumplings here. Get the pork and corn dumplings, and the shrimp and pork. Get some fried, some boiled. They are all really good. Make sure to order enough beer when you sit down because the wait staff can be...

"We visited this restaurant at the Great Wall Mutianyu location. It was fantastic! The dumplings, the broccoli, the soup, the sauces, were all so delicious! It was the perfect ending to a great day climbing the wall. Clean, good service and refreshing beers too. Highly recommend stopping here for lunch if you at Mutianyu!","5 из 5 кружков","A45D1C39137F53022DA6E67E718D1705","Отзыв написан 11 января 2015"

"Another great recommendation from our hotel (The Orchid). We arrived to a restaurant full of locals and were given a number to wait for a table. The wait was not too long and then we were shown to our table upstairs - think there was only one other Western couple in the restaurant. The staff don't speak English (and we...

"Until recently there were no concessions for non-Mandarin readers, but despite a newly introduced English menu, there hasn't been much of a change here. Mostly locals here, and cheap, well made food that is all Beijing's cuisine should be.","5 из 5 кружков","08B2187507132C37E72DE76B782D14CE","Отзыв написан 10 сентября 2014"
"A short walk from Lama and Confuscious temples, this is a great place for lunch or dinner. We only had the dumplings, but non-dumpling dishes served to other diners looked good too. Pretty basic diner atmosphere. English menu makes it easy for non-Mandarin readers/speakers, and the waitstaff is very helpful and attentive.","5 из 5 кружков","88022DBBF95A54494B7CBE21CF36D089","Отзыв написан 9 июля 2014"

"Weekend Lunch with a group of friends:
Overall a 4 star version of the fine dining TRB - this is more like a Bistro.
Menu concept and dishes very similar to TRB but lacking the finesse and quality.
We noticed an Expat Restaurant Manager there who spent all his time in front of the kitchen counter chatting away with his colleagues rather than taking care of the guest and service.
Overall below average - not to be repeated","3 из 5 кружков","879CA2198BFEADA762BACDECD736DABF","9 марта 2017"
"Went here for a wine brunch that was provided by Le Sommelier and it was excellent! Pairing were spot on! It was actually a crystal clear blue sky day in Beijing so the views were excellent!

Great staff, wine, and service! Would recommend going at night because that's when all the lights are on and everything is lite up! Also during the day parking was a problem as it's right next to a tourist attraction!","5 из 5 кружков","E47A10AAA7EE52C02CC2DD140452D912","27 февраля 2017"
"Decided to go there with my fiancee under the recommendation of a friend. We were blown away from the beginning til the end. Many options for the food between 3,4 courses or tasting menu.
The food was well presented and very tasty.
What amazed me, it's the service. Everything was more than perfect. Every little details, explanation of the dishes. They are working with their heart and not like machine.
Thank you so much for the lovely evening and hope to come back soon.","5 из 5 кружков","18F7A91F146466E131D0AE9C0B443ED9","26 февраля 2017"
"TRB Bites is TRB's take on easy and relaxed dining. Here every 2-3 weeks.
Location:
The location is superb, every time I have friends visiting from out of Beijing, this is the place to go. It's directly located next to the float in front of the east gate of the forbidden city.
Food:
I do like the food here, mainly western focus with a few tailored Chinese-ish dishes. Make you own menu type of ordering - same as TRB. Fixed price for x amount of dishes. The amount/quality of the free ""bites""/""palate cleansers"" between dishes tend to vary according to the how busy the location is and the time of the day you are there (i.e. last time I was there for an early morning brunch, they only wiped up only 2 very simple ""bites""...slightly disappointed)
Environment/service:
If you go there as it was intended, for a casual, open but also slightly refined meal, you won't be disappointed. For informal meetings with friends this is great. Service is slightly lacking when it gets busy, you get a slight feeling of it being just a little understaffed when the place is full, so you might have to stand up and signal to someone when needed. But the response time is adequate. Don't expect all the service of fine dining, but then again if that's want, you have to go their fine dining restaurant TRB. This is a place where you can relax and chat up with friends, all the while with a fantastic view of the forbidden city. For me, although it has it's downsides, but the location + food/service combination until now is unbeatable. For first time visitors to Beijing, it's worth a try, but be sure to reserve in advance.","5 из 5 кружков","455A44F5C73FCFB89E8BADC7E37F0B9E","15 февраля 2017"
"My husband and I went for our anniversary. We have been to TRB before and wanted to try Bites. The service and food is just as amazing as TRB.

"We took my sister here for her birthday as she was visiting from Canada. The TRB staff were extremely helpful in making this experience memorable, right from reservations to the end of brunch. It was the highlight of my sister's trip. Since the restaurant is right beside Forbidden City (with nice views of it), you may want to pair this with a visit there if visiting Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","B6F888CFE92E8FFFCE8C536503601FD7","Отзыв написан 5 февраля 2017"
"I went to TRB bites with a group of friends during Beijing Restaurant week. we ate from a set menu. Each course was excellent, the ingredients were fresh and the dishes complimented each other extremely well. The staff are excellent, they are bilingual and very attentive which is definitely not the norm in Beijing. If you are local for somewhere to spend a specially occasion this would be an excellent choice.","4 из 5 кружков","700F505166E80DA74BA9C268183EA1BB","Отзыв написан 5 февраля 2017"

"Had a enjoyable lunch at Bites with my missus.
Situated outside the East Gate of The Forbidden City. The 4 course lunch was delightful from soup to dessert. Especially loved the Octopus n the Beef Cheek dishes. Service was excellent, we didn't hv long breaks in between dishes which is the way we like to be served. Others might like a slower pace. Extras like welcome drinks n red wine were served. Nice touch for first timers like us with chocolate dessert n a photo of us at Bites! A definite dining place for us whenever we are in Beijing again!","4 из 5 кружков","75A8B14EF4EB8B99F6DAEE1CC8119DE7","Отзыв написан 22 января 2017"

Ask for Stephen and for his recommendation to plan your meal. He did for us 3 diners and we were amazed. Food portion is just right with molecular infusion and creating presentations. The taste is brilliant too. They even clicked our picture, sent us thank you email and gave a farewell gift.

Thank you and happy new year.","5 из 5 кружков","2DD817FAC7AEB2189F3A43E8685779D8","Отзыв написан 1 января 2017"
"First of all I’d like to say that the temple restaurant (TRB) has been our favorite restaurant in Beijing for some time now and we were asked to try the TRB bites which promises to have a more casual approach to fine dining. My husband and I have a 3 month old Baby so we were first a bit hesitant to go to fancy restaurants in general but after all we figured if we wanted to continue our fine dining experiences than this might be just the spot for us.



After we arrived at the restaurant we were welcomed by Peter, the Assistant Director of Operation and he seated us at a great table with a Temple- view. The look and style of the restaurant was different from the TRB – the seats and the open kitchen had an inviting touch. Upstairs there is a separate room in which the restaurant is able to hold special events like business dinners etc.



You could tell from the menu that the elements of the TRB very similar to the TRB bites but the dishes still all sounded different. We first got served some small Bites, of interesting and new tastes, really creative creations. I really liked the cucumber pastille, it tasted like a handful of fresh and cold cucumber salad.



After that we tried a lot of different dished and a tasteful surprise that went really well with my husband’s champagne was the duck egg custard, we have never eaten it before and we loved it!



The next dish my husband tried was Thai-like red-curry dish (“Pawn”) which was paired by the restaurants’ recommendation with the J.M. Boillot Domaine Les Roques Blanc, 2013 which had an apricot finish to it that went amazingly well with the gently sweet finish of the Pawn dish. For my husband this combination was truly genius and is now one of his all-time favorite food-wine combos of all time. I got scallops, which were spot on perfectly cooked and fresh.

Among some other dishes we were also served the bone marrow dish, which neither of us have ever seen before and tasted exceptional.

A beef cheek came as a final meat course to complete our surf & turf experience, it was soft, tasty and we simply loved it. As dessert I had a fruit cake and a chocolate mousse cake, very thick and rich in chocolate. My husband had a white chocolate mousse which he loved.



There is two people in particular that made our dining experience one of the best we had in Beijing so far: Peter Teng who took care of us the whole evening - and who really helped us out wherever he could when we had some difficulties with our baby. Also the Chef Sebastian Schaefer who's food and wine recommendations really brilliant and I think with the menu he was really able to distinguish the restaurants food from the TRB. It was exceptional and perfect service, all the other service staff was very friendly and attentive.



Summary of the evening: excellent service, like at TRB itself, creative and delicious. More casual than the TRB so its absolutely suitable for visiting with a Baby or children while still having the fine dining experience. TRB Bites is definitely an alternative to TRB, you have the great service and comparable excellent food and the prices of the TRB bites are a bit lower going hand in hand with the more casual style.","5 из 5 кружков","1B5E95D3FBAF2123EB6A0C7E1B1B9373","Отзыв написан 31 декабря 2016"
"We returned to Beijing to celebrate our 10th anniversary at the same, most beautiful venue just opposite to the East Gate of the Forbidden City, “the courtyard” where we met 15 years ago. The place is now the TRB Bites Restaurant.
We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly hospitality and the delicious food. When the stuff realized the reason of our celebration, we were overwhelmed by various tasty treats “on the house” the chef Sebastian Schafer came to see us and our fantastic waiter Mr. Dee Lesmana took so good care of us that it made our celebration really unforgettable. We spent wonderfull evening in the TRB Bites.For sure we shall return.Highly recommend! 5 star plus","5 из 5 кружков","56572D1D635DEADD87807D81FAFC565B","Отзыв написан 3 декабря 2016"
"TRB is the best restaurant in town, with refined French cuisine, excellent food, perfect service, friendly and extremely polite and discrete staff.

"We came here after seeing the great reviews on Trip Advisor. It was our first meal in Beijing and it was by far one of the best experiences I have every had at a restaurant. The staff is so nice and attentive. They even asked if we wanted to change tables in order to sit by the window for a premier view of the Forbidden City. How thoughtful!
This restaurant is practically connected to the Forbidden City along the river giving a very authentic feel.
Now about the food. The idea is simple. You decide how your menu looks. You have a choice of 3 or 4 courses. The choices are broken up into three categories (fresh, tender, and savory). I chose the Scallops (amazing), the Salmon (delicious with the sauces on the plate), and the Beef (must get). 3 courses for 298 RMB. This is such a deal! The chef is European but worked in Thailand so there is a wonderful southeast asian ting to the plates.
Long story short, if visiting Beijing, go to TRB bites!","5 из 5 кружков","D69536F9B0B51ECFF5E2C1449DF32F40","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"
"World class service and food experience.
I found this place through Trip Advisor after my 4.5 hours strolled in the Forbidden City. The place just at the side of the East gate of the Forbidden City and the river that surround the Palace.

I was very lucky that Dee greeted and ushered me to the table just next to the window with the view of the river.

I like how the amouse bouche with cucumber woke up my palate to start the 3 course meal and my choice of chocolate cherry dessert to end the meal.

As a solo traveller, I received so many surprises during my lunch meal. From the local sparkling wine to the chocolate cake (beside what I ordered) as the dessert.
Thank you for such hospitality that made me feeling like a regular customer of TRB instead of just the tourist. Especially to you Dee!","5 из 5 кружков","DD7AFB0D8D2A4E8B2572C536216AC478","Отзыв написан 27 октября 2016"
"Our first time in TRB Bites was a Sunday, we tried the brunch.
It was a nice moment, with a great freedom given to the customers to elaborate their menu, according to their own taste. Brunch comes with Danish pastries, muffins, an excellent Italian style bread, jams and pate.

Service was a bit slow, but both restaurant managers are very professional, ensuring every customer satisfaction.

Dishes served are excellent, original and never pretentious.

Cheese plater came without butter, this is a bit surprising, especially knowing that the waitress we asked for butter (in English and Chinese) was not able to understand our request as she brought a kind of ""pate"".

I recommend to choose a table upstairs, it's smaller and brighter. Sometimes, the noise was a bit loud, despite the fact only 8 tables are concentrated on this small area. It's certainly due to construction issues.

Reservation is better as only few tables are near a window facing one of the wall of the Forbidden City. An amazing and unique restaurant location.

As we were driving we tried the valet-parking provided by TRB bites, but we had to wait for quite a long time inside our car near the forbidden city. Police started to question us, it was a bit embarrassing. We also were surprised that no ticket, or voucher was given to us when the valet came to pick up the car. This aspect should be reviewed by the management.

We sometimes have dinner to Temple Restaurant in Beijing, the mother company of TRB Bites, and it was nice to feel the same attention to customers.","5 из 5 кружков","533EB78B83CE026E4369161CB1D59304","Отзыв написан 24 октября 2016"
"TRB Bites is tucked in one corner along an alley next to the Forbidden City. After dining chinese and peking ducks in past 2 days , this is a gem and a pleasant surprise serving european in Beijing.

"TRB Bites is an inspiring experiment in bringing European Haute cuisine within the historical heart of China. The restaurant is situated just a stone’s throw to the East Gate of the Forbidden City and some tables on the 1st and 2nd floor have an unspoiled view over the moat of the gate. Despite this important setting the atmosphere is elegant but informal. The staff is international and extremely courteous; we can assure you that there is no better service throughout Beijing. Especially the manager, Evan, is doing everything to make you feel at home and the evening a special event. The food is excellent and the management keeps the menu intriguing by organising various gastronomic collaborations, both from Europe and Asia. We heartily recommend TRB Bites. Our visits, as a couple and with friends, have always been an enjoyable and delicious experience.","5 из 5 кружков","7764F6670D2DFCA24D74C71117DCD587","Отзыв написан 22 октября 2016"

"I try to avoid giving poor reviews but I feel that as I have given TRB a good write up in the past I should revise this after two poor experiences. One visit was in April or May this year and I thought it might be a one off. One was this month. Very very poor service both times. Friendly yes, but just not competent. The staff were attentive but just not skilled enough nor were they being adequately managed - forgetting to bring out a whole course on a fixed four course menu takes some doing. I could almost forgive even this is the food was excellent but alas it was tired by the time it was delivered to the table and I was left very very underwhelmed.","2 из 5 кружков","132CF01B4B3B6DFE9AAE4D0A3D270344","Отзыв написан 13 октября 2016"

"We had heard wonderful things about TRB bites and finally had a chance to go there for a late anniversary dinner. We were not disappointed! It was not crowded at all because of the national day holiday. We had an excellent table with a very nice view of the forbidden city. Everything, and I mean everything was absolutely delicious. The presentation is spectacular and the mixture of flavors in indescribable, and to top it the service was unusually good for Beijing. As for the dishes they were all extremely delicious, my daughter enjoyed the octopus very much and I would certainly also recommend the steaks. Since it was an anniversary celebration they treated us with complimentary champagne and also a cake which I'm not sure they always do but it was very uncrowded due to the holiday. It is not a very formal restaurant but I would describe the experience as being one of the best dinner experiences I've had in Beijing and I've had thousands in Beijing over several decades.","5 из 5 кружков","7FE7524B9AE66C3A73084FEB134A7D9B","Отзыв написан 8 октября 2016"

Only issue I had was that they served fake cavier. Having asked the waiter he assured me that it was real. The menu didn't hide that it was ""Avruga Cavier"" which is a brand of caviar substitute but the mark up in price for the dish and the waitor saying it is real makes me think they want to steer you into thinking it was real. One mistake wouldn't stop me going again as the food really is brilliant. Berny from BernyEatsTheWorld.","4 из 5 кружков","CE906C8DE1D49EFC6C1B7CBB8EC2D3AE","Отзыв написан 20 сентября 2016"

"This little gem is located a few minutes away from the East exit of the Forbidden city. We were looking for a nice place t have lunch but ""Bites"" really exceeded our expectations.
The ambience is elegant but yet ""approachable"". We were greeted with a smile and, even though we had no reservation, the manager offered us a nice table.
The menu is a fusion of high end gourmet French cuisine with a touch of amazing local flavours (fois gras ice cream anyone...?). The flavours were a great break from the traditional Chinese cuisine that we were having on a daily basis.
But, most importantly, visit this place for the amazing service. The place is sparkling clean, the ambience is cool with view to the Forbidden city walls.

"This was my 2nd time at Bites after they have opened.

A few details have changed giving it a more casual feel, first one that comes to your eyes is the fact of not having table cloth anymore.

In terms of food, this restaurant has made a great progress with the new Chef. Very good food yet simple but well done with a twist here and there.

The amouse bouch selection was good to start. Bread was brought..perfectly baked, I have to say.

My first and favorite dish of the night was cauliflower. Basically all the food on that dish is based on cauliflower vegetable. You can taste different textured food with cauliflower based components. For instance, cauliflower dish was composed of cauliflower mousse, cauliflower puree, cold cauliflower in a sort of meringue shape with a twist of sweetness (probably white choc), cauliflower carpaccio and caviar. All together gives a great fresh yet very well done dish.

Quinoa salad was also very good. This is a good example of what bites can be.. salad, a ""simple"" dish yet very well done.. all veg fresh, good seasoning, simple dressing with a touch of sweetness, all together very well balanced.

Octopus with chorizo and puree was equally well done, specially when paired with the great chorizo sauce present on that dish.

Cod fish with coconut was very good and to finish, lamb was also very good.

Congratulations to the new Chef to cook very good food without inventing too much, with very taste. It seems that Bites has found an identity when it comes to food served.","5 из 5 кружков","57E05F79484CA4038735ADE363FBA830","Отзыв написан 31 августа 2016"

"Was wowed in the first 20 min but left dissappointed. Loved the complimentary champagne and the bread basket filled with delicious pastries (and refilled to out delight).

But when the courses started coming cold and after long delays, the glitter started to dull. Started noticing all the errors the staff were making with our table and others and the confusion all over the dining room. Watched our meals cool 2 feet away from us waiting for servers to appear. After interminable waits for our courses to come, we sighed a breath of relief when dessert arrived and we could finally leave.

$60 CAD for 3 small (but filling) courses and $20 for a bottle of water :(

The food was beautifully presented but cold and short of delicious.

Overall a wonderfully surprising and pampered meal unfortunately tarnished but inexperienced staff.","3 из 5 кружков","40B51738010CC4DDAEEF6F83AD848FE4","Отзыв написан 21 августа 2016"
"We tried TRB previously and thought about treating ourselves to an afternoon tea before heading home - what a great choice! The location is phenomenal and the food, well what can I say. Beautifully presented, tasty (who can go past freshly baked scones) and filling...we could barely move! It was a fantastic way to spend out last afternoon in Beijing and the service was impeccable. Attentive and considerate, the service was above and beyond what was expected. The owner spoke with us and wished us well on our departure - this has never happened to us before. The afternoon tea is a must for anyone looking for a sweet and savory treat with amazing views.","5 из 5 кружков","688704BA500E9EE7961E138FEF38E320","Отзыв написан 20 августа 2016"
"My colleague and I found this restaurant by accident back in March (I forgot to write the review then because we were on a hectic business trip) and we managed to come back twice in two days. This restaurant is an absolute treat - the food is spectacular, very beautifully served, fresh and tasty, the presentation and service were impeccable, I wouldn't know what I loved most, the amazing beef, the deconstructed cheese cake, the scallops - all wonderful.

A particular mention should go to the manager Evan Horsman, who has been so welcoming and wonderful to us, spoiling us with attentions, amuse-bouches and other little things, as well as his lovely company. We can't wait to be back in November!

*the price is unbeatable, <U+00A3>40-50 for one of the best meals of my life.","5 из 5 кружков","F5F714E363BFFAB9DFF3EEDDDFBD792F","Отзыв написан 17 августа 2016"
"I'm a huge fan of the original TRB, and had been meaning to try Bites for a while. I went with a friend this past weekend because I saw that Bites has a free-flow drinks deal, and we wanted a fun/relaxing/boozy brunch. It turned out to be the complete opposite.

We sat upstairs, and things weren't off to a great start. Both my friend and I had dead bugs in the bottoms of our empty champagne glasses. To our surprise the server wasn't apologetic at all, but whatever. There were a few other very small things that were off... the moist towelettes were stained, the menu was grimy, that sort of thing. Nothing worth complaining about, but definitely a step down from TRB's perfection.

We each picked 5 courses and ordered the two hour free-flow drinks. My friend and I speak some Chinese, which is good because the server's English was really limited. The food began to arrive, and it was really, really good. The duck egg and octopus dishes in particular made me want to lick the plate. But... still no drinks. The servers didn't check in on us, and seemed stressed out when we did see them. I heard the male server snap at the female server a few times, which didn't make for a super pleasant atmosphere.

We finally ask about our drinks, and are told that they're coming soon. A moment later the server brings out a bottle of champagne. We start to get excited... until it's given to another table. The server was carefully avoiding eye contact with us at this point. Very odd.

Another hour passes. The upstairs is a TINY space, and there were two servers dealing with four tables. But it was ridiculously difficult to get their attention and they constantly disappeared. Finally, TWO HOURS after we ordered, the male server finally comes over and tries to explain the problem with the drinks. I speak ok Chinese, but couldn't quite understand what he was saying. He offered us a glass of free champagne, which we accepted. But of course, it was the end of the bottle so it was pretty flat and my friend only got half a glass. At that point it was just funny.

And, to top it off, we only received four out of the five courses we ordered. Again, we spent a lot of time trying to get the attention of the servers, who finally told us they thought we had ordered four. But, to be honest we were relieved because were so excited to leave!

In sum, the service was comically bad, to the point where it distracted from an otherwise delicious meal. It's not just that it wasn't up to TRB standards. It was literally the worst/weirdest service I've ever had in my life. The cumulative issues and the complete lack of communication was absurd. I do wonder if it was just dysfunction with the upstairs team, but I don't think I'll be back to try the downstairs. Skip Bites, and stick with the original TRB!","2 из 5 кружков","02D70173DBFFB289C54084AC828CD499","Отзыв написан 15 августа 2016"
"I went there with 2 colleagues for the first time.
The location is great, the service is young and very professional.
But most of all, I love the idea of small bites very tasty and to choose several of them at reasonable price.

Conclusion: TRB spirit in a new body, a modern recipe close to a thousand year monument. The taste of modern Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","C33D06AD5B5B40266759F9D074365A0C","Отзыв написан 11 августа 2016"

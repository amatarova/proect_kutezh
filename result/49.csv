"I went a few times to the new Nuo Hotel in Beijing and enjoyed the dinning experience each time. This year we spent the night in the hotel and we had the lavish New Year's buffet at N'Joy Restaurant. It was a great experience!

"We often go to N'Joy not only because it really has the best brunch in the city ( it can certainly cannot be compared to limited amount of international food at other five star hotels and international ones as Westin, Four Seasons etc.) because we feel there at home and perfectly taken care of. Arnaud who is F& B Manager...

"Have lived in Beijing for a long timeand this has stolen the title as the best breakfast in town, in my honest opinion. The staff is highly professional with all the attention you could expect from a place of this standing. Highly recommended for those who appreciate quality.

"Generally it was a great brunch but after visiting several times and to many other hotels over the past 15 years there are improvements needed. On a positive side the Indian kitchen is great and the service and food is exceptional. The roast meats are very nice but are lacking a simple gravy to go with the lamb or beef,...

"Not only the food assortment is above competition, the ingredients used are above the city's standard. I have a certain experience on food and i' m convinced that people should ask them self more ""how much they should pay for good food"" rather than 'how much food is expensive' and at 388 rmb its the sweetest most delicious and satisfying...

"Nice Sunday brunch. The best part of this brunch has to be getting a choice of Champagne, however would be better if offered a taste first to make a selection. The Indian station was great and the staff very friendly. The meat counter was a little disappointing. The meat, both lamb and beef were a little salty and the person...

Amazing selection of great seafood - lobster, oysters, shrimp, amazing tuna flown-in from Japan - and whole range of meats, BBQ, cold cuts, salads, cheeses, Chinese, Indian, and even some Arabic specialties. Some excellent choices of free-flow champagne. Mojito's were great. I did not have dessert, but my friends enjoyed...

"NUO brunch is always our first choice in town. We have tried many buffets in China five star hotels, I have to say NUO is the best so far. Variety and food display are excellent.

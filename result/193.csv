"My favorite bar in Beijing at my favorite hotel! It's pricey here but worth the investment if you seek to unwind after a busy day.","5 из 5 кружков","E9DE6FF26FE23CF700C6F7051619A583","Отзыв написан 10 августа 2016"
"One year after, I returned to this place. Not because I have money coming out of my pockets - actually I order the cheapest thing: a beer (50yuan) - but sometimes you need to TREAT YOSELF :D So even if you are like me - someone who is totally fine with a average bar but good and cheap beer -,...

"What a fantastic view from the bar. Lovely attribute at the hotel where Beijing is at our feet, with stunning views in all directions. Service was just all right... as I asked if they had red bull and sparkling wine (yes they do) and ordered that wine cocktail but was told that it was not in the computer so will...

"The China Bar offers a nice selection of drinks with a great view of Beijing, especially at night. The cocktails are well-mixed and some delicious nuts are served to accompany the drinks. The live music is nice and not too loud so that conversation is still possible. A great place to have a drink after dinner.","5 из 5 кружков","4D663E10B6DB73532E2A2D2C89612BEC","Отзыв написан 29 октября 2015"
"The first night we had some delicious drinks before our dinner upstairs at China Grill. Our barkeep, a young lady, spoke perfect English and knew a lot about drinks and make a terrific Martini. The second night we didn't really know who was our bartender but we still enjoyed ourselves. We ate at the bar this night. It was good...

"After dinner in China Grill we went to China Bar, which is located one floor below on the 65th floor. Same as China Grill, the views are magnificient. As you can expect from Hyatt, the service was excellent with an extensive list of beers from all over the world. Even Brooklyn IPA was served, which I like very much to...

"This location is stunning. At the apex of the Park Hyatt at the Yantai Center complex downtown, it's the perfect place to go for a romantic evening or to bring out of town guests to 'Wow' them the the 360 degree panoramic views of Beijing's expanse. The service is good, and on par with any global luxury hotel chain. However...

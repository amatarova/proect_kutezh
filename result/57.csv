I would like to give my special thanks to the Chef Antonio. He came out to say hi to everyone and gave the children candies and deserts which they loved very much. Also he...

"Having switched this year to more emphasis on Marriott instead of SPG properties, I've stayed at JW Marriott at 3 different continents this year, and have come to expect absolutely exemplary service and taste from all their restaurants. However, Casalingo was a disappointment. While the service was good, the food was not worthy of this hotel. At the server's suggestion,...

"I was here for the Great Wall Marathon. It was a wonderful experience and coming back to the hotel for westernized cuisine, even if it was Italian, was great. I ordered from the menu while in the lounge as well as dined in the restaurant. The pizza is delicious. The dining area is open to the kitchen with tables outside...

"We needed something to eat on our first evening a went to the restaurant on the ground (first) floor of the JW Marriott Hotel in Beijing Central. We were bemused to see that it was an Italian restaurant, but enjoyed the food none the less.","4 из 5 кружков","19969D832535C48B5D0C02EE97FC8BDE","Отзыв написан 19 апреля 2016"
"Our party of three had the four cheese pizza, the mushroom risotto, and the cheese lasagna. All entrees were very good...... especially considering we were in a China hotel ordering Italian cuisine . Order a glass of wine and you'll get access to the antipasto bar which had great olives, breadsticks , Italian cold cuts, garlic bread, and other tasty...

"This is a fairly nice restaurant, with pleasant outside seating. Shame that the music is too loud and that the service is amateur and inattentive. It's clearly not the fault it the servers as they simply haven't been trained and don't know what they're doing. Perhaps because its the weekend, all of the ""bosses"" take days off. It would be...

"I have had two experiences at this restaurant/bar over the past three days. The first was oddly positive; the other very was very negative. While staying at the Beijing JW Marriott centrally located near Xuanwu Men rail station (a very nice hotel with extremely nice people), we had afternoon drinks at Casalingo in the hotel lobby. The day was very...

"Even though I felt the overall quality of this property was poor (prior review), on our last night we discovered a great restaurant at the hotel. Casalingo. We were met by Julie and Luca upon entering. Both had very good command of English and seated us at a nice view table. Luca took the time to explain his philosophy for...

"This newly opened restaurant features great Italian food in a luxurious atmosphere. The service was excellent, including an explanation of the food and ingredients by the Italian chef. Though this was my first visit to this restaurant, I plan to visit it again to try additional dishes, including the pizza they spoke of with pride. Overall, this restaurant is better...

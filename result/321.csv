"Pastries, fried milk balls, and many other ""weird"" but interesting dessert from Beijing local cuisine. Recommended for thrill-seekers (believe me, you have never tasted something like it, it is very LOCAL) and foodies. Also HuGuoSi is a very nice place for weekend walk and enjoy Beijing hutong atmosphere.","4 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 25 апреля 2016"

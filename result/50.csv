"I'd go as far to say this is the best Vietnamese place outside of Vietnam itself. A great, though hard to find location, with a fantastic roof terrace. The food is both authentic and sublime.

"Light, flavorful dishes served in a beautifully renovated hutong tucked away off the busy streets. Nice selection of flavorful salads, entrees and wines. Loved the fresh spring rolls. Definitely a favorite of ours since moving to Beijing. Can't wait to return!","5 из 5 кружков","5C8153470820D5ED6D868FC846C1C403","Отзыв написан 14 января 2017"
"You have to venture down a long and slightly dodgy alley (hutong) to find this place but it is so worth it. Susu is a warm and lovely little Vietnamese restaurant with incredible pho, which we enjoyed with spring rolls and chili lemongrass chicken for lunch. They have a nice wine list as well and a pretty courtyard in the...

"Surely this is one of the places you will hardly find on your own. So best have somebody giving you precise directions. Once you crossed the wooden Chinese door (sorry, no signage whatsoever!), you enter a pretty smart and relaxed atmosphere. The food is mostly southern Vietnamese fare. Do try the nice fish dishes, they are wonderfully done. Very tasty!!...

"For those who love nice decoration and mixes of modern and traditional oriental cuisine, Susu is a place to stop by. Service is very good and dishes are very well made.

"Very charming restaurant hidden in the hutongs. Food is very good but prices are on the high side. However, definitely worth a visit when in Beijing. Firstly, you will get fabulous Vienamese fusion food, secondly, you will get to be amazed by the hutongs and the typical local life that goes on there. Thirdly, the inner courtyard style eatery has...

"Unfortunately Susu was not open during the May 1 holiday, otherwise, we would probably have been there more than once. Be warned. Restaurant is in an alleyway in a Hutong and is not easy to find. However, they must be popular because nearby shops know about 'SUSU' and can point the way. The good was fabulous. Atmosphere was cozy. You...

Sonny, the operations manager speaks very good English and is extremely helpful. The food is superb, don't be tempted to order lots of dishes as the portions are generous.

"The first time I walked up to Susu I was sure that Apple maps had led me on yet another wild goose chase. Through a rather unassuming (and unmarked) door at the end of the alley, Susu opens up into a decent sized restaurant; I like to think it's not unlike walking into the Tardis. Making good vietnamese food is...

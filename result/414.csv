"Taj pavilion has multiple branches in Beijing , my review pertains to the LIDO branch of the restaurant. The restaurant is situated in the Lido hotel. The Indian food served here is authentic Indian food - not too greasy and spicy. Quality of ingredients used is top class and the taste is amazing. Some of the well known Indian dishes...

"I had the opportunity to organise an Indian lunch for my office in Beijing, China (for around 20 people). Most of my colleagues are local and fond of Indian food. We ordered heavy portions of Chicken tikka, Karahi Chicken, Palak Paneer, Naan & Gulab Jamun. I have to commend Taj Pavilion, Guomao for their Excellent service & Delivery. The food...

"First time back after several months. The serves were much improved with much more meat in th dishes than our last visit. Curries were fragrent and delicious. Service was OK, but a smile now and then from the Chinese waiters would be nice. Definitely will be back with less of a break this time.","4 из 5 кружков","56AF62E5A6CA283208F3818D236343C3","Отзыв написан 3 февраля 2015"

"Great ambiance and the food was very tasty with delicious curry sauses. However, lacking on the meat content. The staff were friendly and helpful and the service was fast. Despite the lack of an appropriate amount of meat in the curries we will go back simply because the taste was excellent.","3 из 5 кружков","56AF62E5A6CA283208F3818D236343C3","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2014"
"I usually eat at the Europlaza (Shunyi) location. Great menu, lots of selection. The flavour does not feel as toned down as other Indian restaurants in the city. Good service, and great atmosphere.","5 из 5 кружков","601766440E1FD63EEA13EB5F0E4BC512","Отзыв написан 20 октября 2014"
"Taj Restaurant has good food; although a bit spicy; i had to have dessert- gajar halwa- just to dilute off the spices; Although- yes good proportion for one person and meal was sufficient. Will go there again- when i am in Beijing !","4 из 5 кружков","22ED462A30874299F393546DD5B40C8E","Отзыв написан 7 июля 2014"
"Great ambiance and superb service. Though it wasn't a very busy day I visited, the owner spoke with all diners individually for their feedback. The restaurant is on the first floor of an office building so not very easy to find. The food was average but when compared with other Indian restaurants in Beijing, I would highly recommend it. I...

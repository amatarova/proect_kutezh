"I had the good fortune to dine at the Jingzun Peking Duck in Beijing. It was a very nice experience. The staff is very, very efficient. Once you arrive, you are given a pocket buzzer/beeper and when your table is ready, you get a notification. It is very efficient and moves people through quickly with only a small wait time....

"Being in Beijing for 4 days, I felt the need to try the duck at least once. After some careful research on where might be good for a solo traveller, I decided on Jingzun. Unfortunately, they no longer offer the 1/2 duck (the price is still on the menu, but covered by a piece of tape). That being said, they...

"Jingzun is a very simple, unpretentious place but, out of the seven we tried, the roast duck clearly stood out as the best. Better than in fancy, expensive places, but also better than in the specialized institutions. Do not expect a vibrant atmosphere here. The restaurant is small and very unpretending. Probably better in Summer thanks to a convenient terrace,...

"There are plenty of places in Beijing to get good duck, but Jingzun is a solid choice at a very reasonable price (RMB 138 per duck, or just over $20 USD). Friendly service, lots of good sides, and convenient location in Sanlitun make it a good choice. We've been a few times and keep coming back.","4 из 5 кружков","B7C3A4D4352FC6DC0543E14DB93E42FF","Отзыв написан 2 октября 2016"
"This was so delicious. The ducks are prepared in a wood fired oven and are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. We loved it so much we ate there twice. Our dinners included a side of rice and vegetables and a duck for two, plus a bottle of white wine, all for 350 RMB which in US$...

"We ended up here because we read it on China Lonely Planet. Roast duck is delicious and it's cheaper than other restaurants (I went to Quanjude some years ago and I spent really a lot of money for a duck that was not as good as this one). The place is nice and clean, and it's not so obvious in...

"I simply love this restaurant! The food is great, especially when you go in large groups (make a reservation!) and you order many different meals so you can try a lot! Also the beer is very tasty, like the yellow beer one can order in a giant beertower! And I love the possibility to eat outside on the big terrace!...

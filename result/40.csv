"If you need a dose of good caffeine after a long day touring the forbidden city, go right as soon as you exit and visit Oasis. Menu is limited to a few coffees, 3 types of cake and 2 sandwiches.

"I've been here before a few times and had their pizza and a sandwich. Today none of that was available! No pizza, coffee, sandwich.... Only a pasta dish and meat filled appetizer. I'm not sure what the owners are thinking. Seems they are aimed toward Local and tourist Chinese. Big disappointment. Sorry but two stars today Oasis.","2 из 5 кружков","7278FA9DEF8129DA186035D78AD48F70","Отзыв написан 30 июля 2015"

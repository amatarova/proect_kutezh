"Ресторан производит впечатление элитного и немного пафосного. Хотя это ожидаемо для такого туристического места, переполненного дорогими бутиками, ресторанами и магазинами техники. Пришлось немного постоять в очереди, дожидаясь пока освободится столик на двоих. Еда понравилась, брали тофу и мясо с овощами. Место уютное, но достаточно шумное. Цены кусаются (если сравнивать с местами не расположенными в центре).","5 из 5 кружков","007C4BC2F190E2E33350E58E62FAB4D0","11 февраля 2017"

"There's a great roof terrace at this place in Taikooli shops. It's not a bad destination. The food is not great, similar prices to Lost Heaven but no where near the quality. Still if you're in Sanlitun and want some Yunnan eats in a nice space this will tick the box.","3 из 5 кружков","DE357082A3121D8100320FBE655C5640","Отзыв написан 4 сентября 2016"

"I have eaten here many times over the years. The food is good overall, but you don’t get the feeling of authenticity you get from other Yunnan restaurants, maybe it’s the location…They don’t have Yunnan cheese, which I think is CRAZY!

"This restaurant does excellent food from Yunnan, I would recommend drinking a Yunnan beer with your meal as well, it is better than a local Beijing beer for sure. The menu has a little of something for all tastes, spicy, sweet, sour, vegetarian, fish and lots of meat. An excellent choice, I go at least once a month.","5 из 5 кружков","C72C1BE52A51E88499C8AEF04E64C952","Отзыв написан 23 июня 2016"
"Just off the Sanlitun bar street, behind a I presupposing brick facade, lies this good Yunnan restaurant. The wine list is small and the ordering system is via iPad (which is not my favorite) but the food is spot on - fresh, well spiced and balanced. The Aussie beef dish was a particular standout but all the dishes we chose...

"Go here with a group that doesn't mind sharing dishes, and you can enjoy a slice of the wide variety they offer. Service is not the most attentive, and don't expect much English.

"Visited Middle 8th on a business trip to Beijing with 4 colleagues. It serves Yunan food which seems like a great combination of the different regional varieties you find in China - something spicy, fantastic pork, great fish, vegetarian - everyone loved it. The iPad menu was really cool and probably meant that we ordered more than we needed (...

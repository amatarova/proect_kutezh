"Great location in Sanlitun. Classy, i.e. dimly lit, environment. Some dishes were good but most of them were too salty for my palette.","3 из 5 кружков","978B1FAF0F1D8EB58DF42286D1E18589","Отзыв написан 17 января 2017"

"Having used this restaurant over the years and since the chef left was waiting for the replacement which seems never going to come. Service was ok but it was what was brought. The signature dish suckling pig now portioned and when mine arrived the skin was soft and a really amateaur attempt. My wife and son had the cod and...

"I was invited to Agua by my Chinese partner. Unfortunately it was not easy to find the restaurant because it is at the 4. floor. When we arrived we felled very welcome.

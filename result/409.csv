"If you want to try Asian taste of food with delicious cuisine, I will recommend you to try Khan baba, here you can enjoy Buffet as well as routine meals with very costly effective price. All good served here is pure halal and prepared with special care by Pakistani chef's.","5 из 5 кружков","B90605C343C607FAA709CA0BC27713EE","Отзыв написан 18 ноября 2016"
"Small place, neatly planned tables, all-men team manning the restaurant (atleast as i saw at the cash table and at the dining tables). Monday to Friday they serve buffet lunch; quite a filling lunch. Their dinner mostly is patronised by young chinese! Very interesting to watch a lot of young chinese especially girls walking in two's and three's for dinner!...

It was full and the owner made us wait outside. After us another smaller groups arrived (2 people, 4 people). The owner let them in. Then another group...

"Disappointed! NOT RECOMMENDED!!! Food was bad and unauthentic, Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka were utter disgrace in the name of Indian/Pakistani cuisine. Chicken Tikka Masala was better. Worst waiting staff I've ever seen in my whole life, except one youngest waiter (no exaggerations here). I can go on lengths to describe how bad it was. Try other Indian/Pakistani restaurants in...

"I discovered this restaurant during Ramadan, only 65<U+5143> for the buffet with a drink included. Lot of choices, very tasty food, and they have a flower-flavored drink (don't know what it is but sooo good too). Their restaurant in Wudaokou is bigger than the one is Sanlitun.","5 из 5 кружков","EE7C08E01FADFFE6B3A95505F771FEFA","Отзыв написан 30 июля 2015"

"Our friend took us to this restaurant. Being in China for last 2 years, i would say that i was pleasantly surprised to eat such a beautiful Pakistani meal after a long time. A little overpriced may be but in foreign land, eating your country's meal warrants a little payment i guess. would recommend it to all my friends definitely.","4 из 5 кружков","1627DF1B3AAB9F9108ABC2DB7D55A8E7","Отзыв написан 25 марта 2015"
"The location is good, being in Sanlitun, but being hidden in an office tower makes it a pretty bland location. Staff were friendly and multilingual. Food is good and has a fair price. Atmosphere is average, the design not brilliant, but it's a place where you can have a quiet meal.","4 из 5 кружков","24D6AEC5C9C7DD472A1755E6394B8BC6","Отзыв написан 17 марта 2015"
"Its tucked away on 4th floor of an office building in Soho Sanlitun. Getting there can be a bit tricky with lack of signs etc. We had buffet lunch there, it was cost and time effective. If shopping at Yashow market or Village, then one can come here for a quick, cheap halal buffet lunch.","3 из 5 кружков","E036AD73CF889F99EA98EE1A8C1A8985","Отзыв написан 9 июня 2014"
"Great Pakistani/Indian food! I know that there are not many choices for this type of food in Beijing, and I went over there to satisfy a craving for Biryani. It was so great that I ended up eating from there for the remaining two days I had in Beijing. Get off at one station east of Silk Street,( YonganLi) at...

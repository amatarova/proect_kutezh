"Reservations essential even if you are a hotel guest. Advance order of your Peking duck entree is also required as ducks are cooked to order in a large brick oven that forms part of the restaurant decor. The entire kitchen is open to view in the center of the restaurant surrounded by tables and seats at the (kitchen) bar area....

"We came for lunch after checking in at the Rosewood Hotel and the food here was great! We ordered half a Peking duck, lamb skewers and Zha Jiang Mian.

"Country Kitchen brings what all the Rosewood's restaurants offer to the customers: amazing food and a very professional service. Just because of that the place is packed all the time. Their minimalistic, but delectable dishes are the best. This lunch set menu included Kung Pao chicken, spinach leaves in sesame sauce and rice vinegar, fruits and the traditional Beijing drink:...

"A friend in NYCity had heard of Country Kitchen (that should say something about their rep as it is talked about in NYC) and suggested it. WOW! What a great restaurant, food, service, ambience, people watching etc. I will describe the food as nouvelle Chinese ie interpreting older recipes in a very innovative setting. This NOT a seven dollar meal....

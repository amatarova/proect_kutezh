"We went to this place for lunch right after visiting Drum Tower which is just 300m away. The interior decor is simple but nice with private dining rooms. The ambiance however is a more contemporary approach that doesn't really reflect the styles of the typical M'sian restaurant. Who cares anyway.. It serves authentic Malay cuisine, but the recipes are slightly...

"Many things are united here. Good food (a fusion of Malaysian and Chinese cuisine with an international touch), a place to feel good and love for details. Recommended is the creation with chicken in a fantastic sauce. Friendly service at one of the tables in beautifully furnished separees and interesting conversation partners at the bar. Everything in the typical Hutong...

"The first time we went here in our first week in Beijing we had a lovely meal and great bottle of wine.

"Came here with 4 other friends because it looked like a quiet enjoyable restaurant. We ordered the set menu for 4 and got a round of drinks.

"Came here a few times and it seems to be a bit 'hit and miss,' which considering the price it shouldn't be. Pros: - setting is magnificent - starters are really delicious. Cons: - I ordered a curry laksa, which I was told was 100% vegetarian, only to find little bit of meat swimming around. This got me particularly upset....

"It might not be the easiest restaurant to find, as it is located in a hutong of Gulou street, but its so worth it. The space itself is great, within hutong courtyard, with natural daylight through the glass roof, and two separated large private rooms. The service was attentive, the dishes were served fast enough. Laksa is definitely the one...

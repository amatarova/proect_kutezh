"Good food, good service and fare price. We ordered burgers and beers, as we were at happy hour we got an extra beer and as courtesy the waitress brought peanuts without anyone ask.","5 из 5 кружков","369DE95FBD195B3E510AD96E85104D61","Отзыв написан 2 февраля 2017"
"The Blue Frog has a nice variety of burgers in its menu. Mixing good patty with different cheeses, salads and sauces there may be one of your taste. The environment is well decorated and service is fast.","4 из 5 кружков","7A9C8C0B5801871EC63044F7D557FAA9","Отзыв написан 20 января 2017"
"I’m not quite sure what to make of Blue Frog. I think I can only describe it as the perfect example of a chain restaurant. The decor is nice enough but very conservative and inoffensive. It could well have been designed by someone who usually works with hotel room interiors. The staff are young, slightly amateurish but put some effort...

"The food here is good and there is a good selection of beers. The staff speak very little English which necessitates much pointing at the menu and gesturing, but hey, that's part of the fun of travelling!","4 из 5 кружков","97D3D15F1E8C9FBC62207842B02C1E00","Отзыв написан 5 ноября 2016"
"Had lunch at Blur Frog while staying at the Crown Plaza next door. The gourmet burger was very tasty... a bit heavy on garlic though. What impressed me most was the good and friendly service. Something that is rarely seen in China. Will return during my next visit to this part of Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","D0C5C2CC36DE26190FEDCAD605432CF1","Отзыв написан 30 июля 2016"
"We were staying at the Crowne Plaza Hotel next door, and after three weeks in China, we were craving some Western food. The mushroom burger was absolutely one of THE best I have ever tasted (we went back twice, they were so good), and they had some nice wines. (If you order a bottle, you can take what you don't...

"Good selection of western food (American really) & beers including a nice Weiss beer. Service was a little slow but food was decent & arrived in a reasonable time. Atmosphere was pleasant with plenty of young Chinese diners. Very convenient if you are staying at the Crowne Plaza, 10 yard walk. So why only 4 stars? Well, because i wasn't...

"Great restaurant, good value, and nice food. I had a burger, which was delicious, and a welcome break from Chinese food (which I love, but I'm not used to eating it 3 times a day). Very good value by Western standards. Recommended.","4 из 5 кружков","51F80B06C1F4D9798DAA92C883D27E1A","Отзыв написан 7 марта 2016"

"I ate here a couple of times 3 years ago and it was ok - food catering mainly for the Western tourist, but convenient as I was staying at the Crowne Plaza next door and some evenings I was too tired to walk far. However, when I ate here last time the food was so greasy that I left 2/3...

"After 5 days in Beijing, we longed for some western food and found it at this bar + restaurant next to our hotel. Terrific Margaritas at the bar and a two for one happy hour. We were able to get some nachos and sliders that really hit the spot. Very nice, English speaking staff. Bartender was a hoot.","5 из 5 кружков","4BFF9CE6AF77644BB84C2491CA752052","Отзыв написан 14 декабря 2015"
"We had checked into the Crowne Plaza next door and were looking for something lite. The four of us each had a different order. They arrived at the table separately with the last diner served after everyone else had finished. We only speak English and the server spoke little, so we had several communication issues. But she tried her best...

"This Blue Frog is at the entrance of U Town Mall and is one of several Blue Frogs in Beijing. I have been in Beijing for a week and have already eaten here 3 times. When you enter, you are escorted to a table by pleasant staff. The general environment is warm and welcoming. It is fairly dark inside and...

"Good food, reasonable drinks, huge selection of both. Ambience is great in the bar and restaurant - a lot of foreigners and English speaking Chinese. Happy hour 4-8pm (2 for 1), nice location and good for a stroll at The Place afterwards. Food is good size. Only negative was that my martini glass wasn't clean.","4 из 5 кружков","2ED8854A98964C545578AA080D21C4CC","Отзыв написан 20 марта 2015"
"Went here for a quick lunch before heading to airport. Menu is standard restaurant fair. Ordered the Cobb Salad and Diet Coke. Asked server to not put tomato on salad. It arrived with lots of tomato. Requested their ranch dressing Which was very watered down. When getting a refill the server brought a regular coke instead of diet. Staff were...

"I like to go there when I arrive late in Beijing, for a beer, probably a mojito (the lychee-ginger-mojito is quite likeable) and the food is as good as in any other BF, which is quite good. The service is a bit slow, and they start kicking you out at 11:30, though it's supposed to be opened until midnight. The...

"Restaurant is very popular at the lunch time because the Temple of heaven is near and our chinese friend found in Baidu that this restaurant is famous for Beijing cuisine. We stayed in the line for half an hour. The choise in menu was OK and service quite fast/ Fried mutton and stewed donkey were excellent. The nuddle of beijing...

"This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel and we liked it so much we returned for a 2nd night before we left Beijing. The duck was delicious - crispy and succulent. We also tried a range of other dishes which we mostly loved (particularly the sweet and sour options). They offered no wine so we drank beer with...

"This small restaurant is unassuming in appearance, but a large menu with glossy photos and English translations is very helpful. I've rarely seen such innovative dishes in concept and execution. Try the herb crusted lamb roast or chicken or pork...or just go. Not expensive at all. Limited drink options but can highly recommend the Chinese teas","5 из 5 кружков","F4B475AF1AAAC63DAE4118DD553DAE98","Отзыв написан 4 декабря 2016"

"Went there after a recommendation from our hotel. The diners there were mostly local, but they have English descriptions on their menus as well. Food is good, nothing incredible or vastly different from Chinese food we have at home but good nonetheless (granted we were a little less adventurous than some and stayed away from things like marinated duck heads...

"It is sometimes hard to chose the meal in China. Here you will get a nice illustrated menu with English subtitles. The meals are well prepared, tasty, nice. You can order whatever you want extra - smooth taste as well as the sharp and spicy. The salad bar is available, My recommendation and their specialty - Beijing Heaven with small...

"Really nice and affordable restaurant. Visited with our two children (ages 9 and 11) and everyone was very satisfied. Try the black pepper beef, kung pao chicken, sweet and sour soup, sichaun pork as all were delicious. Very easy to read menu and friendly staff. I would very much recommend to European and North America tourists.","5 из 5 кружков","666968B3FB146E72B3353D14FF844B63","Отзыв написан 20 июня 2016"
"We ordered the Beijing duck and a green bean dish. Also had watermelon for dessert- it's really refreshing after eating the duck. This was a great meal and we spend $70 less than we did a few nights before when we had the duck at Da Dong.","5 из 5 кружков","63B07EC588B61989B8E83264B619E926","Отзыв написан 15 апреля 2016"
"The restaurant was quite full, which is always encouraging. Lot of groups with huge fishy bowls being dipped into. Service speedy. Atmosphere more utilitarian rather than lively. You go to eat - and the Chinese always over order - so piles of food. Had, of course, Peking duck. They serve in with usual pancakes, hoisin sauce (rather than plum) etc....

"I've eaten Beijing duck earlier, at fancy restaurants that quote prices in US dollars. I wasn't too keen to spend a lot of money but was definitely craving the succulent Beijing delicacy. This restaurant was the best discovery. We had duck with all its paraphernalia, which is a meal complete in itself, but wait there was also kung pao chicken...

"We were taken to this restaurant as part of our Wendy Wu tour of China. I wasn't really sure what to expect- but this was some of the best food I've tasted. Our guide ordered for us- the Peking Duck, a chicken satay type dish, and one called 'fish scented pork' (which was an awful lot better than it sounds!)....

"I ate here as part of a group of sixteen and we had a really good time. The others all had Beijing duck and a selection of meaty dishes and really enjoyed it. I'm veggie so chose a mushroom and tofu dish - it was probably a dish for two (or a dish to be included in a banquet) but...

"I visited this restaurant for tasting roasted duck. There were 2 versions available with different features and prices: standard version costs cca. 120 yuan, while for the extra version they charged 135 yuan. Since the price difference was very small, I have chosen for the extra version. Food was much better than expected, size of the food was well enough...

"Wow, one of the best meals I had in China! I've never had Beijing duck before, but I thought theirs was heavenly!!! I don't normally eat poultry skin, but the perfectly crispy skin was delicious in the wraps. Also ordered hot and sour soup which can in a giant bowl and it was excellent. The place was standing room only...

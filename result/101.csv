"The roast Peking Duck was really nice. The best we have amongst the restaurants in Beijing. All other dishes are really nice too. You need to pre-order the duck when you make the table reservation or otherwise you will need to wait for an hour. There is no half duck you can order but it was really delicious and I...

"Very cozy Chinese themed restaurant. They actually have a real fireplace to roast the duck. They cut up the duck in front of you.","4 из 5 кружков","F67B489C874582515124AA56DCBF0BE6","Отзыв написан 5 ноября 2016"

"In a hidden location around the corner from the Legendale hotel, can be tricky to find! Set in a traditional Hutong style house, the restaurant's specialty appeared to be the Peking duck. There was however also a giant woodfire oven that almost smelt like they were producing pizzas... The duck was freshly carved up in front of the table and...

"The restaurant is set in interesting location off of the street. The decor and ambiance is classy and romantic with the tables smartly located and not overly crowded. The food was above average in quality and presentation, however I would not consider it the best value. The duck was excellent, but don't expect the variety of service that one would...

"The ambiance is sophisticated but casual and not too loud, The gong signaling arrival of the duck and the carving chef adds excitement to the experience. We had a range of side dishes, all of which were delicious. The wine list was scant, quite expensive, and in the end, local beer turned out to be the best choice.","5 из 5 кружков","08E1B3EC8E45EF6B53642D4F376F93C5","Отзыв написан 2 октября 2016"
"Just within walking distance, it is behind jin Bao centre and legendale hotel. Love the gong sound when your duck is carved in front of u. Two of us managed to finish one duck plus one well fried kale dish, loved the attention to detail even when pouring tea, the presentation of the condiments to accompany the duck was a...

"Most amazing peeking duck meal i have ever had, and trust me I've had a lot. There was little fat on the actual duck and the skin was amazingly crispy.

"I was here together with a colleague on a Monday evening it was fairly full and we were probably lucky to get a table. The venue is in a small break in one of the high streets in Beijing it is a very beautiful building in a much more traditional style than the rest of the street. Very attentive staff,...

"4-people Business dinner organized in this restaurant which has a good reputation for its Peking Duck and was recommended to us by a Chinese lawyer. The place is large and nicely decorated. We did order Peking Duck as well as a few other dishes. We all very much enjoyed the Peking Duck which is truly above the average. Other recipes...

"Good upmarket Peking duck restaurant. A place for your wedding anniversary or other special days,for this you must book. Walk in without a reservation, you will be given a (short) time to boot out. Definitely not a place for the budget conscious. There are a lot of Just-as-good Peking duck restaurants around town for much less. This is for the...

"Duck is great as was the rest of the food we had. Ambience was also great. You are paying western prices though, but if anyone can show me authentic Beijing cuisine this good in the west at a better price I would be surprised. I only don't give it 5 stars because you can eat well for a lot cheaper...

"We were recommended by our concierge to visit this restaurant to eat Peking Duck. It was the best duck we have ever tasted! The staff demonstrated how to make a pancake, described the sauces and with a bit of drama the chef carved the duck at our table. The duck was great with very little fat. The other dishes were...

"We visited on the recommendation of our hotel and were VERY disappointed. The service was poor. It took a half an hour for our order to be taken, and other than delivery of food we were ignored. Poor on them as they lost opportunities for us to order extra food and drink. I am a huge fan of traditional Peking...

"Peking duck is probably one of the most famous dishes to come out of Beijing, and what better place is there to enjoy this than 1949 The Hidden City.

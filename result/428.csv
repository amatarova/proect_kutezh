"This hotel is adjacent to Sharaton but is by far superior and priced the same. Food and beverage plus service on higher end.","4 из 5 кружков","78659DC8BA086FAE490FABDF86CAACC2","Отзыв написан 1 октября 2016"
"Clean and friendly place to stay, cheaper than the newer ones, and close to the Olympic stadium etc which is lit up at night and very pretty to walk around. We stayed 3 nights in comfortable rooms, and western breakfasts which made a nice change from eating Chinese food 3 times a day throughout our trip. Easy to visit all...

"If you are spending time at the Agricultural Expo Center, this hotel is only a few hundred meters away. It's cheaper than the Sheraton Great Wall which is right beside it. There is a few shops in old lane style indoor area. There is a cafe' restaurant beside the hotel that pretty much services the hotel guests.","3 из 5 кружков","82FA3D82E42E0D069D424C165D03DC6B","Отзыв написан 2 августа 2016"

Restaurant for breakfast was very good but getting a drink at the bar was very hard work. Not a bad location but getting around Beijing with the traffic is a nightmare wherever you...

"Well, what can I say - it is a Star Rating of 4 minus! The hotel is better than the apartment side of the building. Even at the hotel side, some rooms are tiny and uncomfortable. Definitely have to get one of the larger rooms and for sure ask for a non-smoking room. I think the breakfast is over priced...

"The hotel feels a bit dated and the room didn't feel fresh at all, bathroom was small and looked tired, only a bath with shower over it. Loby was cramped and full of guests all trying to use the wifi, which didn't function under the load. Breakfast was reasonable but again the restaurant was crammed full of people, definitely over...

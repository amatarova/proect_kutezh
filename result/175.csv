"I come to this restaurant for its Beijing duck almost every time I visit Beijing. The duck is crispy, lean but succulent roasted with traditional oven techniques with special kind of wood that gives it a sweet aroma. It beats some of the more popular but commercial roast duck restaurants by a mile and I am happy to stay with...

"I went to Beijing on business in May and September 2016. I had a business lunch at The Horizon in the Beijing Kerry Hotel. The restaurant is located on the B1 level. The restaurant is relatively quiet and you can have a good business discussion here. We had Beijing duck and it was top notch. Beijing duck, for those who...

"Horizon is a great place for dinner celebration or business. Food is very tasty and it has some premium dishes, BJ Duck standing out. It does come slightly expensive and you may find cheaper eat in BJ but once seated nothing come in fail. Not a daily place but surely a reliable one for great occasions.","4 из 5 кружков","3D5BE4EF368DC7670762620AA8C2AF6F","Отзыв написан 17 декабря 2016"

"From the moment we arrived, we were constantly pressed: order food, last call for more orders, order dessert. The service was a mess: chicken and duck arrived first, then the foie and entrees, and, before the dessert (which was not that requested), the pricy bill (300$), unrequested. The waiters did not speak English and the environment was more proper of...

"On a business trip to Beijing in Januaury of this year, we stayed at the beautiful Kerry Hotel. Since the weather was very bad, we stayed ""in"" to have Peking Duck at the Horizon restaurant. Firstly, we were seated at an unacceptable table in a near-empty restaurant; secondly, our waiters were dreadful (as in, non-existent) and thirdly, the food was...

"We were staying at the Kerry Hotel and decided to have dinner at The Horizon on one night. The service was good.

We ordered...

"The duck was passable, but you pay for set up of sauces and scallions per person, you pay for crepes, only the skin and a soup from the bones included (what happened to all the meat?), you pay for everything. Service was terrible - food coming all at once, no pacing, nobody pouring wine, no refill of water or tea...

"Went to Horizons for dinner on my visit to Beijing. The food served by the chefs were scrumptious. We didn't know what food items to have so we placed an order for a variety, from cold dishes as appetisers and hot dishes as as our mains to be shared. Omg, we were not disappointed one bit! Loved everything! We had...

"This beautiful restaurant produced the best Peking duck dinner we had in Beijing (best of three). The duck was impeccably prepared, sliced and served at the table, with the appropriate pancakes and accompaniments.

"Everything was a disaster from the beginning. The waitress had messed up my reservation the day before but rather than tell me this they seated me and kept me waiting 1hour and 20mins for the Peking duck. If you don't order in advance this is how long the duck takes! During the wait for the duck, the waitresses circle the...

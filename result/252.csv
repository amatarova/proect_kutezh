"After almost accidentally passing this place from some vague directions, we finally found this restaurant. It was well worth it! After having Chinese food for a few days we were looking for some variety. The staff were nice, the location was relaxing, and the food was exactly like an American breakfast back in the states. We would definitely come back...

"It's directly accessible from exit C of the Beixinqiao metro station on line 5. There's a good selection of traditional American offerings. The menu is in English with pictures. The food is great. The place is cozy inside. It has the atmosphere of a home dining experience like sitting in your Grandma's kitchen table. The philly cheese steak sandwich was...

"A very quaint place smacked down in the center of Beijing. Located in a hutong, Grandma's Kitchen has a nice decor and the best American food in Beijing. Service is terrible though and the waitstaff tends to ignore you.","4 из 5 кружков","E8B045B4B03619286D7213DE18DEB206","Отзыв написан 3 декабря 2012"
"We needed a break from Chinese food so came here after reading good reviews. The food did not disappoint- I had blueberry pancakes and my fiance had veg omelette w hash browns and fresh OJ. Its a little expensive (we are on backpacker budget) but for brunch was great (100 RMB). Only reason for 4 vs 5 stars was the...

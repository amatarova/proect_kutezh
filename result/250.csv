"Having been in various Japanese restaurants over the course of my travels I cannot recommend the Hatsune outlet in Sanlitun. Despite having a number of waiters at hand, their welcome desk was not staffed. The food is of medium quality and heavily priced. 6 small slices of sushi sashimi cost over 50rmb. If you compare that with e.g. Kingship in...

"Simply just the best sushi in town, and even if you are not that keen on sushi Hatsune is a great restaurant. They offer tasty salads, meats, sashimi, tempura, and other Japanese dishes. They are great for lunch and dinner but make sure to make a reservation even on weekdays. Enjoy great food.","5 из 5 кружков","B8210D34CEBDEE9C6360B5AFBDA2DC62","Отзыв написан 4 января 2017"

"This Hatsune restaurant is located in Beijing Sanlitun Village on level two. It offers Japanese dishes with some fusion flavors. It has been 4 years since I last ate here when I used to live in the Chinese capital city. It was my favorite Japanese restaurant for years in Beijing. Menu has been updated, but their ""best of"" are still...

"There are two or three locations but we prefer the one in Sanlitun. Sushi done more western/L.A. style than a much more expensive place like Nobu. Consistent value and quality. Service also usually good.","5 из 5 кружков","78659DC8BA086FAE490FABDF86CAACC2","Отзыв написан 1 октября 2016"
"This is a not-your-average sushi place in Beijing. Hatsune offer goes beyond that: Meats, sashimi, sushi, tempura, tonkatsu and other...

"It's been five years since I ordered the butterfly roll! I have dreamed about them and so could not miss an opportunity to wander down memory lane. We used to order the deluxe sushi platter for four which included two rolls. Alas that combo is no longer on the menu. We ordered mixed sushi and sashimi, butter asparagus, lovely fresh...

"Fantastic environment with great taste. The sashimi is fresh, generous in serving, melts in the mouth. Tempura is crispy on the outside, juicy inside. The sushi is beautifully made and rich in flavors.","4 из 5 кружков","4C83905C58F7A0DF7A3203D4DD06F6DF","Отзыв написан 8 июля 2016"
"The restaurant is located in the so called San Li Tun village which is the big mall complex right in San Li Tun. It is located on the third floor (Chinese style floor counting) of one of the buildings. The interior is what you would call a fancy modern loft style. Reservation in English is no big problem. We got...

"Always excellent, like the other Hatsune branches. The traditional sushi and rice dishes are good, but the rolls are what makes this place amazing. It has been around for years and is always packed, so it is a little surprising that it does not have a listing.","5 из 5 кружков","1CBFDC2C2BFFCD6FA08C288314232AE8","Отзыв написан 18 мая 2016"

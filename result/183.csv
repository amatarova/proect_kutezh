"We really enjoyed this place! Very delicious meal and inexpensive. We came during the off peak at about 3pm and had to wait for about 20 minutes. Worth the wait!","5 из 5 кружков","3CF994053935D8D6A0DAB90DDD616075","28 февраля 2017"
"Definitely an experience. My husband and I don't speak a lick of mandarin and when we do, they just look...

"Stumbled upon their smallest and original restaurant during a walk through the hutongs. Saw a lot of locals waiting for a table outside and figured it must be good. Got two girls to write down what would be the best dishes and they didn't lie. Went back for seconds and many of the tourist restaurants after this experience just seemed...

"Went here on a Lonely Planet recommendation on our first night in Beijing, and we were not disappointed. The menu is in Chinese and the staff do no speak English so we had to order by pointing at someone else's plate. However the food was very good, albeit quite spicy. And a meal for two people cost less than <U+00A3>4....

"This place is amazing! There is no English menu and the staff typically speaks no English, but that is absolutely no problem. You simply order by pointing at what people have around you and everyone is happy to help. It's definitely spicy, but in a very nice way. The biggest surprise comes when you pay - it's very cheap!","5 из 5 кружков","58FE8AC247F8225CD1B310A8AF424EC2","Отзыв написан 7 августа 2016"

"I'd been looking for a good, reasonably-priced Sichuan restaurant since I arrived in Beijing five months ago and happened to chance upon Zhang Mama on Fensiding hutong near Andingmen. Its popularity is demonstrated by the queue coming out of the door most evenings. It's a hole in the wall, but those are the sorts of restaurants I love best, keeping...

"I arrived at six, and there were already a lot of people waiting on plastic chairs on the street outside this small, loud, chaotic Sichuan restaurant. It is really a hole in the wall kind of restaurant -- very crowded and low end-style. After I arrived, the line grew even faster. The numbers are called clearly, but in Chinese only....

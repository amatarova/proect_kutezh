"I specifically like the apple strudel dessert and mozzarella sandwiches. This food is a great value in that you get a lot for the money especially on this street.

"Delicious cakes and breads. Highly recommend the cheesecakes. Breads are also high quality, loaves can be sliced free of charge after 12 each day. I think after 6pm they discount many products,","4 из 5 кружков","273B4FB975FEEFB345977418692ED28A","Отзыв написан 13 июля 2015"

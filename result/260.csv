"Me and my partner came here because we wanted Mexican/ Tex Mex food and we had seen some good reviews. However we were very disappointed when it arrived.

"Quite surprised to see a number of negative reviews about this place, perhaps something has changed recently because my two visits in July 2016 were very good. The food is very good compared to other Mexican restaurants in China, if a little pricey (70 RMB for nachos was the main concern). The staff were helpful and courteous but the star...

"This is a good spot for a casual dinner or bar snacks in the Sanlitun area. I would not bill it as Mexican food--though certainly I'd say their dishes are inspired by Tex-Mex cuisine. They have a huge menu, which I think might be to the detriment of the quality at times. The place is usually lively with diners watching...

"This restaurant was mostly visited by mistake. I wanted to try the Taco Bar but it was closed for lunch. So I walked around the corner and stumbled onto this place.

"Q-Mex offers a varaiety of Mexican statndards, along with some pizza creations. The restaurant bar offers a comfortable space with sports bar TV screens and a pool table. It tends to be a bit loud on the weekend, We thought our food was served cold, and had to send it back for re-heating (not a good sign).","3 из 5 кружков","B22583E69F45228CAC62CA0B021E1F90","Отзыв написан 25 февраля 2016"
"General observation: Do not come to China as a tourist and then eat at a Mexican/Persian/Italian/French foreign cusine restaurant; you're likely to be disappointed. Any restaurant in Beijing that is not a Chinese food restaurant is not going to be better quality than any place back home, wherever home is. Qmex is no exception. A restaurant like Qmex is appreciated...

"Average Mexican food. I'm from Los Angeles so maybe my expectations are a little higher. If your looking for a quick Mexican meal you can't go wrong.

"Went to Q Mex for a friend's birthday dinner before going out. I ordered the wet burrito, which was recommended to me by a colleague. Honestly, there was a bit too much rice for me and not enough meat (I chose the steak burrito), but everyone else at the table really enjoyed their food so it may just be that...

"I'll begin this review by saying that I've never felt the need to review an establishment online. Until now. I've lived in Beijing for 8 years. I know that service and food varies from place to place and I have VERY flexible standards. Q Mex should be ashamed of its management, service, and food. The only way they will improve...

"Ambiance: I can't seem to figure out how much this place has changed. The environment is still pretty sterile and uninviting. They added a pool table and took out the 90's art deco type of decor and updated it with a more tavern type of feel. Nonetheless not very comfortable. Service: The service was a lot better before the renovation....

"Если хотите попробовать различные мексиманские блюда, о которых раньше и не слыхивали, вам сюда. Не рекомендую брать пиво с чили - гадость невероятная. Ресторан находится недалеко от Санлитун, поэтому многие посетители европейские туристы. Из интересного - в пятницу вечером бесплатно предлагаются начос. Из минусов - возможно долгое обсулживание, даже при небольшом количестве посетителей","3 из 5 кружков","8350DBD84B6E582597676BD19B542C5E","Отзыв написан 5 января 2014"

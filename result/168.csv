"While it is great to enjoy the local cuisine sometimes you need a bit of variety and Le Cabernet provides a quality alternative. Good food and great service.","4 из 5 кружков","8D8EE5F3F76232AA732D3D21ECBDAD89","Отзыв написан 30 января 2017"
"I have eaten in many fine restaurants all ober the world. Here i found some of the best customer service i have ever experienced. Antoinne very helpfully and honestly made good suggestioms as what to choose. The food was good and reasonably prived. After the meal the staff went out of their way to make sure i got home, I...

"I had the fixed menue. The service was reasonable. The spicier and desert were fine, although unremarkable. The Salmon was badly overcooked. It was not very good. This is an expensive restaurant. For this prices the Salmon should be done properly. It's not that hard. The decor was nice.","2 из 5 кружков","1FD3C70406342CB8F4F7FF22B3B81E7F","Отзыв написан 7 ноября 2016"

"The food was good, I won't deny that, however the entire meal was quite pricey especially since the food wasn't exactly anything special (asides from the dessert). The crab bisque soup wasn't to my liking, but the pesto pasta and the prawn pasta were both very good. The deconstructed lemon tart was excellent - probably the best lemon tart I've...

"We ate here 2 nights running as it was convenient next to the hotel we stayed in and the food was faultless. The first night the service was excellent until we had dinner. We waited to have a dessert order taken but it took too long so in the end we decided against it. However the food we had was...

"We were tired of having Chinese food by now, we were here to dine and didn't expect much as didn't even think that we could find a nice French food in Beijing. Actually the foods were exceptionally nice and fresh. Service just ok but they were sure trying very hard to make us happy. A bit pricey though. However, a...

"If you just want acceptable French style food this place will do. Not too much fluff or staging. The price is still French inspired and you will need about 250 rmb per pax before wine. If you want a lol look at the artwork hanging there.","4 из 5 кружков","BAB4B1547F0756EEABEBC6F56D3E2F64","Отзыв написан 23 августа 2015"
"The food and atmosphere is very good. The place is a bit pricy but so is everything in China. We had the steak, cold cut platter, spaghetti bolognese and onion soup. All were very tasty and authentic. The outdoor patio is very nice, but the parking lot right in front spoils the view. The restaurant is open late... we had...

"The place is part of Novotel hotel. It's touted as a French restaurant but one gets pizza and pasta there too. The preparation is very good and it has a lovely place to sit out. Staff understands English and service is prompt. Not overly priced its a must go for those wanting western food.","5 из 5 кружков","F8019220AD9B302B41E412600AA0C74C","Отзыв написан 18 июля 2015"

"Le Cabernet has a friendly and warm atmosphere. Food was nice enough but not up to the standards for the price there charging. The menu comes out on an Ipad which is a bit tricky to navigate. I order the confit duck which was quite nice and the wife had steak which was cooked to order. Not all staff spoke...

"Le Cabernet used to be an excellent oasis from the normal cuisine, and although it was never a true French restaurant, it was a good choice for a decent piece of salmon. Sad to say, it has really gone down the tubes. The service was pretty poor (waiter messed up orders badly), they were out of the featured wines (but...

"it is just beside Novotel main entrance, the menu choice is quite poor and the food quality definitely not up to expectations, l'assiette landaise I had was not worth, if you are looking for good meat this is not the right place to go, there are plenty of better choices around,","2 из 5 кружков","B3FEBBCD5549E9F9205504631B3E0B43","Отзыв написан 4 апреля 2014"

"This was rather disappointing... Nothing wrong with the service - pleasant and efficient. Maybe it was my choice but based on what I had I would not recommend. The cassoulet of duck leg with pork sausage and beans was dry - both the meat and the beans (10 beans!) Rather meagre to say the leaf. Bread was OK.. butter could...

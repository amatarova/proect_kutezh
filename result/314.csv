"It's April 2016 and it looks like 'The Den' is being used as a construction office. The Den was an institution and it is sad to see it go.

"I am a regular visitor to the Den when in Beijing. The Den hasn't changed much over that time but you can still get a good choice of beers and a meal for a very fair price.

"I came here for dim sum lunch by myself and couldn't sample too many items as a result. What I had was delicious. The level of service is above the standard of all but the very best in Hong Kong. They also managed to deliver great service while being friendly and approachable. Kudos!","5 из 5 кружков","174F74D9AC55704BB86D809FF3C4570F","6 марта 2017"
"This is the Wandering Yank again. I visited this restaurant twice recently, in August and September, with co-workers (we stayed in the Four Seasons Hotel). Wow, what a nice place! Gorgeous decor, impeccable service, and outstanding food (we had Peking Duck both times, along with numerous shared entrees). Prices aren't for the faint-hearted, so don't come if you're watching your...

"In Beijing, that are a few restaurants where I feel safe to dine out, and this is one of them, on the second floor of the Four Seasons Hotel. One can be sure that quality produce, meats, other good stuff, and oils and spices are used in preparing the Cantonese dishes here. Today we had lobster wonton green Shanghainese veggie...

"Perfect for solo traveler as they offer half portion for some dishes. Services were great. I asked for suggestion of the dishes and they have gave me the right portion and tasty dishes. As I was alone, they have offered me magazine or newspaper, although not a lot of choices but I believed they have tried. Food was good but...

"В ресторане все было на высшем уровне. Еда отличная, самое вкусное блюдо - безусловно, утка по-пекински. Также советую попробовать креветки в соусе васаби - нереально вкусно и в меру остро. Интерьер очень интересный, внутри уютно. Обслуживание на высоте, все блюда приносили довольно оперативно (утку необходимо заказывать заранее, ровно за час). Также в ресторане есть обширная винная карта.","5 из 5 кружков","93AD224A6C637A9B54E8B6D9BB83B2C7","Отзыв написан 5 ноября 2015"
"Located on the 2nd floor of the Four Seasons Beijing hotel, the restaurant is beautifully decorated. Upon arriving, guests are taken down a stunning corridor before arriving at the main dining area. We had dim sum lunch at the restaurant during a weekday, but it was nearly full and the atmosphere was bustling. I have a feeling that dinner may...

"Beautiful decor, although a bit too busy, not exactly zen. Traditional dishes expertly cooked - not the most sublime or original Chinese food you could have, but certainly placing Cai Xi Yuan among the better fine dining restaurants in Beijing. Very attentive service. There are better Cantonese restaurants in the capital, but all in all this one ioffers superior value.","4 из 5 кружков","0A27D3B0E5DF97D72EDBC29C65A5184A","Отзыв написан 4 марта 2015"

"Cai Yi Xuan at the Four Seasons Beijing, proves time and time again, that is can provide, ambiance, consistency and quality.

"Certainly amazing design, beautiful setting and excellent food - dim sums and main course were delicious. The only point which was a bit disappointing was the service, we were there for lunch with a set menu being confirmed in advance, and 15 minutes after being seated still there was no food served. Then we mentioned to the waitress that we...

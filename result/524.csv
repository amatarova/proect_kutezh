"I was thinking this place would be ok because it had a salsa bar that looked appealing. That was the highlight of the food. My wife had a pina colada and hated it. She loves fajitas and ordered that. She loved the fajitas and I sampled it and it was horrible. It was grilled meat that tasted exactly like Chinese...

"During the better weather time frames here in Beijing, Cantina Agave has an excellent outside bar deck to sit, sip and enjoy your surroundings with family and/or friends! Their Margarita's aren't too bad either!","4 из 5 кружков","73FB9407242B3C0A6C370710F9CECB08","Отзыв написан 19 октября 2016"
"I ate here a number of colleagues on 2 occasions. I had the burrito on both times and it was very tasty. Service was friendly and good.

"Looking back on our 3 month trip in China, Agave hands-down had the best salsa bar (totally free with your meal). The place was hopin' on a weekend evening and had a great vibe. The prices were what you'd expect in Sanlitun and the menu had many a la carte options (single tacos, extra guac, etc). Perfect for a date...

"The food was as ordered and served in a reasonable time. It met my expectations but it was expensive for what it was. The staff were very good. They took orders quickly and made sure we got our food and drinks through the evening. The reason for two stars is partly value for money. For a restaurant in this quality...

"I really like this place, compared to all other ""Mexican"" restaurants in the city, I think they have by far the best cuisine and tequila. Their sangria is the best in the city! I've been here with small parties and big ones, the service has always been pleasant. Highly recommend it.","5 из 5 кружков","4BFC6B3CAA8451C544AE009C516186AF","Отзыв написан 9 февраля 2016"
"Stopped in for lunch at noon on a Tuesday and it was absolutely dead. Not a great sign I thought. Besides myself there's one party of 5. However I was pleasantly surprised by the good food. Unfortunately since I had to drive I cannot vouch for their margaritas. I had the Pasilla Tortilla Soup which was nice and a Machaca...

"We rocked up to Cantina Agave late on a Friday night and shared bowls of nachos, dips etc.. We indulged in Margaritas and had a fine time. To me, this is a really easy venue to meet, eat and drink. In a city with little, real Mexican food, this is as close as I've come to authentic Mex. Everything we...

"Visited Sanlitun Street district and popped in here on our way to Tairyo Restaurant, 3rd floor. Being very cold In November, it was not busy so the staff were very attentive. Great cocktails. Nice ambience & good music. Nicely decorated. We didn't eat here. I should imagine it's very busy in warmer weather and we would come here again.","5 из 5 кружков","6C5B6A8F03A11B27AC451A354A6179D0","Отзыв написан 16 ноября 2015"
"Visited recently for a late lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The food was cooked to order, affordable and good quality. It was mostly empty and the service was fine. Regarding their service--to get great service in a restaurant in China can be a quest. It is simply the general rule that food is served when it is cooked and most...

"We visited the restaurant for the dinner. Even though it was not really busy, the service was really slow. Our orders did not come at the same time, one by one. At the end of the dinner, 3 of us had to wait for our 4th family member to finish her dish.","3 из 5 кружков","C679DFFC2ABA7172AD2255378D0ACAA0","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2015"

"We were looking for a change of pace from Chinese Food. We looked around and headed here. It is a sneaky location on the 3rd floor or the shopping mall so you need to look for it.

"Let me start with my only criticism, because other than that, everything is GREAT. OK, the only criticism is that it's too cold in the winter.

"I have been to this place several times. I have lived in Mexico and in Dallas, Texas, so I am picky about Mexican food.

"This is pricy for Beijing, but normal for Sanlitun. Best Mexican food I've had in Beijing by far! I just had the tacos and guacamole, but they were so delicious that I'm sure the rest of the menu is the same. Also, the passionfruit margaritas, so good! The only bad thing is that it started raining while we were eating...

However the food was cold, they forgot one...

"With great potential [there are very few options for Mexican food in Beijing, especially that are good], this place lets itself down somewhat.

Our table was satisfied, and even after...

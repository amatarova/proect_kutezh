"Could never imagine that one would find a dedicated vegetarian restaurant in Beijing! One is spoilt for choices even though the food is not exactly Chinese. There is a substantial overlay of Thai, Indonesian and Vietnamese influence on the cooking with spices and mixing of cooking proportions, including the use of coconut oil! The food is however quite delicious and...

"We often wonder why asian vegetarian cuisine in Germany is more or less average... and we really wished we could have this restaurant back home. It would be without a doubt one of my reasons to come back to Beijing. Groceries are fresh, the tofu is stunning and the sauce is .... heavenly. We shared one main dish and two...

"We found this restaurant by comments on Tripadvisor. Only one of our group (8) is a vegan but the rest of us were game for trying it.

"One thing that took me a while to learn in China, is that 99% of the time, when something/somewhere says vegetarian, it means VEGAN to Westerners, it's just that the word vegan hasn't quite made it across to China yet.

"We ate an excellent dinner at this Buddhist-run restaurant.

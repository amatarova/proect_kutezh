"Does an excellent job of catering to tourists. They do a really good steak, although it is a little in the pricey side. It is not worth going for any deals, order exactly what you want. You will end up with smaller portions if you go for the deals. The wifi is very good and the owner speaks English and...

"It's our second time eating here. We came back because of their fish & chips! For RMB 108 (May 2016), it's the best fish & chips that reminds us of England! Big portion of fish, enough for 2 people with average eating portion. Averagely, their food is rather pricey, but taste-wise, they are not bad. We tried the green salad...

"I was walking in the Salitun area and came across this restaurant that advertised hamburgers. I was in the mood for the same and I must admit that I enjoyed a very tasty, made the way that I like, burger. It was garnished as requested and cooked the way that I ordered it. The waitress was very pleasant and efficient....

"I was looking for an Hamburger and fries and I decided to try this place because the menu seemed nice. Actually, the place is really nice (London town recall)and the staff too. I choose a classic hamburger but 100% angus Australian beef, because the ordinary one is a mix of beef and lamb meet that I didn't prefer. Very good...

"Why did I live in Beijing near this place for over a year before trying it last December? Since then, I have been about a dozen times! Fresh ingredients, great managers, great food and cosy atmosphere. The house red wine is a generous pour and very good. Their salads are all great but my fav is the grilled chicken salad...

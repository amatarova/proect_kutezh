"It was a nice sunny day in Beijing . I was in the mood for some beers over lunch. This place hit the spot. Great selection of beers . The Honey Ma beer was tasty. So we're the cheese and bacon burgers. Will come here again.","4 из 5 кружков","1771BBFBE49A3A88D203D7645689F5AF","6 марта 2017"
"I didn't try the beer as I have quit but my wife tried a, recommended by the waiter, beer and she loved it. Sorry I forgot the name of the beer but she actually had 2 and drank them both which is something she never does. I had a basic burger and it was pretty darn delicious. I even enjoyed the salad. The fries could have been a bit crispier but in any case my wife enjoyed her burger meal as well so we were both content with the atmosphere on that Sunday afternoon. We will stop again if in the area.","4 из 5 кружков","D025F0501EF9BD8FB17FF52AA004760A","4 марта 2017"
"#12 is generally very busy. The food is extremely delicious & it's always fresh. For a Western gastro-pub it's very well priced: both for food & drinks. The space has an industrial feel, its clean & the staff are well-trained. There are tons of home-brewed beer options, 2 really good options of house wine, and plenty of mixed drinks to choose from. They don't do pizza at #12 (only at #45). The Great Leap franchise is run really well & it's a relaxing place to hangout, eat amazing food & unwind a bit in a crazy city. Highly recommended.","5 из 5 кружков","A4AF6E66E4C17AD367BF5F65D15C3362","15 февраля 2017"
"It's comfortable, friendly, and affordable here. They have wifi and the best burgers around. I'm not a beer connoisseur so I go for the 25 Rmb pilsner and sip it while enjoying the tasty burger and perfectly cooked French fries. I also get to catch up on my internet. This is a great place.","5 из 5 кружков","207B1B94E6EEA82546E436899B39B352","14 февраля 2017"

"I have lived in China for almost two years now and this is the best restaurant I have found for American style hamburgers and pub grub. It has always been busy when I have visited.The service is also good for China, which is not always the case in general. I am not a huge fan of beer, but their microbrews are also very good. I went there with my son, but he is always the only child I see, so I would not say it is a great place for families.","5 из 5 кружков","34B09066A9B98A3F287388D86A19DF5D","Отзыв написан 17 января 2017"

service was friendly and well paced. Great place to go after trying the local foods.","4 из 5 кружков","417CD72D533397668C0FE4A2F68A57A3","Отзыв написан 1 января 2017"
"I have tried their various burgers, the knife and fork sandwich, chicken sandwich and the cobb salad. I have never had a bad meal. All the beers I have tried are pretty good. The banana one is dangerously good, but also fairly expensive, so that will keep people in check. I really like the cinnamon ale and the stout best. Service isn't awesome (it's still China), but far better than many other restaurants, many which charge more.","4 из 5 кружков","6266EBB843D005DDC98D372B6249C615","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2016"

"Had a few beers and dinner here on a recent business trip to Beijing. The Great Leap Brewery is a little out of the way and if you have not been before it could be a little hard to find, however it was definitely worth the search. Loved the industrial decor and concrete ceiling. The place was pumping, which for a week night was a pleasant surprise. Beers were very good and the pub grub was above typical China standards. Appears to be well frequented by Beijing based expats which is always a good sign. Definitely worth a visit if you have a night in Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","BCCF944E2FB8B83CA21E0FF47F71F075","Отзыв написан 16 ноября 2016"
"We go here for the burger not the beer. I usually order gin & tonic here cuz I don't drink beer and it is good but please use more tonic.. seems like one of those cheep places that serve more alcohol in the mixers cuz it is cheaper than the tonic.. anyway it is a beer place so I am keeping this in mind. The place gets super crowded and can be a nightmare to get seats so better be here early..","5 из 5 кружков","269FCAD9F3A7CF22275A6B0997202058","Отзыв написан 11 ноября 2016"
"This spot was very busy the night we visited as it is probably every night. Great place to get a burger and beer. Eating a greasy bacon cheeseburger was a nice break from Chinese. The house fries are awesome, light and crispy. There is a good variety of unique beers to choose from. I ordered a flight and all four samples were fantastic.","5 из 5 кружков","83795B7B11F0233596E42001453FC4BD","Отзыв написан 4 ноября 2016"
"This is a great choice for a dinner with friends or a few beers after work . The chicken wings and sweet potato fries are especially good . This place gets very busy so my advise is to try and get there by six to reserve a table of reserve one by phone first .","5 из 5 кружков","30C7F9E9D2FE49EA3033418FDE622925","Отзыв написан 2 ноября 2016"
"Visited this spot dying on a hang over. I was ready to ravage the city of Beijing, nay the greater Beijing region, for some decent Western food.
I wasn't disappointed. It was the best burger I've had in a very long time. I took one bite of my cheeseburger and I entered a parallel universe. All of a sudden I was galloping down the crest of a rainbow on a golden unicorn. Fireworks exploded, tidal waves crashed and dragons roared as I shimmied and swayed in my new found ecstasy. I may have passed out at some point but thankfully Al Green came to my rescue. He said, Ciara it's not your time just yet. Run away from the light of the tunnel, as fast as you can into the darkness. I ran and I ran as fast as fast as my little legs would take me back to reality where I finished my glorious cheeseburger.
Seriously though it's a bloody good burger.","5 из 5 кружков","30EA3A59A3CA507BC42101C1CCAD812F","Отзыв написан 31 октября 2016"
"Good atmosphere, great choice of beers (if rather expensive) and tasty food. The staff are really helpful too. Very busy - perhaps best to book. We tried to go a second time without booking and couldn't get near the place at about 7.30pm (and on a Thursday!) OH recommend the ""Chesty Puller IPA.""","4 из 5 кружков","3DE5624369A712772DB44F1FAE62F2D0","Отзыв написан 31 октября 2016"
"This place has a great atmosphere and the choice of beer was massive. The food looks fairly straightforward burgers and salads, and some of our party ate and said it was brilliant and certainly just what they wanted after a week of eating Chinese food twice a day! If you're in the area, search this place out. Kids are welcome and the you're made to feel super welcome.","4 из 5 кружков","0C71BDEEA9833F8090504F53303824F8","Отзыв написан 30 октября 2016"
"Yet another visit to The Great Leap and my first impression still last!

"What can I say, after 2 years of coming to Beijing I finally made it to the Great Leap.

The beer: You can have the standard ""half meter"" , which is 4 samples of your choice of beer. They have 13 or so of their own brews plus a couple of guest beers. Not all were available on the night but thats because of what they had brewed recently I guess. To make it simple I had numbers 1 to 4. All excellent. It made a welcome change to the craft beer places in London in that the beers were not ""cloudy"" when they aren't supposed to be. (In London they try to tell that all craft beers are supposed to be cloudy - no way).

Food: They have a range of burgers - doesn't sound exciting but they are really tasty and hit the spot - excellent

Atmosphere: It's a noisy place as you might expect with lots of chatter going on. You can sit at the bars or at tables that seat up to 8. If there is less of you than that, you are expected to share - no problem there as everyone is there for the beer.

A great place for a night out.","5 из 5 кружков","6F6824984FEBDAEE5940EE58A6E09D8A","Отзыв написан 7 сентября 2016"
"A lot of people take their burgers seriously in Beijing, with the Beijing publishing a yearly ranking. GLB always scores highly on the board, but in mine and my friends opinion its the best! This is down to the vast selection of beers available and the locality to both SLT and Gonti before a night out.","4 из 5 кружков","71B0E3D4DDCAD514D51B3CC6694CEEB5","Отзыв написан 25 августа 2016"

"Went for beers and burgers with the family! Hands down the best burgers in Beijing, highest price is 60 rmb for a bacon cheese burger (10 rmb extra for a side salad). If you go during the week for lunch 11-2:30 buy a salad or a burger and get a free drink (beer included). You won't get a better burger unless you travel back to America!","5 из 5 кружков","E47A10AAA7EE52C02CC2DD140452D912","Отзыв написан 19 августа 2016"
"A western oasis in the land of noodles and rice. Great beers. I like the illigitimate general. Great burgers, wonderful pork belly, and grilled chicken. Once I found this paradise I returned 4 times in 5 days before I left Beijing. I ordered the fried chicken appetizer with a salad to take back to my hotel for dinner.

"For a birthday, we tried to book a table for 18 people at Great Leap. Their burgers, to me are the best in town, the atmosphere is great, why not!?
No such luck my friends, Great Leap isn't so welcoming when it comes to large groups. I understand, I worked in tourism man. for many years, sometimes large groups are more work than they are worth. BUT don't accept the reservation, then call back to change your mind. They pretty much did anything is discourage us coming, which included suggesting we come and sit at the table an hour before we wanted to eat. It really was disappointing seeing how their burgers are just so tasty!","4 из 5 кружков","9AF671EAC413537F4F4092EE7E4A52BA","Отзыв написан 27 июля 2016"

"Great leap #12 is usually always packed with foreigners who go for the beer and burgers. Admittedly, their burgers do do the job when you're craving some greasy American food, but they are extremely greasy. It is definitely not the place to go id you're watching your figure... Also, it gets very, very loud at night, it is actually awful to sit there if you want to have a conversation. However the servers are friendly and speak English. It's worth a visit if you're rrrreally craving fast food and beer. Price wise it's alright, pricier than local foods but not the worst.","3 из 5 кружков","1F76458768A7282687E22A350823BD72","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2016"
"When I first arrived in Beijing, & experiencing all the Local street food & Peking Duck, I craved for Burgers, not those MC Donald's or KFC types but juicy Agnus beef with melting Cheese type Burgers.
When I shifted to Dongzhimen, lucky Great leap was just 7mins walk behind my Apartment compound, & that was the start of a Love Affair never ending.
Great leap has vast variety of Root Beers, Burgers, Sandwiches & the best Onion rings you'd find anywhere; at least that's what My taste buds tell me..
Usually on weekends this place is super crowded , so better reserve before you go otherwise prepare to wait for sometimes. Oh yes, Great leap has Brunch as well on Sunday, I still opted for Burgers but friends told me it was good enough for the money being paid. :)","4 из 5 кружков","121E2D91CE71D4A5A2415D915CF18ADE","Отзыв написан 5 июля 2016"

"I've been in China for 6 months now and the closest thing to an American style burger has been McDonalds...yeah I know right? I sought this place out. Maybe it's because I don't live in Beijing or maybe it's because following directions and streets in China can be nearly impossible, but this place was VERY difficult to find. I had a nice craft beer and bacon cheeseburger that was absolutely delicious!!! I will be coming back for sure the next time I am in Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","E1F984DC837845509BAD8547ED7B2CEA","Отзыв написан 1 июля 2016"

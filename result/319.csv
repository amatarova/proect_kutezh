"We wanted to visit the China World Trade building (currently the tallest building in Beijing) and enjoy the view from the 80th floor Lounge restaurant. The service was friendly and efficient. There were many options on the menu - we selected from the ""Oriental"" dishes and were delighted with our selections. The desserts are exquisitely crafted and the tea menu...

"We use to love going for a Cocktail here, service was fabulous and the cocktails were fun and interesting. We were there this weekend found the prices have gone up even more, the service was terrible and the atmosphere has really changed. Not as much fun but the view is still amazing.","3 из 5 кружков","A812176C2F8EEFB5339FA232A309A6D1","Отзыв написан 21 марта 2016"

"One of the nicest lounges on a tall building rooftop. The lounge is very cosy and offers great cocktails and tea, the snacks on the menu serve as very nice accompaniments. The best seats are along the Windows, the ushers talk about a 200 Rmb per person minimum order but at the end are a little flexible. The view from...

"I often take visiting friends to the lounge on the 83rd floor of the WTC. The views of the the city and CCTV underpants building are great. The burger meals are delicious and not too badly priced. We have found other dishes to be small though and expensive, as are drinks. 58RMB for a can of coke!!!? Stick with burgers...

"Nice lounge with good views of Beijing from high if there is no smog. Nice breakfast with good western and chinese dishes. Friendly and helpful staff making getting up early in mornings better. Recommend you ask the staff to ask chef to make you their special omelete if you have time to enjoy breakfast.","5 из 5 кружков","68DDEBD1596AB294E987594555B793B4","Отзыв написан 25 августа 2015"

"This is a lounge especially fit for people in courtship. Looking out from the tall glass windows guests can admire the good views outside - air quality and weather permitting, though. Its drinks are not cheap, but its setting is rather romantic and impressive.","4 из 5 кружков","2DCBD871CEA3E6D4175A35EF0B542759","Отзыв написан 22 апреля 2014"
"Normally, when you want to go to the top of a tower you pay to for entrance. Here you don't pay entrance, but instead you get entrance and one or two cups of coffee for the same price. One cup of Capo chino is 10 Euro. View is of course spectacular and you get the music from a live piano...

"Found this gem by accident at the end of our night, and headed up to the 80th floor, which the lounge is located. It was an amazing end to the night, starting from the beautiful scent as you walk in, great drinks and exceptional service. We felt very welcomed and comfortable. Price was not so bad, if you compare if...

"The lobby bar in the China world. While the overall hotel was great, this was just OK. Sort of noisy, typical big city / big hotel high prices for drinks. Fine to meet someone, or for a quick drink, but not for hanging around all night","3 из 5 кружков","40408F76C49186189A4396774A2CC4AD","Отзыв написан 6 ноября 2012"

"This place guarantees great views of Beijing as it is on the 80th floor of China World. However, I was disappointed as the windows are dirty thus it is not great for photos. The atmosphere at the lounge is great, and the service is very good. Drinks are very expensive. A small glass of orange juice is 85RMB!! However, the...

"Near Ritan Park. I came in for lunch on 1pm Tuesday, and took the buffet lunch. You can still order from the main menu if not interested in the buffet, but I suggest you take the buffet. It includes 1 drink. Though limited in how many drinks, you are allowed unlimited visits to the buffet line. The food is delicious....

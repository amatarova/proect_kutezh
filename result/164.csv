"This is amazing and very interesting food. All vegetarian, some also vegan. The Ipad makes ordering fun and the service is pretty friendly. The tofu strips are highly recommendable. Just wished they also had beer. Do buddhists not drink beer?","5 из 5 кружков","A6B0A01C69EC559B50D6DBF74E156AAA","Отзыв написан 27 июля 2016"

"I was pleasantly surprised with this quirky restaurant. I did enjoy the iPad menu and the service was attentive especially to top up my mug of Chinese tea.

"Stumbled upon this place looking for another vegetarian spot & thought I'd check it out----so glad I did! At first the elegant decor screamed pricey, but it was actually quite modest. Definitely worth the 6-stop subway ride (Beixinqiao or Dongzingmen station, walk to Dongzingmen Nanxiaojie---you'll see the lit sign in English ""VEGETARIAN"" on the southeast corner).","5 из 5 кружков","8F1EA7C3486FB7B7B6DB8850C9A31F4D","Отзыв написан 10 июля 2015"

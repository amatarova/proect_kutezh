"Dined here for lunch on a sunday afternoon on 21 Dec 2014, it was one of the best and most delicious hot pot/shuan yang rou places I've been! Though it cost around 200 yuan because the pot itself cost 100 yuan or so, the sauce that they offered were the best in the city!! Services provided were very professional, and...

"The restaurant was full and we had to wait for quite some time. No worries, women get their nails done for free - a great trick that should be imitated by others. The food was great, the selection of salads and meats is huge and the atmosphere is superb. Highly recommended!","5 из 5 кружков","D862DEBC2B67A2A9EC0EC3D6D836A83A","Отзыв написан 5 октября 2016"
"We had wonderful family dinner at HaiDiLao Hot Pot. We went to both places in Beijing. They were fabulous. The best services with very delicious food.

"These guys are great in all of their locations ( they have many). They do a hotpot that is always guaranteed. They are consistent with fresh ingredients and friendly service. If anyone is coming to Beijing and wants to try a style of food from the far southwestern SIchuan province, look no further. Ask for MALA soup to boil your...

"I used to live in Beijing and Haidilao was a family favourite so when back in town on business couldn't miss the chance to go back. Things have definitely got easier with an iPad based menu (English option available) and all the great food I remembered. We ordered 2 different broths - a spicy and a mushroom - then kept...

"While the hotpot at Haidilao is delicious, it's really all about the service and extras at Haidilao. The staff are all trained to be extremely outgoing and helpful. And while you wait for a table, or after your meal, you can be treated to a ton of extras. At this Mudanyuan location, you can get your nails done (gel manicure,...

"For a chain restaurant this place is excellent. Its certainly not the exact same as the hotpot that you would get in Chengdu or Chongqing but it certainly gets the job done.","4 из 5 кружков","FC77773A1D74AB1A7651D3576EE93232","Отзыв написан 29 декабря 2015"
"Heads up, hot pot may likely cause bathroom issues later... But it's so worth it. This place is the best of the best for reasonable prices.

"I had the pleasure of eating at Haidilao Hot Pot (Mudanyuan) restaurant in early August. Two coworkers insisted on taking me out to this famous Hot Pot restaurant.

"This is a must try in Beijing. The food is very tasty and also very inexpensive. The locations central and the restaurant itself is stylishly decorated. The service here was fantastic!

"The service of this place one of the best I have ever experienced in hotpot restaurants around the world. Watch out for their speciality noodles. A guy will perform some kungfu moves just to prepare the house speciality noodles for their customer.

"We stumbled on this our first night in Beijing. (More or less--you can't easily stumble on a place high up in a mall.) It's so popular they offer manicures, kid's art projects, board games to waiting customers--a promise of the great service they provide. The hot pot is fantastic, with a great array of ingredients to put together your own...

"For those of you familiar with hot pot, one of my favorite things is the nutty flavored sesame dipping sauce. Haidilao has a whole bar where you can create your own concoction! It's really amazing, and unlimited watermelon doesn't hurt either. The service is phenomenal and they always provide you with hot wash clothes, not sure what they are for,...

"If you come to Beijing, you must go to Haidilao.

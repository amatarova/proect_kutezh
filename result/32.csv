"Grandma's House is a super popular restaurant and is one of the most popular restaurants on DianPing (Chinese Yelp) in Beijing. It's located in the APM mall in the main Wangfujing area. Unlike in the US, malls don't just have crappy fast food or chain restaurants. In China, a lot of nice restaurants are located in malls. I wouldn't recommend...

"Arriving the restaurant was closed for an hour uncertain why. A huge crowd of customers gathering outside and they filled out their orders to be gathered when entering.

"Grandma’s House is located in the APM Mall in Wangfujing Street. If you are taking the subway to Wangfujing, it is located on the far end of the street. If you take a taxi, then they’ll drop you off very near as taxi’s aren’t allowed on the subway end of the street. If you are worried about safety and or...

"Don't let the shopping center fool you, Grandma's isn't a standard mall food at all. Great service, good atmosphere and fantastic Chinese food for few bucks. Free hot tea is available for people waiting and during the all meal. We order 4/5 different dishes and we spend only 20$ for both of us. Great dinner","5 из 5 кружков","8DEF67EA0DBD7C396C71747C75A120E0","Отзыв написан 29 декабря 2016"

"The restaurant is on the sixth floor of the mall above the Apple Store. Similar to the Cheesecake Factory, for those who know it, you get a number and wait for a table. The wait is obviously determined by how many people came before you. They have one English menu, it has pictures, everything else is in Mandarin. There are...

"The long queue (50 minutes) makes you think you're in for something special, but the food is unremarkable at best, and feels like it's just been taken out of a microwave (which I'm 90% sure is the case).

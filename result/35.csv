"Nice decor, superbe service - they bring the Peking duck to your table with elaborate arrangements, slicing it it in front of you, excellently prepared. The only problem was that although we did make a reservation for 19:30h, we were not seated until 20:10h.","4 из 5 кружков","F2B56D23F4AEBFBF2B4EF67E266FA3F0","Отзыв написан 5 февраля 2017"

"We went here for a friend's going away dinner. It is a lovely duck restaurant if you prefer fine dining. I have been to lots of other duck places that aren't as fancy and the duck is equally as good or better. If you had a celebratory dinner or business dinner/lunch and you wanted the ambiance, then I'd go. It...

"I've been to this restaurant twice. Once in a private room and then in the regular dining room. Both times have been outstanding! I love the decor especially the cool sculptures in the courtyard. The waitstaff was incredibly helpful. Our hosts had ordered the day before and the food kept coming and coming! It was all so great too!","5 из 5 кружков","9F86A2770CDF995A21D14A98DDCD89B6","Отзыв написан 28 декабря 2016"
"My first <U+5317><U+4EAC><U+70E4><U+9E2D> during my last trip to Beijing was at Duck de Chine. My friends and I noticed that there were a lot more foreigners than locals, probably because of the reviews by Timeout and Beijinger (which we also read). The restaurant is on the pricier side, and there was a lot of emphasis on presentation. Most of the...

"This restaurant is hidden behind Pacific place building in Sanlitun area in a modern brick hutong surrounded by art galleries. On the menu, you will find Chinese and Beijing food, including the famous Beijing roasted duck. Probably, one of the best duck you can find in Beijing with more famous Dadong & Quanqude restaurants. Please note that all these 3...

"First off, be aware that there are TWO locations for this restaurant. They both serve the same menu in the same way, but double check which one you've reserved. Going to Beijing meant, of course, sampling the famous Peking Duck, and this place had the best review in Fodor's. It's all served with great theatricality; they cart out the duck,...

"A little hesitant going as some reviews are significantly differing in opinion. We had a beautiful evening there. Service was efficient but unobtrusive, duck (which was pre ordered by the hotel concierge) was sublime - the skin dipped in sugar just melted in your mouth. Wine list was extensive and well priced for China. We paid around $200 AUD total...

"I was recommended to this restaurant by my hotel. Peking Duck wasn't the best, just average. The ambience was certainly exquisite. Service was also good.

"This restaurant having been recommended is in a wonderful setting. A vaulted old industrial building that has been fabulously renovated. The duck was delicious however the service wasn't wonderful. This is an expensive restaurant and the staff were not particularly interested in supporting a positive experience. Also note, every component of the Peking duck meal is charged seperately.","3 из 5 кружков","354C2F9510CCB106C26902194E066F8E","Отзыв написан 9 ноября 2016"

"in Beijing, you are bombarded with a thousand and more Peking duck.

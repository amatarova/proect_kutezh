"Very friendly staff, very nice food but pricy. We had our dinner here upon arriving in Beijing and the restaurant lived up to our (high) expectations. Unfortunately it's rather pricy (which was probably also the reason why it was relatively calm in the restaurant). Tip (but this is for all restaurants in China): don't take a menu but order your...

"I need to preface this by saying I don't particularly care for duck. That is, duck in general, not Peking duck in particular.

"We ate here but had just arrived in Beijing and were still feeling a bit tired from our flight and we were not that hungry.

"Staying in the hotel, and feeling lazy on the first evening we dined here. Prices are steep, service is great, dishes are refined. The duck was not up to the standard of Dadong (JInbao Place) which we enjoyed a couple of nights later. That said, hard to go wrong here - it's a safe choice.","4 из 5 кружков","789D0A57B5B0EF67B961418F22FF9119","Отзыв написан 10 августа 2015"
"I read the reviews on trip advisor and decided this was the place for duck in Beijing. I've eaten duck at the more typical duck restaurants where you sample all the unusual bits like beak and feet and not been impressed. This place was a little bit of luxury and refinement and the duck was superb. Don't go if your...

"We enjoyed the famous PekingDuck at Chynna restaurant. The service was friendly and attentative without being pushy or ""all over"". Somewhat higher priced than other good places, but the restaurant is beautifully decorated with original art.

"Best Peking Duck I've eaten - (note you need to give 1 hour notice so order before you arrive). Served with crispy skin, lean breast and leg meat all on separate plates and 5 delicately flavoured pancakes (like caraway etc). Good service and nice ambiance in the restaurant as well.","5 из 5 кружков","726180C6A78D3EDCEF84C1B9A05B6E7B","Отзыв написан 24 октября 2014"

"A good option in the area flooded with tourists from far and near. The place is quiet, connected to the hotel bar and other hotel restaurants. Good quality Cantonese cold and hot dishes. The soup taste bland and at RMB75, it is not worth the money. The dessert looked nice but taste average.","3 из 5 кружков","0AD2A2E6AB242E82B3FD6E01C998EA87","Отзыв написан 19 июля 2014"

"For many westerners it is not all too easy to dine Chinese in China. Chynna is a great choice of restaurant. They serve classic authentic Chinese food, in a modern style. What it means, is that it all tastes great, and that you avoid the worst dishes you dont want anyway...

"There are better places to eat, so do go explore. But if you are tired and don't want to brave the streets of Beijing, if you are staying at the Hilton or near by, this is a good restaurant.

"Often hotel restaurants are average and over priced. If you don't order wine or crazy French water this restaurant won't disappoint. Beijing duck as exceptional and the attention to detail is excellent. Staff are friendly and for a high end gig the price of the dishes is reasonable. Both visits in the last year have been solid performances.","4 из 5 кружков","53AB8A8AB39E8C977877B78B4F725A19","Отзыв написан 18 марта 2013"
"We enjoyed a reasonably tasty meal here. The setting is lovely. The servers are VERY attentive. Think hovering. But, the absolutely INSANE thing was that for a large bottle of water, I am talking about Evian water, not water that sings or does a dance or tells jokes - they charged $16. That's more than one of our appetizers and...

"That'd be my rating if I could. The service was excellent, with a beautiful waitress literally hovering over my table the entire dinner. That was a little unnerving and made me feel rushed, though I know that wasn't the intention. It should be noted that I went there around 8pm in the evening, and there was only one other person...

"Beijing is not exactly known for steakhouses, but meat lovers may enjoy this casual spot. Mostly Chinese beef cuts (and some Australian offerings now, I believe), ordered by weight. The standard serving comes with frites and salad--bistro style. They have other options on the menu (lamb, some seafood; salads; etc), but why bother when you know you are coming here...

"Atmosphere was very laid-back and casual. Nothing pretentious. Steak was delicious and whatever size you order, it'll be bigger than you'd expect and cooked to perfection. The side salad leaves much to be desired and they serve the steak with french fries. Hey, what I can I say except this is China!! lol But for China, the steak is outstanding!","4 из 5 кружков","1D65B3666287A567378E75F33B94FBA8","Отзыв написан 17 мая 2016"

"The biggest problem with the steak is that the meat quality is just so so, these are not the best beef even for standard in China. Salads are good, not super neither. The waitress are nice, but the house wine, Syrah , at 248 cny per bottle is another huge disappointment, less than average and served at wrong temperature (...

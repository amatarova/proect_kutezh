"My friends and I have visited this location many times now over the past 4 months. It all starts with the beer, which is outstanding, not only for Beijing, but comparable to anywhere I've been in the US. Please, do yourself a favor and order one of their homemade sausages. The siesta is my favorite, made with chorizo. The bread...

"Visited in winter so did not avail myself of the rooftop. Reckon it would be pleasant looking across the river. Maybe next time. Great to see another Beijing brewer expand. Much bigger site than the original and a nice range of beers. Comfortable seating, good wifi and a solid menu of US style food (tacos, wings). Didn't eat but enjoyed...

"Only got to this place a couple of times but the on tap beers are worth it alone. However the lunch special with homemade sausages was fantastic! Recommend visiting at lunch over dinner.","4 из 5 кружков","835C12B2D05A1AF71DCD798BC71B2B9D","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2016"
"With Beijing lagging in the global development and interest in craft beer (i.e., my own town of Tacoma has more than 12 alone for a city of 200,000), it's good to see new sites in Beijing. There are certainly enough of us ex pats and visitors, and it's also great to see many locals expanding their taste buds beyond the...

"Made a pilgrimage to this spot during Beijing's craft beer week, is a little off the beaten track but well worth a visit. Lots of seasonal brews to try and a lovely rooftop terrace. Highly recommended, I didn't eat so can't comment on food.","5 из 5 кружков","05E278E8B39218DC19259F69F5049DD0","Отзыв написан 10 октября 2016"

"This is a good place to unwind after a day at work or simply to enjoy a wide selection of craft beers and a wide choice of western-style food, including several vegetarian choices. The prices for the food and drinks are reasonable and include a discount on drinks during happy hours in the late afternoon.","4 из 5 кружков","687E8BE60C2D86C06C90393DAC0C0ABA","Отзыв написан 4 июля 2016"
"Nice craft beers, good food. Location has exposed brick, high ceilings, nice ambiance but can be quite loud when busy.","4 из 5 кружков","C6FA82F70EDE56BD97FF3FDDFD1C695B","Отзыв написан 25 июня 2016"
"Located on the banks of the Liangma river, Arrowhead offers a line of craft brews all freshly made on the premisses. Their ""Seeing Double IPA"" is one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted. The venue has 3 levels. The ground floor is the brewery, The second floor is the main tap room, and 3 floor offers an outstanding outdoor...

"Trendily renovated in industrial hipster chic, this small bar/microbrewery is a bit away from other bars and restaurants in the Dongzhimen/Sanlitun area. If you are looking for somewhere quiet that's probably a good thing though it may limit the walk in custom a bit. Anyway, the place is nicely renovated, the staff attentive and the beer I had was excellent....

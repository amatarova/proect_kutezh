"Standard five-star hotel buffet, and some have, including a variety of Western, Japanese cuisine, dessert soft drinks are also available. But it really does not have any particularly striking highlights, quite satisfactory. The service is impressive, the staff is very polite, the service is very detailed, with particular attention to detail, consistent with the hotel's star.","5 из 5 кружков","70085EA408555CB0F4266128E322F6D4","Отзыв написан 15 декабря 2016"

"A great way to start the day if you are staying at or near the J W Marriott in Beijing. Fine omelet station. Better yet -- a noodle station where you can select your components (chicken, vegetables), your noodles (wheat, rice), and your spices afterwards. Wide choice of fresh juices. Coffee is fine -- although the service can be a...

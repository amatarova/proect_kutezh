"My first trip to Beijing and a friend of mine recommended me this place, he wasn't wrong. Food is not expensive, it's delicious and the staff are amazingly friendly. Gao yang, one of our waiters did more than he was supposed to do. We came for a second time and he asked the chef to make an special dessert plate...

"Haidilao has many outlets all over BJ (and other cities). It is simple and very very good hotpot with amazing service. The food is good - choose some meats and veg and i love the shrimp that is all ground up, they bring it out in a container like a pastry chef uses for decorating a cake... the server will...

"It was my first time eating hot pot and i really enjoyed it. You can also get vegetables and fruits at the salad bar. ~70 yuan per person. But it's good to come with many people and you have to book in advance. Even though it was a very nice decorated restaurant, i was a bit shocked about the toilet...

"This a nice place for hot pot. Nice broth, variety of meat, fish, vegetables. Good selection of sauces, condiments. An extremely helpful staff. No English menu, they speak English so so, but somehow it is not too difficult to order. Ambience is also nice, a very busy place. They bring nice smaller chopsticks for children. We payed 315 RMB for...

"If you like Sichuan hotpot, then don't miss Haidilao. They are selling haidilao hotpot mix worldwide now...so we took it home. All Haidilao are good, but the one South of Sanlitun is special because more lively, close to the nightlife district. Avoid the crowd and go there in the middle of the afternoon or late evening after 9.30pm. It is...

"Our group of 7 had a tremendous hotpot experience. The food was great as was the service. The whole meal with drinks (many) and countless plates of meat was only 800 rmb and was great value for the money considering this was a famous hot pot restaurant.

"Was at dinner with some friends at this outlet. The service is impeccable and it's almost impossible to find a similar restaurant who can rival Haidilao. Waiting was pleasantly distracted by manicurists, service staff who offered games, cards & snacks. They were also constantly reassuring and giving us updates on the waiting time. Once seated, the service staff came by...

"It is common knowledge that Haidilao is the best practice in China in regards to the quality of service. I was however disappointed when I went there for dinner and observed an unacceptable food safety related incident (which wouldn't normally surprise me in China, but it does surprise me at Haidilao!). When a chopstick fell on the floor, the waitress...

If anything my experience was better because we didn't have to wait for 45minute to get a seat, the service was more attentive because they had more time to dedicate to us.

"We live in BJ and Pie Square is our weekly pizza stop. The deep dish pizza is excellent. We particularly like the BLT pizza and meatball subs. Great place for lunch or dinner.","5 из 5 кружков","62D7A351C04E39C82F889ED043B82DDC","18 февраля 2017"

"Pie Squared Pizza was my first foray into deep-dish Chicago-style pizza and will, unfortunately, be my last. I ordered takeout, though, so that might have affected the quality of my food. The pizza I ordered was the BBQ chicken pizza and my friend had hyped up this style of pizza, claiming there was more substance to it since the ratio...

"We had the good fortune to eat at Pie Squared. The pizza was great, and not just for Beijing. I would go here is they had one at home. It is a bit hard to find, go behind the super market and keep walking to the back of the strip of stores. It is well worth the effort. They even...

"Six of us had a wonderful dinner here one evening. Wonderful salad, stromboli, deep dish (square!) pizza, spaghetti, and beers. We traveled over 12 miles to get here (by metro) and it was worth every minute of travel time. Asher is a great host and his staff was friendly and attentive. Quiet enough to be able to sit and visit...

"We found this place through Trip Advisor while attending a conference at the local convention center located near the Beijing Airport. The Owner was working behind the counter and was very helpful explaining the menu choices and answering our questions.

"After 7 years, all my other pizza experiences were, ""Well it's pretty good, for Beijing"" until I had my first bite of pie at Pie Squared. Their pies are awesome! And not just in relation to Beijing. This is the real deal!!! Their stiff buttery crust would be delectable just on its own but they add the right toppings in...

"Pizza is authentic Detroit style made by Michigan native. Worth the extra drive out of the city. In addition, the grilled thin crust is unique and very tasty.

"I have visited and ordered takeaway Pizza's from Pie-Squared for the past year. I believe they make Pizza's 'the right way'. Hand made bases (you are not restricted to a generic size or style of base), they use fresh, good quality ingredients and without over-complicating in a non-pretentious way, they produce a great pizza which is all about the taste....

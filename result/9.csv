"After having tried numerous restaurants in Beijing, I have turned to this highly rated restaurant in a Porsche location. We ordered many dishes which are innovative and were well satisfied that they also tasted as good as they looked. The dishes were a bit small, more of a tasting dish but the prices were still reasonable considering the location and decor. It was a good experience overall and worth recommendation for a different food experience.","4 из 5 кружков","10BB15BDB3D7384F388A72F58887A558","5 марта 2017"
"The restaurant is located at the ex embassy of the United States, a curious building in victorian style in the middle of the chinese capital, in a few steps of the Tiannamen square. The food taste so amazing, the soundtrack is just perfect and the decoration a must see!","5 из 5 кружков","708C1CF91959D84E1B4ED2D57E3A7EE5","3 марта 2017"
"Love this place. Location in the former quadrangle of a European embassy district: magnificent. Ambience from the chairs, to the cool plate covers, and the decor: uniquely attractive. The food and service are as good as you will find anywhere in Beijing. The cocktails are outrageously good.","5 из 5 кружков","F6404A17EEFE5E38A328215FBB24CE07","Отзыв написан 25 января 2017"
"Made a reservation for 8.30pm on Sunday night but could have got a table as not full. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a good choice of food and drink which was excellent. They speak English reasonably well so communication was easy and service was quick and efficient. Would recommend this place and would return on our next visit.","5 из 5 кружков","173CC71C0CFEF5CBFBC53C0670B44A4C","Отзыв написан 24 января 2017"
"This restaurant is located where the old US embassy (built in the early 1900s) used to be. Make sure you check out the architecture around. Food itself is great, but on the pricier side. It's great for a romantic evening out. Since Yunnan food is so different from ""mainstream"" Chinese food, you can always find something new to explore in this restaurant.","4 из 5 кружков","AF45F27D0AD4DA4032EC3AAF7A61804A","Отзыв написан 20 января 2017"
"Food really disappointed us the most. We were looking for fresh and flavourful Yunan cuisine and we were served catering not warm food. Food was not made to order. Pork was dry and tasteless. Eggplant wasn't seasoned at all. Chicken was good but served too cold. The atmosphere is kind of good but if you go for the food you'll get disappointed. Wine was really good although overpriced. I've had better food in other places around Beijing. If you're looking for good food this is definitely not the right place.","2 из 5 кружков","ACA26364EBDDDF10C3C5212DEAEB2FAC","Отзыв написан 14 января 2017"
"Went for dinner there and it was the best dining experience I had in Beijing. The restaurant had a lovely ambience, very well decorated with exquisite ornaments and paintings. Upon arrival, I was ushered to the 2nd storey. The place was dimly lit but bright enough to see the menu. It was my first time trying Yunan cuisine and truth be told I had my reservations. My husband and I ordered 4 dishes and we weren't the least bit disappointed. In fact we loved every single bit of it! The price is very reasonable too. We thought it would cost a lot more given the posh interior.

I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again if I were to go to China. This place has got me fallen head over heels with Yunan cuisine!","5 из 5 кружков","D694E766306AC14541C07E7E8A212C72","Отзыв написан 6 января 2017"
"Having visited the sister restaurant in the chain in Shanghai, the menu was excellent, as expected, full of interesting Yunnan and Burma vegetable dishes and plenty of fish and mean dishes too. Above average wine list. The restaurant is to be found in a strangely quiet enclave near the centre, in a compound that was built for foreign embassies in the late Imperial era (Qing). Definitely worth a visit.","5 из 5 кружков","F83548ADBAC27462D86DE9A7CE2C4C5C","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2016"

"taste experience from the south west province of China known as Yunan, bordering Vietnam and Burma. As a result the flavours were a mix of the area and were truly a delightful experience.

"the food was very good, the highlight of which was probably the lamb samosas which came with a kind of tomatillo sauce (delicious).

Only hiccup is that we had to return an entree that the waiter assured was not spicy because, well, it was really spicy for us.

Beautiful, relaxed atmosphere.

"Spent 4 hours at the restaurant and bar. Very good food and service (they told us when we had ordered too much!) and good wine selection for Beijing. Prices were ""Western"" but we expected this. The bar was quiet but not their fault as was a Wednesday night. Restaurant was busy. Terrific bar and a great scotch on the huge rock (barman hand crafted an ice cube ball the size of a tennis ball - great touch). As we were last ones in the bar we were even given permission to light up cigars! Highly recommended and Tiananmen Square just around the corner!","5 из 5 кружков","E30FFC5698C0CA8A82BDA022CA8164F2","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"
"My wife, a friend that we met in Beijing and I enjoyed our evening at Lost Heaven. The decor is exotic but very comfortable. The service was excellent and unobtrusive. The food was of a very high quality. It is heavily spiced, so be prepared for that.
The location of the restaurant is a bit difficult to find. It is located within an inner courtyard. So take a taxi, that will make finding it much easier.","5 из 5 кружков","77653517124DD8B522073901B31673D6","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2016"

"Well appointed restaurant with attentive staff many of whom speak English.
The menu is varied and offers dishes in most categories. Food was well-prepared, arrived on-time and was hot. The soy chicken was especially delicious. Prices are mid-range making this restaurant an excellent choice.
However, it is in a hidden away location and it is difficult to find transportation after dinner.","5 из 5 кружков","836BA20FDBB4D6FB8D07E301206B64FC","Отзыв написан 5 ноября 2016"

"This place was recommended by people we met at the Black Sesame Kitchen. It was a good recommendation. The food is very good. The restaurant is located in the old compound of the American Embassy, very close to Tiannamen Square. It is darkly lit and the diners are largely tourists and visitors. However, the food is of a very high standard and the service is good. It was not as a good as the Black Sesame Kitchen and the atmosphere is perhaps a little austere, but is a good venue for a nice dinner, or a business dinner. The food is varied and tasty. It is regional food from Yunnan province, and is well prepared and presented and the portions are reasonably generous. I would recommend ordering a selection and sharing. We had 4 mains, plus 2 vegetable sides dishes for six of us and it was more than adequate. Good place for dinner at night, but also the kind of place you could have a business dinner or lunch.","4 из 5 кружков","374417BB0ABE8EAB2BA9D594D891998F","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"

"We enjoyed a special luncheon for our tour group, just prior to the Forbidden City visit. We had a group of about 32 couples. We were served family style.... most local favorites of Chinese food. The service was great, the food was tasty and plentiful.

Never saw the bill, but I assume it was expensive....the quality would justify the price I my opinion. We would certainly go back again.","5 из 5 кружков","C91877B1A81DDB4F00C0351E05524087","Отзыв написан 16 октября 2016"
"Went to this restaurant on our last night based on the excellent reviews here on TA.

So firstly, the restaurant as mentioned in other reviews is in a compound near Mao's mausoleum, it is relatively straight forward to find and has signage out the front before you enter through the main gate. Overall though the restaurant is quite expensive for China though our mains varied from 128 yuan to 148yuan each.

We had 1x entree which was the vegetarian bread with a tomato salsa. Overall pretty good, but nothing exceptional.

We shared 3x mains which were: the spicy and sour prawns, spicy beef stir fry and the chicken with green onion and chilli.

The prawns and chicken were nice, and I have to say we enjoyed them. The beef however was a massive miss. The beef itself was of poor quality and had more chunks of fat then actual beef. Maybe a case of ordering the wrong kind of meat? Certainly would not recommend anyone order a beef dish if eating here.

We went on a Saturday night at 17:30 (right when the restaurant opened). There was plenty of space at the time but we were told we needed to leave by 19:30. Which was not an issue.

The staff were also friendly and the food came quickly. Overall a decent choice, based on the prawns and chicken we had.","3 из 5 кружков","9F2F30C10FDC598459ADB268E480F3D2","Отзыв написан 15 октября 2016"

"A little difficult to find, number 23 which is the old US embassy complex. Without the high recommendations on trip advisor we probably wouldn't have gone in, it looks upmarket and is very nice and actually mid-priced. The drinks were especially expensive. The food had vegetarian options and the staff were well versed re what vegetarians could and could not eat. The vegetarian food we had was extremely nice and we would have no hesitation in recommending.","5 из 5 кружков","67501FF0000341CA37ECE765E6F4F00D","Отзыв написан 6 октября 2016"
"Booked at 7.45pm via our hotel and luckily got a table for 8.30pm. On arrival, the restaurant looked very civilised and was well appointed. Food was amazing. My wife and I shared an eggplant/aubergine and tofu salad (slightly spicy but delicious and tofu was creamy) and the prawn spring rolls (which were tasty and had a great texture). For main we shared the sliced pork (very delicious) with a broccoli side (served slightly al dente) and some steamed rice each. To drink we had a berry cocktail and a passion fruit and ginger cocktail. The dessert menu was a bit uninspiring - ice cream or fruit so we saved some calories. Service was friendly and attentive and they offered to call us a taxi after we'd paid the bill. Note 10% off with Visa Platinum cards. Given the reasonable cost (just under 400RMB) for the quality of the food married to the great service from the staff, a solid five star rating is well deserved. I highly recommend.","5 из 5 кружков","8E3F80EB0A9C947E07B50D2011C392D4","Отзыв написан 5 октября 2016"
"The food is good, but it's not the best Yunnanese that I've had in Beijing. Surprising light on mushroom and greens, which I find are often the best dishes in Yunnan. Anyway, the venue more than makes up for it, located in the former foreign legation district near Tian'anmen square. If you're in the area, it's worth checking out.","4 из 5 кружков","B7C3A4D4352FC6DC0543E14DB93E42FF","Отзыв написан 2 октября 2016"

"From the start till the end: fantastic food, service, and drinks!
Loved the ability of trying out different Asia cuisines in same place.
Special mention to and reco for the following:
Chicken salad, Crab in tomato & coconut sauce, the cocktails (there was this one with watermelon, gin, chili, lemon & coriander!)","5 из 5 кружков","851BF098B4C112C31FF7294D4EFD0FEE","Отзыв написан 11 сентября 2016"
"This was by far, and most certainly one of the top 3 x meals I have had. Ever. (I do love food.. So I don;t say this lightly ;) )
This is definitely among the spicier variety as far as Eastern cuisine goes, but the delicate blend of fresh chilli, garlic, ginger and coriander and blends together beautifully to create a taste explosion in your mouth. (PS - They do love their garlic.. so best make sure your significant other dines with you!)
The food was exceptionally tasty, to the point that between the three of us we scooped up every last crumb and made sure that nothing went to waste. The menu is not the cheapest, but its not over the top expensive either. At the end of it, you don;t just come here for a meal, you come to a restaurant like this for an experience. The drink prices are quite heavy, though. The beer we ordered came in a tiny dinky bottle for about 40RMB. Expensive if you compare it to some of the other places - but you don't really come here to get drunk either!
It can be a little difficult to find. If one member of our group didn;t have an impeccable sense of direction, and a map, we would never have found it. The cab could also only drop us off within a few blocks of Tiananmen square (the square and restaurant are a stones throw from each other - well worth visiting both in one go and make it an outing). My suggestion would be to get a clear map, and get as close as possible via the subway. The roads surrounding the square are all barricaded at night, which makes the area a little difficult to navigate.
By far one of my favourite meals. When next I find myself in China, this will definitely be included on my to-do list!","5 из 5 кружков","2A7A2457F375E484FD444F95E114C747","Отзыв написан 9 сентября 2016"

"A simple ordering of 1st and 2nd course and a small bottle of beer. After a bit too long waiting arrived the 2nd course... hey, where the 1st course? Oh, the waiter just forgot. After another 5 minutes the salad came. However, I had to negotiate with the manager to get the already cold 2nd course replaced. That was finally done. People nicely dressed, nice reddish design. 160 Yuan for the bill that is not too much.

"We visited this restaurant by the book (Lonely Planet). The restaurant has a lot of atmosphere (darkness and candles) and an East Berlin feel to it - like so much in Beijing, a new and surprising mixture of communism and capitalism and classics old and modern. The most amazing experience in this restaurant is provided by the toilet. You see nothing of yourself in the frame where you expect a mirror because you see through to the men's. It feels as if you have vanished. My tofu dish was very jelly-pudding-like. When the waiter explained that the tofu was fixed with beef jelly, I nearly choked on my food. The vegetable dish was overcooked which happens very rarely in a Chinese kitchen. The cucumber soup was mainly hot and thin with little cucumber visible or tasteable. The other guests just wanted to escape afterwards and did not even feel like a stroll in the splendidly lit Tiananmen Square nearby. For a more happy experience, go in for just for a drink, the bar is very long and well stocked.","2 из 5 кружков","117CE759D8A24757A86C262FFF2F75E6","Отзыв написан 7 августа 2016"

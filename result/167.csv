"This restaurant specializes in Sardinian Italian food and wines. It is priced on the moderate side but is well worth the price. The owner, Masimo, goes out of his way to make his customers happy.","5 из 5 кружков","0DA49B8257441FD6F6A47247B0E34634","25 февраля 2017"

"Another great meal here at Central Park LM Plus. Massimo was on hand and cooking and serving as he does most nights. This place is the real deal. Sardinian and general Italian classics as they should be. The restaurant is very nice and comfortable. It hits that sweet spot of being romantic enough for a great couples dinner, but casual...

"Although located in the somewhat bland Central Park ExPat ghetto, LMPLUS is absolutely delightful. Extremely friendly Southern Italian family-owners. Warm dining environment. Excellent wines. Wonderful pizzas, fish and grilled meats. Importantly, there is a beautiful private dining space which, as you might expect is often in great demand. There is also a pretty outdoor space to enjoy the Beijing breezes....

"I went twice to this nice Italian restaurant. I do like Chinese food, but when in China I do not like to it it all by myself as I feel Chinese food has to be shared. This Italian restaurant proved to be the worthy alternative, although on the first night I was disappointed by the Saffran risotto. It did not...

"There are two LMPlus restaurants in Central Park. Both owned and operated by the same people. One is a pizzeria, with great pizza. The other is fine dining. This review is about the fine dining spot around the corner. Not a flashy place, but this restaurant has good Italian food and great wine selections. You can also get pizza here...

"This little restaurant is in the apartment complex where our daughter lives so it was a logical choice for dinner one evening when we fancied a change from Chinese food. The menu offers a good choice of dishes, reasonably priced and our meals were good. Service was efficient: Massimo runs his restaurant well. The wine prices can be steep -...

"We live in the same Central Park complex, so this our our local pizza place. Nice people, speak decent English. Pizza is very good, we usually split a bottle of wine or get a beer. The wine list is expensive - similiar to the sister resturant around the corner (a more upscale place). Stick with the LM house wine -...

"The pizza is very good, with quality ingredients and it is really authentic (I'm Italian). The place (in Central Park) is tiny, with just a handful of tables, but has nice decor and atmosphere. It is not cheap, and the Tsingtao is a bit of a rip off though.","4 из 5 кружков","C78432EF71108D39F169F41DD98EB6A1","Отзыв написан 6 января 2013"
"Massimo and Sue really takes care of you here. The Italian staples are on the menu but they do it well. Great wine selection, super ambience and attentative service. If you are staying in the Guomao area (Kerry Centre/China World/CCTV Tower) then within walking distance and well worth a visit.","4 из 5 кружков","D56CC6C333666E4FEEAEA7F573949941","Отзыв написан 27 декабря 2012"
"This place is knows for it's pizza's, and they are pretty good; It's located in Beijing's Central Park, quiet, nice, clean, modern, centrally located (and no traffic!), surrounded by Beijing's skyscrapers; when the days are warmer they also have outdoor seating. the place itself is quite small, which is not a bad thing per-se, makes the place more intimate. not...

"This is one of the signature Cantonese restaurants belonging to the famous The Peninsula hotel in Beijing. It is located in the basement and after renovation, it is ready to bring an exquisite dining experience.

"So came here and there was a buffet lunch. I spilt my orange juice on my pants - no napkins to wipe myself. No tissue, cloth for the table or napkins to wipe up the juice. Amazing! That is a bit crazy I think Otherwise the food is okay. There was buffet with a lot of Peking duck. Most things...

"Our party of three had dinner at Huang Ting. It was a Saturday night and the place was nearly empty. There were 3 other tables in addition to ours. Perhaps this may be attributed to the fact that the restaurant is located 2 levels below street level in the shopping arcade...it made for a somewhat odd ambiance, although the interior...

"We ate here on our first night in Beijing because we couldn't be bothered with finding a decent local restaurant. It is located in the Peninsula hotel, two floors below the lobby. We had Peking duck and it was delicious. The chef carves it in front of you. As is the case with all restaurants in China, wines are way...

"The restaurant is located in the shopping arcade of The Peninsula Hotel. It is very spacious with the interior being classic Chinese. They have a dress code of smart casual, and specially the wines are rather expensive so it is not a drop in spot for a snack and a beer. The food was excellent and so were the wines...

"Had the lunch tim sum. Not typical Cantonese fare but close, although I Was told the chefs were from Hkg. An average eatry in Hkg would serve much better quality of the same fare. The decor was nice though. Service was like any four star hotel. Would try again just to see if it is any better.","3 из 5 кружков","C9E32B5274D74FD465F898DF22D32C6D","Отзыв написан 20 марта 2015"
"Good dim sum, in a very pretty dining room (considering you're in a basement). This is perhaps not quite as good as the best dim sum in HK, but for Beijing it is right up there with Seventh Son as the best in town.","3 из 5 кружков","08B2187507132C37E72DE76B782D14CE","Отзыв написан 9 февраля 2015"

"This restaurant was in our hotel and we had a really good meal here. They gave us a side room where we could look out at the other diners, although there weren't very many ! The food is plentiful and very good quality. Order the duck for the adventure of having it carved and wrapped into pancakes at your table....

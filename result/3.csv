"This is a good quality hotel, clean and with good staff. The price is reasonable except during the peak holiday times. Please note that it claims to have a bar but does not, however, there ia a small backpackers style bar directly opposite the front door. Very close to Tianenmen Square and to two Metro stations.","5 из 5 кружков","0F9AD029BDC8D022EFAFBF781C674727","14 марта 2017"

"I had a very different experience from previous posters, both good and bad perspectives on the same issues. First, the quantity and value of food. Anyone who has had a tasting menu of this quality would never say this is not great value. It is high quality food at a very reasonable price relative to other menus around the world (sure, Beijing skews lower in prices overall but my comparison is more global). As for quantity, anyone with experience with tasting menus would never say this place is not enough food. Over the entire meal more than enough. The second perspective concerns service. Here my experience is a negative take on previous reviews. People have said the service is ""quick."" This is true. Too true. With a tasting menu, one shouldn't have three dishes on table at one time, which is what we experienced. Slow down the service. At a minimum, let the diner finish the course they are eating before bringing a new one. Maybe even give them2 minutes between courses. I appreciate that each course isn't 15 minutes apart like places, but seriously we had 3 different courses on the table at one time. Slow down. Also, they ask you do some strange things at the end of the meal like have your picture taken and write a note (to whom, I can't say). Just strange.","3 из 5 кружков","B5554D2AAA4D355118C655ED14B8EBFA","24 февраля 2017"
"The best dishes were bamboo dumplings, avocado spring rolls, eggplant & tofu, and an Indonesian curry. But all of the portions were way too small. For 3 of us, with tea and a few other dishes I didn't mention, the cost was CNY 1,368. About $200 USD. And I left still hungry. Big disappointment! But the atmosphere was AMAZING! Very nice classy place.","2 из 5 кружков","F5DB5B01712ECF1E7A1A223BFE206581",""
"We came to King's Joy Beijing for luncheon after going to the Lama temple nearby. We did not have a booking but were offered to wait in case a table became available. We were served tea and a short while later, a table having become available - luckily!, I advise booking in advance - we went for luncheon proper. The venue is a place of beauty, peaceful and stylish - have a look at the pictures. Two ladies were playing the harp and the cello, which added to an already very pleasant atmosphere. This is a wholly vegetarian place, we tried a few dishes and all were delicious. A bit expensive but well worth it, go have a try ! We warmly recommend it!","5 из 5 кружков","B4E17FCD960833F916CA9D5775535ABA","Отзыв написан 31 января 2017"

"This was a truly amazing vegetarian (vegan) experience. Since we were 6 they advised us to go for set menus. Our table chose 2 different set menus.
As with every set menu a few dishes were not exactly what you would have chosen.
However in general everything was of amazing quality and finesse. The dishes were presented beautifully. The flavours and consistencies were astonishing.
I will definitely go back on my next trip in Beijing
Only negative comment: they have an extensive wine list (a bit boring if you are often in China => always the same...), however their staff have no clue. You have to ask to taste the wine. When you order a second bottle of the same wine, they will not let one person taste it and just start pouring. Lots of improvement needed on that front! And a more fun wine list.","5 из 5 кружков","9718B3CD925335AA3E03E5DE187B38F7","Отзыв написан 12 января 2017"

"I don’t get it. Number one in Beijing. You are having a laugh. For sure the venue is amazing. But things go downhill once you actually sit down. If you go I suggest you go inside, swoon around a bit at the interiors, take in the misty atmosphere and the scents wafting over from the lama temple, and then leave with your wallet intact. It is the only way you will come out on top. We came as a couple and were seated initially at either end of an enormous table. It was impossible for us to speak to each other. In the end we had to move round to one side to get close enough for a conversation. We ordered the food and the waiter gave us a sort of smug grin. There was zero friendliness or welcoming attitude that is characteristic of TRB – which I guess is their main rival for the top spot. The wine was priced like we were in central London or New York. I got a small beer for four to five times the price that I could get it elsewhere on the same street. The food arrived and the portions were universally miniscule. Vegetarian food is not expensive to make, even if you give people massive portions. The prices here just bear no relation to what you get. At the end of the meal we left 800 yuan worse off (which is just ridiculous for vegetarian food in Beijing) and were so hungry that we actually did something I have never ever done before, and that is to go immediately to another restaurant (in this case ‘The veggie table’ 200m up the hutong) to have another meal. To avoid disappointment rob a bank and eat before you go.","1 из 5 кружков","A66C8980CD2177D8CEFE60A7EE4B53E8","Отзыв написан 2 января 2017"

"The menu is all vegetarian but there are so many options that you don't even feel it's lacking. The food was tasty but a little spicy. We got the dishes that were supposed to be not spicy at all, for the little kids, and they were still spicy. The restaurant is very large and nicely done. We had some live harp music while having dinner. They had special plastic dishes and cutlery for the kids which was a really nice surprise. The prices were a little high but we enjoyed the experience.","4 из 5 кружков","3A72CC696677D2ED8CB101A870EA4AAE","Отзыв написан 14 декабря 2016"

"I must say, half of the price that i have paid is for the setting. The restaurant design is AMAZING. First you enter through a chinese building doorway , and then there is this platform a mist as you walk along to get to the restaurant

Inside it is truly beautiful. Modern but yet traditional Chinese. The tables are very nicely well spaced out. The set menu ranges from $499-$1299 RMB. I went for the $699 set and it was already very good. A lot of mushrooms used, and well presented and taste is very good. I felt full after eating, but yet felt healthy!

Tea is not included, but I do recommend to order a pot to share as they do have a really good chinese tea selection, although some may think it is too extravagant to pay such a price for just tea.","4 из 5 кружков","FEC05CFF3AD7853A0405B8C5E3AED5E5","Отзыв написан 27 октября 2016"

"My friend recommneded this vegetarian restruant and decided to give it a try.
The decor and food quality/ presentation exceeded my expectation. It turns out to be one of the best vegi restauraunts i have ever been to.
There are a few set menus to choose from but all not 'cheap', the set menu starts from RMB 300 to 900 per person and extra pot of tea costs about RMB 300. I would suppose an average meal would cost about RMB 800 per person.
The restaurant is accomodated within a rennovated courtyard complex, very modern decor. It's definitely worth to visit just to experience the setting and the food.
Highly recommended.","5 из 5 кружков","1D9206B1FD8C77687D00D78DEED6D906","Отзыв написан 17 октября 2016"
"From the minute you enter the building you know you are in for something special. Entirely vegetarian the food is extraordinary. We have been vegetarians for over 30 years and this was the best food we have eaten. We went for one of the tasting menus and can recommend. Each course was an adventure with both presentation and flavour. Each dish was explained when it arrived but although the service was very attentive it was perhaps too much so at times. A place to go for a special occasion. They have their own parking too, a great bonus in that area.","5 из 5 кружков","B6A223820D2A81A1B0C2088B7D48373D","Отзыв написан 10 октября 2016"
"King's Joy is a pleasure in every way: it is located across the street from the Lama Temple, borders a hutong, and with pleasing architectural decor quietly accentuating its cuisine.
The vegetarian/vegan menu is itself a study in the expanse of plant base food sourcing and preparation techniques, and I sincerely meant that in the best, and not in an unappetizing, way. The food, pleasingly presented, is amazingly diverse in both taste and consistency, from a subtle broth to an intensely textured mushroom steak. This is a meal of both immense enjoyment and highly educational vegetarian dining. One does not have to BE vegetarian to appreciate the cuisine here.","5 из 5 кружков","7D6970E9EB753B4598946E155D00D33B","Отзыв написан 6 октября 2016"

"Bottom line: come here knowing you'll splurge, then sit back to enjoy a fine dining experience.

This vegetarian restaurant is a fantastic fine dining experience, though no need to dress up or fuss to enjoy. From the moment you come into the space, you know something special awaits. The twists and turns in the building's design lead to a surprising and serene courtyard. The chef mirrors that experience with the menu--go for one of the set options--which provides only the most basic description of ingredients, while the spices are a delight to discover.

My experience at the restaurant was during lunch time at weekday, which was quite busy. The restaurant was bright and warm with sunlight coming in through the floor to ceiling windows of thew courtyard, and streaming in overhead from the skylight above. I'd expect that in the evening it would be amazing to eat hidden away in one of their semi private rooms or the courtyard.

Our set menu was fantastic, though at 588RMB per person one would expect no less. Of the 10 dishes, the best was the braised eggplant, although the turnip cake and the water spinach were close to beat it out. The textures were very well balanced throughout, and executed so well that it was hard to believe we were eating healthy (or vegetarian, for that matter).

They offer two beverage menus, both of which are quite extensive (and a glimpse into their wine cave backs it up). We opted to stick with the house made non-alcoholic beverages, and tried the lavender soymilk (warm and tasty) as well as the rose iced tea (refreshingly sweet). Beverages will set you back about 70 rmb per glass, so be aware.

Throughout the meal, they had a harp and cello player offering live music, which was a nice touch. Service was extremely attentive--from the moment you come in, throughout the meal, and even wandering about the grounds of the restaurant.

We noted that the restaurant offers a high tea/dim sum in the afternoon, complete with push-carts to let you choose options on sight. Would be nice to go back for that.

Overall, a special place for a special occasion. I would definitely go back (after saving up again).","5 из 5 кружков","2C34ECEE470813EF0C0AE032D8FA31D1","Отзыв написан 2 августа 2016"
"The restaurant was recommended as very special and since we were looking for a vegetarian menu we walked there from our BaoChao Hutong on the second night in Beijing. The entrance to the restaurant is somewhat hidden from the main street, and the courtyard, lit with ground level lights and mystical bursts of mist made it mysterious. A large room with tables distributed on two or three levels, we were seated facing a duo of young women, dressed in white, one playing the cello and the other a harp. It was beautiful.
A chandelier with five white candles was placed on our table and after we exploring the menu of unfamiliar offerings, the candles on the tables were lit the electric lights th turned off . Appetizers, hot entrees, including a soup with beans, berries and greens floating, a few dishes with ingredients we were familiar with, different mushrooms and tofu -- all were delicious, including the deserts. Food is served designer style and in beautiful ceramic plates and bowls. We drank green tea. It was such a treat!","5 из 5 кружков","4D9CEAD2ADD73AE3AB9D37183717389A","Отзыв написан 5 июля 2016"
"We ate here because we wanted to try Chinese fine dining. The prices are really over the top so we expected to be blown away by the dishes. We asked our waiter for advice of what to order and I followed it by ordering a bean curd starter and King pao mushroom dish for second, however when my partner fried to order something from the menu not recommended by the waiter he simply said ""No, I don't recommend that"" - we were not sure why the dish was not recommended, but my partner ended up choosing another mushroom dish.

We paid about 650 Cny for one starter, two
mains, one beer and one glass of wine. The bean curd starter was amazing, but our other dishes were blend... Maybe we paid those high prices for having a harp and guitar show in the middle of the room or the candelabra that they lit and turned of all the lights in the restaurant. If you want a really nice experience and are not on a budget, then sure go here! But if you expect to get food worth its price, don't.","3 из 5 кружков","899C92D7AE8698BA40DC51F95A86225F","Отзыв написан 1 июля 2016"

"Coming here with family was one of the best decisions I have ever made. This restaurant is spectacular from inside out, top to bottom, left to right. The ambience & environment it gives off is in-describable. As Beijing is a high maintenance fast running city, this restaurant really slows things down & allows you to enjoy your meal, your surroundings, & cherish time. The food was delectable & the dessert was delicious. Accompanied with the wine served by the manager (I'm guessing), this meal was A+. As well as the service from the bar (fruits, biscuits, enzyme juice), and the service from the waiters, everything was perfect. Highly recommended, this restaurant definitely lives up to the price of it's dishes. (Ingredients are all organic, & very much fresh.) I cannot stress how much I loved this restaurant.

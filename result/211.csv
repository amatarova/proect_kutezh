"Maybe for a Chinese who has never had Italian food (you know the people I am talking about, the one's who will put ketchup on pasta and think it's Spaghetti Bolognese) this place is ok. But anyone else may have trouble with it.","2 из 5 кружков","381FDCBBB8B27A61F4A03F62A3FC2778","Отзыв написан 1 июня 2016"

"Great place to enjoy a quiet meal. Excellent manager who gives friendly personalized service. Great pizza and home made pasta. Always topped off nicely with a very generous serving of the desert of your choice. Food menu could be a bit more varied.","5 из 5 кружков","97E1D5D060A51AD7C07E2420D8A6B955","Отзыв написан 15 сентября 2015"
"Since first coming here last year, the size of the menu has increased, the food quality has plummeted, and they no longer serve authentic Italian. The restaurant was once a really excellent restaurant, but due to what was likely an ownership change the restaurant is now no better than the average Italian restaurant you're likely to eat at in China.","3 из 5 кружков","1CBFDC2C2BFFCD6FA08C288314232AE8","Отзыв написан 24 июля 2015"

"I have been here several times with the kids. The pizza is very nice and reasonably priced. It is an authentic Italian style pizza which is light on the toppings and a nice sauce base. Just the way I like it. Have also tried a few of the salads which were also very good. My daughter tried a curry which...

"Twice bitten, once shy. That's my approach and feeling to this restaurant. Gave it two chances but disappointed both times. Quite expensive, and service was waning both occasions. Just did not live up to my anticipated expectations. Quite flavourless - which surprises me for an Italian restaurant - easily add flavour to Italian food. I'm not giving it a third...

"Decent place and reasonable services. Good pizza and pasta in general. Good effort to prepare desserts and ice creams. By far the best restaurant for western food in the area, when considering both food and the place.","4 из 5 кружков","923AD0F097A02C61E112DF107175BD31","Отзыв написан 17 марта 2015"
"Following the tripadvisor recmmendations we stopped here. Honestly without that we probably would never have tried this small italian restaurant. Or even found :-) It is really authentic, with an open kitchen and tasty food. The service is very friendly and attentive. Good place also for kids. But #3 in Beijing...? I doubt a little bit","4 из 5 кружков","EFC1828AE167D64A465A74997E09AFD7","Отзыв написан 13 февраля 2015"
"Went there with my best friend and former schoolmate, Sabrina. Very nice pizzas, could be the best in Shun Yi. The seafood spaghetti was just perfectly done. Love their yogurt gelato and tiramisu. Will come and gather with other buddies from ISB when I am next in Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","97BEAA0EB5B971DFBF0D260E03092537","Отзыв написан 5 февраля 2015"
"It was hard to get a table for 7, but the staff could manage very fast! As I travel to Italy a lot, I know how Italian food taste and here in Beijing almost 8000 km away all the food we had was like sitting near the Canale Grande in Venice!!! The service was on a high level! The price...

"For me, it is pretty simple, I love it! First, opening the door, the staff warmly welcome you, smiling and taking care of you : they are adorable, I feel like in family place. Then, the cuisine... italian. And they have a chef, a real, genuine, italian one, who has long experience in restaurant business in Beijing. The guy is...

"Read from That's Magazine that this restaurant was the newly crowed Restaurant of the Year and visiting it with family for a belated Christmas dinner on 26th. They had their Christmas menu on the previous days but my kids were promised for a great Christmas meal. By request they offered the same menu to us and the kids were greatly...

"This is not what you expect to find tucked in a corner of a plaza in Shunyi and is a pleasant surprise. It's in a quaint semi-detached building and serves authentic Italian food. We shared a large cold cut platter to start, nice portions and everything was obviously imported. Parma ham pizza as mains, excellent, my wife's Pacherri pasta was...

"Visited this place when I was in Beijing, and it blew my mind! At first I was a bit skeptical at trying any type of Western food while I was in China, but I am glad that I gave this place a chance. It's only about 10-15 mins away from the airport, so this is perfect place for a last...

"I live in Tianzhu, Shunyi and have visited eatalicious several times. It's a wonderful neighborhood spot, but highest rated restaurant in Beijing? I love their cozy atmosphere and the fact that they show old movies but if you are in Beijing proper I would hesitate to make the trek out to the airport area. Good food, but I think better...

"This little restaurant hiding in a corner of Shunyi is the best Italian restaurant we've been in Beijing. It is small but cozy. Besides the good Italian food and the attentive service,they have the best pizza in town. You have to order the pizza while dining here. Highly recommended!","5 из 5 кружков","F6089D6C75B567208D12A2A0F5EF28DB","Отзыв написан 4 ноября 2014"
"I was recommended to this little Italian restaurant by a friend from Siena. We loved it from the first sight of this little cozy house after a 10mins ride from the airport. We order several common family dishes from green salad, prosuitto, carbonara and steak.... It is just as if you would have them in Southern Italy. We finished the...

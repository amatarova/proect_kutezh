"We ordered the duck, a stir-fry cabbage and the vinegar fish soup. While the quality of the food was good, the host whom set the mood while walking you in leaves a lot more to be desired. As my hotel made the reservation, it took her (and another colleague) some nuclear-physics-like process to confirm the booking name, and thereafter a...

"For a place that's built it's reputation on roast duck, I found it to be the least interesting part of my meal at Dadong. The chicken liver terrine shaped like cherries, the sweet pork in the form of a river bank, the excellent grilled Wagyu and the Singapore noodles were all far tastier and more impressive than the supposed star...

"Very well made duck, by professional cooks. You need to make a reservation prior your visit, but if you reserve around mid-day and come at 7pm they should have plenty of free seats. The duck is served with extra-thin pancakes, crisps, and vegetables+sauce plate to add to the duck. You wrap the duck into a pancake and place some cucumber,...

"Crowded, noisy but overall well prepared Pekinese roasted duck. Decent price, although there are more affordable offers out there. The duck soup you ate served at the end is tasty, although you can avoid it if you are a bit doubtful about eating the duck's blood.","4 из 5 кружков","E9E2F8C94E1DA41C9C06E635AFF63FD1","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"
"Always have to stop here whenever I get to Beijing. Very nice restaurant, professional and friendly service, excellent wine/beer list and the duck. The DUCK!!! Salivating by just writing this. Last time, while waiting for the duck, we got some parma ham covered dates as a starter. Foodgasm in our mouths. I believe this one is the original restaurant. You...

We also tried a number of other dishes, and everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The menu is like a work of art, with all the dishes beautifully photographed.

"We were the only Caucasians dining in this large, very Chinese styled, restaurant. It specializes in varieties of duck as well as seasonal seafood in contemporary, beautiful presentations. The wait staff generally does not speak English but this is amply compensated for by the menus -- gorgeous, coffee-table sized, illustrated volumes depicting and describing the luscious choices the menu offers....

Good veggies, good appetizers, didn't care much for the soup, but the fried apple dumplings with carmelized sugar was amazing. Really good, worth a trip to eat here.","5 из 5 кружков","7F99BB611B11D2CE6B53D7D29E0576E6","Отзыв написан 28 июля 2016"

"I've had a few Peking ducks but this one was definitely the best. It is cooked so tender and when added with the condiments and pancakes it tastes beautiful!

"We ordered some lamb kebabs and a few other lamb dishes. The place is well known for it's hot pot - we preferred not to order that. The service was good and the food was delicious.

"Our hotel recommended we try this chain of hotpot restaurants. It was a good recommendation: we enjoyed the experience of cooking our own meat and vegetables in the boiling broth. Excellent sesame sauce and other accompaniments.","4 из 5 кружков","7F27B603434C31A940614924B8F8DF3A","Отзыв написан 6 мая 2015"

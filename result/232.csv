"This restaurant was recommended by a friend that lives in Beijing and we are very happy that we made time to go. The hostess at the restaurant spoke english and took great care of us, she recommended the best dishes to choose and advised us about the portion sizes. When the food came we were so impressed, it looked amazing...

"This restaurant on the 2nd floor of an office building was right across the highway from the Sofitel Hotel where we were guests. The food was good, if you are willing to take a little adventure where communication is limited to sign language. We were advised to always ask for bottled water and even that was a challenge at this...

"Food was good here, and quite authentic. The presentation of each dish was thoughtful. The price was reasonable considering the quality you got in return.

"The banana and sugar were to die for. Our chicken dish with veggies amazing. We ordered so many varieties and all of it was wonderful.

"I would recommend a visit to this restaurant if you find yourself in Beijing and are looking for some local Chinese food. We find all the dishes we sampled to be a cut above the standard Chinese fare in Bejing while not being classified as a gourmet style restaurant. The carp with a sauce of very light curry flavor was...

"The duck seemed fatty and the skin was not crispy. It just didn't live up to expectation. The extras were ok, but the wine was just right. We expected an explanation of what was served and a demonstration of the duck roles, but it was totally silent.","3 из 5 кружков","5CB8076AB651E14BC376604E84495D13","Отзыв написан 28 марта 2016"

"The food was good, menu quite extensive, but absolutely no-one spoke English so even the tiniest request or question took for ages as everyone asked someone else but nothing happened. So that and the lack of sincere interest was disappointing. As a Chinese you'll be fine, as a foreigner you'll need a lot of patience.","2 из 5 кружков","4900D82A8094799A8927897DE1599C36","Отзыв написан 8 августа 2015"

"We had the opportunity to visit this restaurant as an ""extra"" tour provided through Viking River cruises.

"I am an American living in Beijing. When my Chinese boss said we were taking out our Chinese client to a good Chinese restaurant, I was surprised to see that about 2/3 of the restaurant's patrons were European tourists.

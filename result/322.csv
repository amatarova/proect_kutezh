"Went with Chinese friends and thoroughly enjoyed the evening of excellent beer (2-for-1 offer of draft half liter of beer for 68 yuan), great setting for discussion, attentive service. Food (potato wedges and pizza) was only marginal though.","4 из 5 кружков","6A78AF4961709A904765507F431D519D","Отзыв написан 10 января 2017"
"As I wrote in the titel, it was really good. We have been here very spontaneous. Sunday evening, hungry for good food! So we decided to come here and enjoy some authentic German dishes. The atmosphere is really nice and it was very good to talk as it wasn't too noisy. The food was really nice presented and very tasty....

"Went to their location next to the Laoshe Tea House. I've never been to a vegan restaurant and so I was not so sure before I came here. The dinner turned out to be amazing.

This is obviously exacerbated by not speaking Chinese. So it comes at no surprise that so many others like ourselves found this chain of vegan...

"such a relief to find good veggie fare in BJ. and real veggie fare - not tofu cooked in beef stock etc. the whole menu is vegan so despite the titles referring to animal parts you can be confident the whole affair is veggie safe. 4 of us ate - the portions are big, and nothing was left. excellent value....

"The restaurant looked homely, but stylish. They had a lot of choice on the menu, from tofu dishes to imitation fish and meat. We had a hard time choosing between these ;) The food we eventually ordered was really good and it wasn't too expensive, we paid 76 rmb each (we were with 3) for a lot of food.","4 из 5 кружков","5EACA8ADBE67AEAD68422F17DF391809","Отзыв написан 2 августа 2016"

"Although tucked away, persevere to find it because the menu has an excellent range of imaginative vegan dishes. The avacado with chopped Apple & soya yogurt, drizzled with plum sauce was simply delicious. The friendly service makes for the calm atmosphere & the staff pay great attention to detail. I look forward to going again!","5 из 5 кружков","0D3197178316C02FEDF03DA7E7B2AC6B","Отзыв написан 22 марта 2016"

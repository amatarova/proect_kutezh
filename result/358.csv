"We went with high expectation to order some south Indian food of the menu, but were refused as the restaurant does not prepare dishes from the menu, as they were serving only Buffet. We did not had any choice as we were hungry and tired, the buffet food was not that great as it was not made fresh. Kind of...

"I've been living in Beijing for almost 8 years now and had frequented various Indian food restaurants regularly. I have to say that Indian Kitchen def has the edge compared to the others I have tried. The curries all have their own distinct color, which sound funny but its weird if you order curry and they are all basically the...

"An old haunt that toned down a bit its crisp Indian flavors. The food now seems to be a bit shallower in taste, yet still tasty. With many more Indian tourists in China, inevitably a group may be at the restaurant. It adds to the atmosphere.","4 из 5 кружков","8037B98DF28F7A826BF98F068F839E0E","Отзыв написан 13 апреля 2016"
"Finding Pakistani or Indian food in Beijing is difficult task especially if you are particular about having the real taste food; It is located in diplomatic area of Beijing and very near to Iranian Embassy, in front of a narrow river which add beauty to this restaurants location. My hotel was a 20 minute walk from Indian Kitchen but it...

"Someone in the hotel recommended this India restaurant. The food was nice but did not taste totally Indian. The chicken biryani, raita, chana masala and naan were good. The staff were attentive.

"Although the buffet was not a bad experience I believe that ordering separately can be cheaper and taste better as you select the dishes yourself. Disadvantage of buffet over otherwise :-Student card cannot be used on buffet but can be used otherwise for discount Naan offered on everyone's tables isn't soft. Buffet price:-60 yuan A good range of choice in...

"Being a avid lover of Indian food, our experience of visiting Indian kitchen Beijing branch was way below my expectations. The both naans we ordered were burnt, the chicken tikka masala wasn't that good the taste was wierd and no where close to delicious.

"I'm a big fan. But possibly today wasn't Indian Kitchen's moment of glory. The buffet food was cold and seemed a bit average. Though plentiful. The staff in the restaurant were a bit zealous at taking away my plates etc. Maybe today was a public holiday and maybe the A team were not around. I don't know but please improve...

"This place offers a variety of food; they have great salad, fantastic quiche, fresh croissants, nice pastries and lovely cakes. In addition they have some hot dishes like Thai curry. They also have a variety of breads and loaves of course. The coffee is very good. The seating is comfortable and there is plenty of space. Prices are reasonable.","5 из 5 кружков","69AFC96B1C10C002CC71A34CF79870E9","12 февраля 2017"
"Recently visited with a group of friends after a morning shopping trip and was delighted to come across this cafe which offered a wide selection of beautiful cakes and pastries. I tried the lemon meringue tart which was delicious. The atmosphere was great, busy and full of westerners. This is a great place for a light lunch or an afternoon...

"After waiting in the line for someone to show up at the counter they got my order wrong and let someone else skip the line. The soup was ""enriched"" by a piece of plastic so I sent it back. I also got the spaghetti, simply average. Owner of Baker & Spice, this message is for you: please improve your management...

"Tried the mung bean and kale salad. The flavor was nice - not too salty and not oily. However, I bit into a tiny piece of rock in my last bite...","4 из 5 кружков","AF45F27D0AD4DA4032EC3AAF7A61804A","Отзыв написан 20 января 2017"

"Been here almost every other weekend for the past few months...mainly on the morning after the night before. The place is always buzzing and alive without being overly crowded. The staff are friendly, welcoming and will try their very best to converse with you either in English or Mandarin. There is a great range of baked goods, breads, sandwiches and...

"If you are looking for a place with ""real"" bread, at least European style, this is the place for you. Variety of panini, quiches, cheese cakes, breads, salads and grear juices...service ok and modern location.","4 из 5 кружков","2A7006795B2902C6757E0B4D9ABDF0B5","Отзыв написан 23 августа 2016"
"The bakery is inside the mall. It has many choices, including vegetarian ones. I had a quiche and pastry, and a fresh squeezed juice. They were excellent. I wanted to go back, but unfortunately did not have time. Perfect breakfast, brunch or lunch. Staff is very nice and helpful.","5 из 5 кружков","16C8877E2EA1D35F474746204FF637B7","Отзыв написан 24 июля 2016"
"Lucky for this place their breads are good enough to bring folk back, and Beijinger locals are not fussy on service. An urban vibe and space feeling are not enough to get past the following basic flaws. The service is shocking, surly and chaotic. One visit here will confirm for you these guys are clueless on how to run a...

"Baker & Spice offers quite tasty baked goods and coffee, but it's a pretty penny to pay for both. Their DRC spot is great for a breakfast or coffee meet up. It beats the local competition on espresso beverages, breads and pastries, but not as a lunch spot. If you want a slice of European style snacks, or a place...

"Accidently discovered this place. I got out from Liangma qiao station and saw this and entered. I picked up some sliced bread and a muffin. The bread was fresh and the muffin just as I wanted it. It has a big choice of items and you can eat a salad or some sandwhich. You need to self order and wait...

"Baker and Spice at the Grand Summit near Yansha Qiao is a branch of chain which is very big in Shanghai, and has recently set up in Beijing. The cafe is spacious and trendy, and seems like a perfect place to chill out. However, while the atmosphere is great, food and service are extremely poor. Perhaps as a Bakery and...

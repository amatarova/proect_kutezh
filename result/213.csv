"Good Beijing duck in this typical chinese restaurant. Clean look and good choice of dishes. The only bad point was the heating who was really high!!","4 из 5 кружков","C5E788C344493DD79CD22A68B442F481","12 марта 2017"

"I have been to many Quanjude restaurants, but this was not the best so far. Interior somewhat torn and worn, the service somewhat sloppy and the food absolutely not tasty.","2 из 5 кружков","46A3528EDAA28DA02D2E221790EA552F","7 марта 2017"
"I ate peking duck 3 times while in Beijing and this was the best one. It was also the most expensive, but I believe it was worth the price. The presentation was excellent. The duck was carved in front of me and displayed as a flower on the table. The server showed me how to eat the duck with the...

"The menu we got was entirely in Chinese, and the waitress told us we couldn't order one of the Duck things, but we should order what Google Translate was telling us is a ""Duck Peony"". We thought that since there was only 3 of us we couldn't order the whole duck or something, so we just went with it and...

"I have not yet completed a full tour of all the amazing duck places there are to try in Beijing, but so far I find this place to be my favorite. Large space with lots of different rooms. Staff were friendly - when we went it was around the spring equinox and they were offering diners the chance to try...

"To day I was treated to a fantastic meal at this restaurant by my friends. The restaurant is big but divided into smaller sections that makes it more intimate. First you are treated with a pot of hot boiled water. It is good for the thirst and also for your stomach. We had the Beijing duck, some fish dish and...

"I got lucky and was treated to this delicious famous dish during a business trip, and now it's my most memorable taste of Beijing. You have to try the duck skin, it's magical the way it melts away like candy.","5 из 5 кружков","EE43E873A9A275BCC7D9C4DB3D3D6A62","Отзыв написан 14 августа 2016"
"It was my first experience eating peking duck. I love how they brought the duck to our table and sliced it there. The premium part where they cut first was oily, but the fragrance was irresistable! The meat was just nice and when wrapped together with onion and the sauce, it was nice as well! We asked for the remaining...

"We've been here a couple of times, and both visits we were surprised that it was crowded with locals. The duck was served well, and side dishes were fine. Personally I think the duck at XIang Man Lou (also popular with locals) is more flavorful, and you have much better side dish options. But Quan Ju De is a comfortable...

"It was next door to the Hilton so I grabbed a fast meal the night I arrived. My food was mediocre and I was tired so just ate and left. The next night my colleagues and I all went out looking for Peking duck. Despite my reservations we went here. It was dreadful. The duck was pretty tasteless, the food...

"Restaurant was a bit cold but they turned om the heat for us. They didn't speak a lick of English but we had a guide which helped tremendously. Food came out in the opposite order because the duck we preordered wasnt ready yet. Would have preferred to wait and get the duck first. The food besides the duck was just...

"Went to this place to enjoy a Beijing Duck. Unfortunately, it was nit great. Served cold and with very small portion (we had a half duck for 2 and it was not enough). The rest of the food was blend and without interest.","2 из 5 кружков","303494F6759C3EDB5A907C5CEA55650B","Отзыв написан 17 января 2016"
"This restaurant has quite a few branches in Beijing and we had been close to the one at Hilton Beijing. We ordered the Beijing duck and the spicy prawns amongst other things. The food taste was simply awesome, eating with chopsticks was also a unique experience. Must visit place for meat lovers!","4 из 5 кружков","D51C8F26D4017271D54F88C5A39A9E6B","Отзыв написан 12 января 2016"

"There are several branches of Quanjude Roast Duck restaurants in Beijing...this one is not well-known, but is the place where the locals eat duck. So truly authentic. To locate the restaurant - it is just off the 3rd ring near the Hilton hotel. We had the duck set menu which comes with the usual accompaniments - and is served with...

"I understand this was THE place to go for Peking DUck in the 90s. The place could use a renovation but still in pretty good shape. The food was great, one of the better Peking Ducks I have had. The other food on the rotating table was also very taste so if you are now super conscious about a top...

"There are places where you can get Beijing Duck that is cheaper and just as good but there is none better. This is a newer location that is beautifully decorated, has an attentive staff and great food. Their signature roast duck is phenomenal but they also serve great fish and other dishes. This is the most well known Beijing duck...

"We had already tried one renowned establishment in Beijing for roast duck, and enjoyed it but had not been so impressed by the service, so decided to try another. Our taxi driver suggested this branch of Quanjude, and it was really a great disappointment. It was around 8 pm.and there were no free tables in the main front dining area,...

"If you like duck this is one of the few famous restaurant to try. Tradition and way of raising and preparing the duck is a great story. Food is ok and service is prompt. Clean and safe restaurant. You need to experience it at least one day but I will not eat is regularly.","4 из 5 кружков","34E9DEABAA88B759E0069047E26DE610","Отзыв написан 1 апреля 2015"
"It's was 22 years ago when I moved to Beijing for a 3 year stint as an expat and during that time I enjoyed many a meal at the Quanjude Duck restaurant. Having an opportunity to travel to Beijing on business and to see my son who is now working in Beijing. It was the distant memories of Beijing Duck...

"If you expect great Peking Duck - eat it in USA! I was disappointed as I expected the duck in Beijing to taste much better. In Chinese style restaurants in US the duck is much better.

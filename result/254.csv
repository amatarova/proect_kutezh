"The restaurant is a little hidden in a back street. ItТs behind SchillerТs (where УNearby the treeФ was). The dining area is a big room sporting a cool graffiti painting on the largest wall. The food came quick. I hade Quesadila with Beef, but the Guacamole was way too less. The salsa of the Tacos, which we had a starter,...

"After living in China for 1.5 years, our family misses Tex Mex food the most! We looked this place up and made the journey. We were the only ones their for lunch but the food was great! Chips were perhaps a little stale but everything else was excellent, including the margaritas!","5 из 5 кружков","8B42E68C894485AD854F35D5141A8D9E","ќтзыв написан 18 декабр€ 2016"
"Off in a side street in the Sanlitun area stands Lucky Lopez. I love all the windows and it open feel. I had soft shell chicken and my wife had a taco salad. The food fresh and delicious and very affordable. We also had a nice conversation with the owner who personally overseas the operation. I recommend you give Lucky...

"This is a great find, afordable good food and service in this area. Similar to a California style mexican fast food restaurant, they have rice platters, tacos, or burritos. All plentyful and good. You select your own toppings. I was disappointed in that they did not have cheese available as a topping.","4 из 5 кружков","B22583E69F45228CAC62CA0B021E1F90","ќтзыв написан 5 окт€бр€ 2016"
"Been here 3 times recently in less than 3 weeks and I keep coming back. Always go for the chicken burrito because I know how good it is. I'm sure everything else is just as tasty and will hopefully try something different soon. Not to forget the great horchata which goes down well with the food. Highly recommend this place...

"I went to Lucky Lopez on the recommendation of a friend, and I wasn't disappointed! The vibe is relaxing, and the decor is hip and fun. It is so popular that I couldn't get a seat outside, but I found lounge seating inside. I don't speak Chinese, but everyone was friendly and helpful with my ordering. Service is top-notch. I...

"Damn, my favorite Tex-Mex place moved to the Sanlitun area. I had to search for the new location, but it is No.34A Sanlitun South Road. Same great food, but it looks like it is geared more to a night-life style place than just lunch. They now have a full bar to go with the Margaritas, and a funky new look....

"Used to get lucky Lopez delivery at least 3 times a week when I worked in Beijing. Can't beat the value, burritos for 24rmb and they're big! Simple but tasty and they aren't shy with their meat.. Definite five stars","5 из 5 кружков","1219D34FCDEA220114B05A8A1261C1FA","ќтзыв написан 7 июн€ 2016"

"My office is near by..so when I am in town and want a little Mexican fix..this does the trick. It's Chipotle..Beijing style. Great taste. Great quality. Amazing prices. VERY clean. Owner is from TX and brings seasonings straight from the US..that is amazing. Love it and hope they are always there when I'm in town.","5 из 5 кружков","C229146A9C881C5037FF84DADA4451CE","ќтзыв написан 29 марта 2015"
"Lucky Lopez is pretty much modeled after Chipotle, and it does a decent job of that. The few times I've been here, the place is always clean, the staff are friendly, and the food is delicious. SUPER BONUS: they deliver for free. They have (what sounds like) a native-English speaker who they pass the phone to every time I call...

"I was in Jianwie Soho for a meeting and saw this gem of a restuarant. Food wasgreat and dirt cheap. Clean and friendly. Everything that you need. Chipotle-like in Beijing. Can't complain at all.","5 из 5 кружков","56DBDD04DA7D4C715B50A70018B0CF0A","ќтзыв написан 24 €нвар€ 2014"

"These guys don't know the English (or Spanish) name for anything Mexican, but it doesn't matter. It's one of those places you can point at what you want and when it's delivered it's fantastic for tacos, burritos and the salads on other tables looked alright too. Dirt cheap, everything 20-something RMB. Looks clean.","5 из 5 кружков","8F2053F9790CE6F7E84FEC1ABE57D78C","ќтзыв написан 20 феврал€ 2013"

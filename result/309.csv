"That's a very popular place as it serves many excellent dishes and at a very good price. The menu has English names for the dishes, but staff don't necessarily speak English. Highly recommended","4 из 5 кружков","EBEF3DE0B694276594E6CC49458D327B","Отзыв написан 26 мая 2016"
"This place has no shortage of guests, often with a wait. People lined up on little stools waiting outside the restaurant in the mall. Once you make your way inside you find out some of the attraction. The menu has a diverse selection of items and as you look at some of the dishes on the tables, or being delivered...

"All the food was tasty and well prepared. Staff delightful, if a little reticent to speak English. Can get busy. Very good value. They offer one wine, a cabernet sauvignon, for 96 yuan, which is chinese and excellent. It is one of a chain of restaurants, but don't let that put you off. Comfortable seating and you maybe lucky to...

"Not far from the Grand Millennium hotel this an inexpensive way to dine out. We were joined by two young local girls as the place was full. They spoke little English and we spoke no Mandarin but we never stopped laughing. The food is easy to order as you fill out a form after looking at the menu with a...

"A pretty standard selection of Chinese dishes from different regions. Average flavor, average service but cheap (that's what Chinese consumers look in the first place), many dishes to select and very standard flavor. For money-saver it's a must.","3 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 28 апреля 2015"
"If you are in Beijing, you should definitely visit Grean Tea. The atmosphere is fresh and pleasant but the real gold is the food. The menu is very large and has very traditional Chinese dishes but with a modern twist. Everything is executed to perfection and is not only beautifully plated but is also incredibly tasty. We had an assortment...

"This restaurant is a favorite among Beijingers. It is always full, and they don't take reservations. If you want a table for dinner you must get there between 6:00-6:30pm. If you arrive late you might have to wait 40 minutes or more for a table. The big draw is the food. It is the best food I have tasted in...

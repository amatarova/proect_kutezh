"We found this on trip advisor and instantly decided it to be a ""must-do"" during our trip to Beijing. We had a hard time finding it but then read all of the comments below talking about the real location. Once we arrived we were very happy. Again- not an exact replica but pretty cool to see. We had a few...

"I had read reviews about this place, that described it as an almost perfect replica. It is not. However, it is still a good visit! Worth taking the time to go visit.","4 из 5 кружков","FE07681BDE531FD9E347CBE0EEFE61C5","Отзыв написан 18 ноября 2016"
"I just stepped back into the 90s with this cafe. This is one of the best recommendations of gotten for Beijing, although not a local attraction it's worth the trip!","5 из 5 кружков","6A43F2DB390A9DFC52414953D999CA75","Отзыв написан 13 октября 2016"
"As described by the other reviewers, this is essentially a cafe that is designed to resemble a cafe from a TV show that was popular in North America (maybe at least a decade ago). (There is a second room that is made to look like another setting in the show as well). Truthfully, I was never a big fan of...

"True to form - looks exactly like the ""Friends"" TV set. They also play episodes of friends non stop. White sitting in the well replicated place, there is a good, tasty offerings of pastries and coffees to munch on a drink from. A bit hard to find as this is on the 6th floor of a building. I also strongly...

"I have seen all ten seasons of friends and thoroughly enjoyed just taking in the surroundings at Central Perk. The place is small but the resemblance is amazing, and they serve a pretty good cappuccino (sometimes hard to find in Beijing). As someone living here for a while, who gets homesick sometimes, I loved sitting on the friends couch, watching...

"My Chinese wife loves the TV sitcom Friends. In fact, her English vocabulary improved greatly just by watching the episodes over and over again. It’s funny when I hear her use an idiom and I stop to think where she learned that as I haven’t taught her that idiom and the answer undoubtedly is from friends. Therefore we heard about...

"This is a amazing little place, a little hard to find, descriptions below. Well worth it-you really feel like you are in the Friends cafe, they have repeats on the TV of all the episodes and they have good priced tea and coffee on offer too. Don't forget to check out the apartment next door-Joey and Chandler's place-I ran around...

"I visited Central Perk during my trip to Beijing and it was totally worth it! I LOVED IT and it was the perfect end to my trip to Beijing. Ok so first, getting here. It is difficult to find and I got lost initially because I brilliantly got off at the wrong train station the first time and walked aimlessly...

"After finally finding the the cafe was hard without wifi, great replica set for the cafe and jokey and chandlers room, staff very friendly and helpful letting us into the joey and chandlers room, got to sit on the sofa, prices weren't a rip off either, would recommend and you can play the guitar, cuddle the penguin and watch friends...

"Being an American in Beijing on business, one of the girls I work with said we needed to go. I went and it was incredible. The inside is spot on Central Perk from the show. Really cool. They have it all..good coffee, good cupcakes, and great staff and prices. Definitely a place to get away for an hour.","5 из 5 кружков","C229146A9C881C5037FF84DADA4451CE","Отзыв написан 29 марта 2015"
"It's incredible that such a impressive cafe exists in Beijing. Someone is obviously a big fan of the show, because once you're there, you're really there on the show. It's not just the attention detail, but the feel of the cafe. Yes, it actually's good as a working cafe too, although it feels more cosy than what you see on...

"I went to this place on a friends recommendation. She warned me about the eh coffee and the decent desserts. So I went and average is what I got. The atmosphere was good..people inside were very into themselves. The waitresses need to learn about customer service and to smile. The owner needs to not hit on the waitresses and hit...

"Some people might think that this place is lame and a knock off etc etc. But to be honest it's a fun place to go. It's small but nice and the food is decent. It is VERY hard to find so if you are looking for it be careful. Google maps has it in the wrong location. The address here...

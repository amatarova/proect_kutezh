"Had a late brunch and was disappointing food I had. Ordered Big American item and the food was served dry and cold!!! Looks like they forgot to serve it on time that's why quality was low. The overall restaurant is just ok, big enough that you feel empty! Choose to sit with natural daylight area. I'm hesitant to return to...

"When we were living in Shanghai I used to go here every third day. The food is always good and I can promise anyone will find food from the menu. Smoothies and fresh juices is a must.

"The dishes are not extraordinary, but they are good. Definitely something to tuck into if you are having a long day at work and want a good midday meal.

"This restaurant is attached to the Galleria Mall. They have indoor and outdoor seating. If the weather is nice, or in the evening it's nice to sit outdoors. The restaurant is clean and has nice decor. This is a western style restaurant so if you are yearning for food that is more familiar, this is the place for you. I...

"Some of their food can be bland. This is a trendy place which relies on their name to draw customers. A little pricey for what you get! Service can be hit or miss, but mostly the servers just do their jobs.","3 из 5 кружков","993FD81DB22D4F6E5D92539152359218","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2015"

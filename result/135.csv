"Undoubtedly the views and general setting are extremely pleasant, however beyond that everything starts to go down hill. The menu is a combination of western and Chinese dishes, with no real theme or continuity. The food was not bad, however was probably my least satisfying meal during my week in Beijing, whilst also being the most expensive. There are far...

Creamed spinach was nice, but very creamy, too much after the bisque, I should have chosen something lighter.

"Definitely a go-to place after a hectic day spent shopping at APM Mall! We had Margherita pizza and non veg platter. Food was okay - okay. The quantities were quite good but it was not delicious to be honest. The food did not last as per our expectations. We ordered 2 drinks which were nice. The ambiance of the outlet...

"Cool vibe in this restaurant but average food. We had spaghetti which was all in incredibly creamy sauce. We liked it at first but it was just too rich to eat much. Salad fresh but unimaginative. French fries fantastic. Garlic bread was horrid - made with very soft bread that was very sweet.","3 из 5 кружков","997995A31FA2A3F83A27C2CFB1F2946D","Отзыв написан 22 августа 2016"
"Vintage industrial decor, huge place, free wifi, nice music and great atmosphere. They don't have a wide selection of pizzas, but the ones we tried were amazing. BBQ spicy chicken (kind of small) was delicious, and the tomato and cheese deep crust was awesome (108 yuans). You have to try the strawberry & soda drink served in a little jar...

"The restaurant itself has a new, modern feel. The music choices are strange - it sounds like Saturday night at a bar, minus the volume. The service is good. The pizza itself was limp. The base was very thin and soft. The toppings were OK. I think the other pizza place in the APM or even pizza hut are better...

"9 Road Pizzeria has a few locations in Beijing offering up an ecclectic mix of Western inspired food. Their take on the diavola pizza is great, as is their creamy carbonara pasta (served in a bread bowl if you want to be really indulgent). Kids ate happily, as did the adults in our large crowd. We were also pleased to...

"This is a Korean-style pizza restaurant, just in case people think of the name as an Italian or American restaurant. They have plenty varieties of food; pizza, pasta, some chickens as well. We love the rocket salad pizza that they have and the platters they have (BBQ or fried chicken). For the platter, you can share between 3 people, it...

"We loved the atmosphere here, especially watching the young people coming and going. The pizza was non traditional. The sweet potato pizza used the potatoes as the crust. While delicious, it was very unusual. We had the black sesame salad which could have served four and it was also very good. They also had yummy fruit juices and great French...

"Nice to have a non Asian meal in Beijing. Big menu and good service. I had a burger and fries with a beer. only real complaint was the meals came out at different times and they weren't busy to handle 2 meals at the same time.","5 из 5 кружков","0B274E98E7AA888556973B2152F4AC45","Отзыв написан 23 марта 2016"
"Despite a good service and a good atmosphere, I have been really disappointed by the 58 CNY pizza. I expected an american-style pizza with thick dough ... But it was more like a french-style or german-style flammekueche. Maybe a bad choice for me, but for a restaurant call ""something pizza"" ... Could be improved !","3 из 5 кружков","7809FBBEBADB4E51F841A887B5E4C59F","Отзыв написан 11 февраля 2016"

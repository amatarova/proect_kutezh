"I have written one review before for this Bar but having just returned from another trip i have to reiterate what a great bar and even better host Eric is. Hidden just off the main road down one of the Hutongs The drinks here are based around the usual spirits that have been brilliantly infused with some wonderful ingredients. Vodka...

"I've been lucky enough to travel a fair deal, I can't honestly say Eric's cocktails are some of the best I've ever had. If you're in Beijing you have to visit, it's that simple. You will not regret it!","5 из 5 кружков","6316BBA75E11D0737742B0C3DB350E32","Отзыв написан 3 октября 2016"
"It's a little hard to find down a dark (but safe!) alleyway but well worth the effort. Delicious and interesting cocktails for only about 40rmb or so and pretty good pizza too. Staff are really friendly and knowledgeable and speak very good English. It's also about the only place in China we found a nice glass of wine for a...

"My friends and I went out and decided to try this place before we went to dinner. Drinks were fantastic, atmosphere was lovely and the owner (Eric, as I recall) was so nice. I would highly recommend checking it out!","5 из 5 кружков","CD32B86B43E1981C5B82CD0D30A72F3B","Отзыв написан 28 мая 2016"
"Mao Mao Chong is great. The service was wonderful, and Eric, the owner, went above and beyond to make sure our drinks were on point. The cocktails were fun, and many of the classics have some unique spins with Chinese ingredients. I didn't eat, but the food looked good. I'll definitely go back! FYI- Cash only!","5 из 5 кружков","2A2D19929A12E5DCB61D6AC09876B17A","Отзыв написан 25 мая 2016"
"Thanks Eric Genuinely amazing and sublime cocktails. Often classics with the owners twist of cleverly infused spirits using ingredients such as sichuan pepper, ginger, lemon grass and many other local treats. If you are in Beijing i would highly recommend coming here to try some of the best cocktails in Beijing. Pizza ain't half bad either!! See you next year","5 из 5 кружков","A80A860C9708D5641C6A3B7C87B64E71","Отзыв написан 8 декабря 2015"

"Came here upon recommendations online. Seems like a local hangout for expats. Manager is very friendly and makes good drink suggestions. Would hang out here often if I lived nearby.","5 из 5 кружков","8141016CD91D6583E35471D5259F5A16","Отзыв написан 19 ноября 2015"
"Not much to say here except add to your list of must visits for Beijing. Eric, the owner and bartender, makes some of the best cocktails you'll taste. Anywhere. Its a small bar, but a cosy friendly atmosphere. The food is also excellent - be prepared to wait though, it's worth it. Go, drink, eat and enjoy one of Beijing's...

"Taking Lonely Planets' advice we went here to eat a pizza, a descent pizza, knowing up front it wouldn't be greasy or cardboard. It was good indeed. The cheapest draft beer was somewhat expensive, but proved to be a good Belgian 'witbier'. Two beers and two pizzas damaged us for about 200 Yuan. The WiFi is free, though quite slow...

"Owner and master barman Eric knows what the hell he is doing. He makes drinks that are insanely amazing, he's attentive to detail and go there a few times and he'll get a pretty good handle on what your tastes are. And these pizza are ridiculous. They are made with quality products which is apparent from the first to the...

"Used to go here all the time. Great pizza (which is award winning for a reason), amazing cocktails (award winning for a reason), and great service. This is a place you don't rush in and out of. You can arrive at 6 and leave at close, and feel like you have hardly been there. Very hipster and fun. All in...

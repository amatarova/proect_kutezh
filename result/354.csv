"I am not sure which branch we ate at but it was in a 2nd storey of a small building. We had buffet here. There were plenty of choices, they refill food rather quickly. I enjoyed the maki's they served. Otheres were mostly fried food that were just okay. They also served a sashimi platter per table. While it was...

"Excellent Japanese offerings at this hotel restaurant. Sushi and sashimi are very good as well as the other appetizers. Yakitori and grilled fish were perfect, too! Surprisingly, prices were reasonable!","4 из 5 кружков","60F89F288FF25558E586B6770F9B5BB8","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2016"
"This is my 3rd time here and all the time I enjoyed the food served here. It is almost next to Japanese Embassy in Beijing which is probably why it is authentic. We had sushi and sashimi, this time. the sushi selection was really tasty.","5 из 5 кружков","70B3C5D1C8267D5E1C007A3A00074A48","Отзыв написан 22 мая 2016"
"Menu is pretty standard for sushi restaurants with some nice combination dishes. The food was very good although I have had better (including in Beijing) and service was good ,but not great. Factor in the reasonable prices and its a very good sushi option.","4 из 5 кружков","2F6E7FC32D6092FDB5092DFD19FAC624","Отзыв написан 18 апреля 2016"
"Sushi, tempura, cooked fish and meat - are all excellent - consistently so. Service is very good and even the tea is great. Very wide variety - you can get lost in the menu. Check the various locations to find a convenient one. As always, getting a taxi after dinner requires patience.","5 из 5 кружков","8037B98DF28F7A826BF98F068F839E0E","Отзыв написан 13 апреля 2016"
"I specifically like the buffet with ample sushi sampling selection. Alternatively, I like the lunch specials with beef and rice. This is a restaurant where it is important to arrive early otherwise one has to wait to be seated.","5 из 5 кружков","0D6FADE26E192085D947B05C6A4C987B","Отзыв написан 18 марта 2016"

"Sashimi was fresh and so were some of the other dishes. Really nothing fantastic about this place if you are a traveler except for the good and fresh Sashimi which is hard to find in Beijing since it is quite a distance from the seacoast.","3 из 5 кружков","B11EEB5FC6E232D21E45D0F373C88009","Отзыв написан 22 июня 2014"
"I am a creature of habits and have found this japanese restaurant to deliver consistently an excellent sashimi experience. The staff is always very helpful and the atmosphere is quaint despite the fairly large foot-print. I highly recommend as a dining option once you've had your share of Chinese dinners.","5 из 5 кружков","9152F15C6884C503B1F66489EB62C4F6","Отзыв написан 9 мая 2014"
"And I'm not a sushi lover. After doing my research online decided to give it a go. Apparently they have 5 branches within few miles radius, not sure which one we have been to, but according to the restaurant manager the interior, food quality and prices are all the same. It wasn't the cheapest, for two people with few bears...

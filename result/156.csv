"Was told to go there as it was a lively bar. Got there around 9:45, we were only couple people around this bar. The barmen were not even interested into serving. The band was good. The bar manager showed up, great guy! He motivated his troops and this was a good move as suddenly this whole bar filled quickly! The...

"Many hip and cool people at this bar. Located in the Rosewood hotel and it matched the vibe and feel of this cool hotel. Definitely an expensive place to get a drink, but you'll get what u pay for.","5 из 5 кружков","130EAED5173A41AB2151DEAB7D1A9EA7","Отзыв написан 29 октября 2016"

"This isn't the place to go to if you want a cheap night out, but it was a lot of fun! It was cool to have a live band, and they did a great job filling the dance floor.","4 из 5 кружков","6910043962CC138AF8E2B6FE872C5F60","Отзыв написан 13 сентября 2016"
"One of Beijing's consistently best night spots, with live American R&B and Funk, a hopping dance floor, eclectic and mixed clientele of young locals, visiting business people, beautiful people, and folks out just to cut loose and have a great time. Almost anything goes in the bar or on the dance floor. Great mixologists, boss cocktail list, outdoor seating for...

"You get what you pay for. I find the drinks to be on the expensive side. The drinks are good but not out of this world and too sweet for me. On the flip side, a lot of places in Beijing that serve cheaper use fake alcohol so it's worth it just to have a sense of security. The chicken...

"Wanted to have a drink at the bar before dinner at the same hotel, but had to wait for the manager at the door because staff was not sure and couldn't decide whether my leather sandals (not flip flops) were appropriate for this bar, which, by the way, was empty. So, as they couldn't decide themselves, we had to wait...

"Fresh attitude though the drink menus are exhaustive, as you’d expect from any hotel bar worth its salt. Wines range from the common to the truly exceptional, with prices to match (80RMB and up, all prices subject to 15 percent service charge). The whisky selection is very good. Awesome house band, spectacular view, and quite good for a non-expected party...

"large lounge type bar, excellent selection of drinks. staff very attentive. seperated into 3 sections, main bar with live music. good selection of western tracks , just the right volume to give atmosphere but not so loud that you cannot hold a conversation. 2nd part is more lounge with couches and tables. 3rd is a very nice outdoor area where...

"Went there a week ago, the cocktail list is not extensive, probably about 10-12 cocktails to select from, I ordered the cucumber cooler cocktail, it was nice but a tad too sweet. Since there was nothing much to choose from the cocktail list my friend and I decided to share a bottle of pinot noir. The waiter did not offer...

"Visited the MEI bar at the Beijing Rosewood with a couple of colleagues while in town on business in October 2015. I first came across the Rosewood in London as it is home to one of the top cocktail bars in the city and I would put MEI in the same ballpark. This is a very chic place attracting an...

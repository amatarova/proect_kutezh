"It was like a mirage amid all the unrecognizable foods. Service was great, food was great. Prices were reasonable. After a few days in China, I thought I would drop dead from malnutrition. This place was just what we needed. Familiar food, taste good, looks good, and smells good.","4 из 5 кружков","96C48BACC99CB9405EAD66BD0B4AE725","Отзыв написан 24 апреля 2014"

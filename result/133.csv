"We enjoyed a wonderfully different meal after a week of Chinese food. The preparations are unique and very tasty - aimed at a wide range of palates. Narrow but excellent selection of sake.","5 из 5 кружков","8822AA62FF054C5F5C612AEFF8B1C989","Отзыв написан 16 декабря 2016"
"So if you're looking for patient, smiling and polite service, come here. The service was great and any questions I had were answered with a smile. Perfect for a date with cozy dim lighting and great presentation. Food was very fresh. Jazz music is soothing and provides a great backdrop for conversation at the bar or the dining table. The...

"The restaurant business is cut throat in Beijing, especially in the highly popular Sanlitun area. To survive multiple years, as Okra has done, takes dedication and consistency. It is clear that the team behind Okra has both, and I hope that you will make the time and budget to discover why. Tucked neatly into the second floor of one of...

"This is an extraordinary place set in the lovely 1949 complex, the chef was away when I was there but the GM Diana is a master in her own right - she chose what I should eat and drink and everything was excellent. A must go to place in Beijing, particularly for dinner.","5 из 5 кружков","6E0B1DF3D59FF4D0427BB71C32771421","Отзыв написан 10 июня 2016"

"The food and service at Okra 1949 is second to none in Beijing. Opt for one of the set menus and enjoy the experience. Some of the best sushi to boot and they do great eel. They also have a killer sake list.","5 из 5 кружков","A3A373029614F088BDB601086407EDA6","Отзыв написан 7 марта 2016"

"Inventive Japanese cuisine in Beijing - loved the food - also ambience and service.

"I always love Japanese food, so through a recommendation from a friend, we went there for dinner. Food was excellent, the sushi and sashimi were fresh and delicious. The environment was very cosy with very good service. Although the price was on the high side, it was nevertheless a fine experience and worth the visit. Highly recommended if you are...

"I am not an expert on Japanese cuisine by any means but after 20+ years of dining out around the world, I do have a taste for dishes that are made with exquisite detail by a consummate chef from the freshest/finest ingredients. Okra offers that type of experience. More than that, it is on a very short list of Beijing...

"The whole of 1949 is a breath of fresh air, but Okra makes it so much better. The place looks very good. As a professional, I really liked their design.

"My husband and I heard about Okra from a reliable western chef in Beijing.Then we kept hearing great things about this place. Only after our experience at Koy Shunka, our favorite sushi restaurant in Barcelona, had I decided to visit to Okra. Wow, we fell in love with the place right away! We enjoy watching Chef Max and his assistants...

"My cocktail was very good, i had then several food courses but i was not impressed. I don't Want to say that the food was ordinary, but I can not place this restaurant in the level of the same restaurant in Japan. For my opinion the proportion between the rice and the Fish are not in line with the best...

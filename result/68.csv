"Most of the food is good, atmosphere is good, location is good at the center of the Sanlitun embassy area, although it can be a little tricky to find (it's on the 2nd floor of a nondescript building). Prices are a little high but managable.","4 из 5 кружков","CE4ACC13FDFFC87F5572E2C256753A7F","17 февраля 2017"

"After eating in so many different style restaurants, it was so good to go back to good Israeli food. The menu has about any kind of Israeli food you could think of.

"A very peculiar place to visit, and totally recommended to go if you will stay in Beijing for some days. A mixture between Arab (Moroccan, Egyptian..) and Mediterranean (like... Greek?) food, good taste and affordable price. This place is located between both Sections of Sanlitun Village (yeah... that small bars street). Use Subway Line 10 / Tuanjiehu stations, Exit A.","4 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 16 сентября 2016"

"If you are looking for an alternative restaurant to the local ones and eager for top notch middle eastern food this is THE place for you in Beijing. It's definitely not the typical middle eastern restaurant you're expecting with the usual Shawarma/gyros stand, etc,. but much more a western or cosmopolitan ambient place that serves some of the best dishes...

"I've been coming here for four years and in my opinion, the best lunch place in Beijing. The homemade mint lemonade is a must which goes with the excellent food.

"First, Bite a pitta makes the best hummus in town. That's a given. They have great falafels, their lamb skewers are always fresh, juicy and flavorful, and coincidentally they make one of the best cups of coffee in town (if you like heavy and sweet Turkish style coffee, that is). It''s definitely the best middle eastern food in the area...

"Great wine by the glass! Happy hour includes a free taco. During the week it's everyday, Friday and Saturday 17:00-19:00 I believe! Tacos were great, a lot of choices and flavors! Several types of hot sauces but they need a hotter one! All were very mild for me! Will be going back and the prices were reasonable!","5 из 5 кружков","E47A10AAA7EE52C02CC2DD140452D912","28 февраля 2017"

"Not easy to find and thankfully the very helpful staff guided me, it was just after opening time yet all but 2 of the tables were reserved and it's easy to see why. Simply furnished with a bar-type casual feel, young and friendly servers, very reasonable prices, choice of portion size and good list of alcohol including an excellent local...

"I have been to the Taco Bar a couple of times recently with the wife and children and the food and service is first class .

They opened for dinner at 5, and they were almost packed when we got there. Good food, will come back.","4 из 5 кружков","1862831D15975B6BDC9639C696F3E357","Отзыв написан 6 ноября 2016"

"What a great spot to hangout with friends on the weekend. They have the best guacamole & chips, black bean dip & Mexican corn in Beijing. Great for a small or large group.

"Free taco with drink at happy hour. What, I ask you, what could be better? Not much. The Taco Bar is reliably delicious with outstanding tacos, good chips, and the most amazing white sangria. Truly a happy place. We've come for brunch, lunch, happy hour, and dinner and it never disappoints.","5 из 5 кружков","CCBAEAE5B09DF5B786270F791B91CE67","Отзыв написан 18 октября 2016"
"As a lover of Mexican food, I have been here (and most of the other Mexican places in Beijing) quite a few times, and the great offers keep me coming back. Conveniently located, a great vibe, quirky interior deco. During Happy hour, a cocktail or draught beer gets you a free, albeit not large taco. For me, it's all about...

"First of all they have the best tacos in town and also other dishes (my favorite are the big-a.. prawns) and drinks. The only problem is that the place is full all the time and you have to wait for a long time to be seated. The hostesses like to tell you: come after 9PM so you can find a...

The tacos are soooo tasty, and there is great variety, so even with set combos it's tough to choose. Though you can chock up a free taco if you order the house beer! Great sides - proper guacamole,...

"I live in Shanghai, so I'm judging Taco Bar by China standards. Taco Bar has great ambiance, pretty good service for China, delicious salads, guacamole, and chips.

"The restaurant offers a wide selection of Asian food, good quality and cheap prices (in three, four 4 dishes and drinks we paid 135cny). I would recommend it! The downside is that the waiters hardly speak English, but you can easily point to the menu to order, like anywhere else in China.","4 из 5 кружков","66270DEEC43FCA6AF75D1B84C0596EBE","Отзыв написан 17 декабря 2016"
"Fooled by prior reviews we stopped here for our first meal in China (and it was near our hotel and other upscale hotel). We should have know better when we were welcomed on the street by shills waving menus and entered an unappealing room. The menu (and its pictures) were out of a bad Chinese-American restaurant. The service was chaotic...

"Previous reviews were spot on. We tried this after the previous night doing a chain dumpling restaurant. This was so good we went back a second time for our Beijing duck experience. Both times staff were very helpful, some were gold with English but ordering was very easy from the picture menu. Local beer was tasty (Yanjing). Fried rice, sweet...

"We ate here for 3 out of 4 of the nights we stayed in Beijing. On our second night we tried another restaurant and decided it wasn't nearly as good as this one, so we went back the next two nights. The restaurant was filled with Asian people, which was a good sign. The food is tasty and freshly cooked....

"I came here looking for closure. My wife and I came here a decade ago. She was here on a business trip, I joined her after, and she showed me this amazing restaurant. Three years after she passed away from cancer, I brought our son so he can know what Mommy and Daddy did a decade ago. So I can...

"This popular restaurant offered a great selection of food at very reasonable prices. Staff were very friendly and there was always someone on hand who could communicate in English. We ate here three nights as the hotel was too expensive for what you got. We spoke to other tourists and they also enjoyed and returned to this restaurant. We particularly...

"The veg spread was amazing and the fish was out of this world. To add to the experience was their courteous and ever so helpful staff. Even items not on the menu were brought on special request. Highly recommended for vegetarians visiting China for the first time.","4 из 5 кружков","3073C7ED245BAFD60924C5724D5461F6","Отзыв написан 20 июня 2016"

"Eating at the same restaurant three times was a new experience. Located near the Novotel Beijing Peace it was a refuge after a full day of walking and sight seeing. The menu is expansive, has pictures of each dish with English translation. I can recommend the spring onion pancakes, spicy chicken with peanuts and chill as well as the traditional...

"After a long time looking round for a restaurant that looked appealing, we had almost given up and were heading back to the hotel to eat when we heard a ""hello"" coming from the waitress at a podium outside. We had a quick look at the menu (usual pictures - with English translated text) and boy, are we glad we...

"The clientele is a mix of Chinese and Westerners, and I had the impression many of the latter were local residents or otherwise in the know, so this restaurant does well in the authenticity stakes despite the Wangfujing location. My own impression was that the food was very good (I had crispy duck Gweilin-style, which involved a delicious fruity sauce,...

"This place was recommended by our tour guide. It was a short walk from our hotel and easy to find. It was very busy with mostly locals but no wait to be seated. The fish were swimming until they were removed and taken to you for approval before they met the chef. Peking duck was on the menu and looked...

"Service was fairly attentive. Tableware was clean. Prices are OK although beware they have an English/Chinese menu with a limited selection and higher prices (e.g 32 vs 22 for mantou steamed buns). Four of us ate and drank for around 300 with plenty of leftovers.","3 из 5 кружков","5F1F4F025FC3E859A1356C9316F15A76","Отзыв написан 3 июля 2015"
"Found this restaurant whilst doing a walk-about after checking into our hotel. The wait staff were very polite and attentive and that certainly helped as their command of English was not that great. Patrons were both locals and tourists alike and they were busy throughout. Good tasty food, a great selection of dishes and great ambience made us come back...

"A bit touristic, but still sufficiently traditional and local for me in its character. For the price of a steak in nearby restaurants, two of us had a three course meal (took the scallops and the sizzling peppered beef). Lack of English skills is like everywhere else, sad but nothing to do about it.","3 из 5 кружков","56A7D0B4ADD6F7DA2987D7442429729D","Отзыв написан 6 мая 2015"
"We went to this restaurant multiple times. The food was fresh, amazing tasting and the food hygiene was good. The service was good and the price was reasonable and they also have a sitting toilet which is important if that's what you're used to!

"The restaurant is` adjacent to the Novotel Peace Hotel, where we stayed and was easy to chose by convenience. It turned out to be an excellent choice by itself, because the food was excellent. We @dedicated the evening to the duck. So we had a duck soup, followed by a Beijing Duck. The Duck was very tasty, eaten rolled into...

"This was a recommendation made by a TA reviewer of the hotel I was staying at, Park Plaza Wangfujing. We ate here twice. Everything we ordered was terrific. The only slight disappointment was the Peking Duck. It was more like Cantonese Duck with pancakes. It still tasted good though. Their tofu, scallion pancakes, fresh fish (pick one and they will...

"...by our tour guide. It is just to the left of Novotel Peace hotel. Very friendly and sufficient English to get by. We ate there twice and food very good, especially liked the spinach with garlic -but then, we like garlic!

"Although the building is not appealing or the decor is the food is terrific! The order of dumplings is huge, and the Lo mein was great. They do not speak great English so just be prepared. At first, it seemed they didn't have bottle water, but when you get up to look they do. It is also very cheap.","4 из 5 кружков","A7E61ECF6F56BF173B02183DB3B37B0C","Отзыв написан 31 июля 2013"

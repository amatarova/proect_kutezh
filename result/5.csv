"there are a lot of yunnan places in beijing, but this is one of my favorite, do not expect luxury ambient ..it is really cool and local, the food super spicy and amazing.. the only bad point is the location, far away from the bar area and it's difficult to find taxi...as always if you are a foreigner","4 из 5 кружков","A92B0029E23E8AFAA89F75E533AF88E9","14 марта 2017"
"From a bonafide meat-eater...Ignore any western sensibilities, and typical meat 'trimming'...enjoy the most delicious 'melt in the mouth' and tasty fat (where applicable...I'm sure there are plenty of vegetarian options as well), along with gorgeous flavours. I can only add to all the positive comments about this restaurant. I'm glad we made the effort to find this place...the tastiest food we had during our stay in Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","17BCF74009C154AFC3869207110F9962","10 марта 2017"
"Little yunnan is tucked away amidst the hustle and bustle of Beijing - we arrived on a cold , snowy afternoon to a warm welcome and excellent food and atmosphere ! Ask for across the bridge noodles - it's not on the menu. We sampled many dishes and loved this big bowl of broth along with fried goats cheese and delicious mushrooms ! Well worth a visit !","5 из 5 кружков","FB586AC1F3C113DFA4A559875E8369EB","15 февраля 2017"
"We have just had a fabulous meal. All the dishes cooked beautifully, very flavoursome and the meat tender. A very cosy place, with locals and westerners.
A winner for anyone visiting Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","4D7B762E370C57CE4B809E4AE8010319","Отзыв написан 8 февраля 2017"

"First night in Beijing, after reading reviews before we arrived in Beijing we were set on trying here.
And it did not disappoint.

"We visited Little Yunnan on Christmas the food was amazing. I especially loved the fried mushrooms with cold bamboo shoots. My 3 year old couldn't get enough of the deep fried mushrooms as well. Prices are very reasonable and they even have locally made rice milk wine. This place is a must visit on any trip to Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","358291D59E39AF1DA223FC29E47D854A","Отзыв написан 29 декабря 2016"
"A small courtyard house (about 300 years old) contains Little Yunnan, which in itself is a great experience add to that a warm and welcoming staff - we were looked after by Lewis who's English is excellent- and then comes the oh so tasty food. Not one of the dishes we ordered disappointed. We were especially taken with the pineapple sticky rice and the house made rice wine.
At the end of our meal Lewis called us a cab and saw us safely inside.
It was a wonderful evening and one we will cherish.","5 из 5 кружков","7F2AED967E63BD4438FA62EDC3631F4B","Отзыв написан 16 декабря 2016"
"Went for lunch after the Forbidden City. Nice and easy to find spot. Waitstaff there spoke very little English, but didn't matter as menu is clearly marked with pictures and English. I got spare ribs, hot and sour soup and Lemongrass tea....all with a bit of spice, and delicious. A nice pick up after a morning of wandering around.","4 из 5 кружков","038DEFF299C1A7D40596EA5EC8511AE4","Отзыв написан 26 ноября 2016"
"We went
to this restaurant that was close to our hotel. Good comments on TripAdvisor and recommended by Lonely Planet. Great decor and cosy atmosphere. Service in good English by the manager. We had quite good dishes although we ordered too much for two. The Yunnan dishes are spicy so be prepared for hot food! A good option in this area!","4 из 5 кружков","8FC27743A48EBA3B3A7DD1F80243074D","Отзыв написан 6 ноября 2016"
"The english speaking staff member tried his best to give us a table even tough we didn't made reservations. The atmosphere and interior are laid back and very cosy. We ordered a very good cocktail: little yunnan pink lady. The food was also very delicious. English translations on the menu. Only downside: the toilet is not western..","4 из 5 кружков","E51AC947FE974EA836827F05D52F1223","Отзыв написан 6 ноября 2016"
"We ate lunch here after exploring the Forbidden City. It’s a nice little spot to rest after all that walking. The dishes we ordered were a little on the spicy side. We ordered green beans and a beef dish. We also got the fried spring rolls which were decent but it came with ketchup as a dipping sauce. Good food overall. They also take credit card (Visa).","4 из 5 кружков","83795B7B11F0233596E42001453FC4BD","Отзыв написан 3 ноября 2016"

"My travel style is to wander and explore narrow alleys and places w/o tour leaders with poles and flags. This is how I found this wonderful local restaurant.
Ample menu in English, friendly English speaking staff and great CD's playing. They had my playlist. lol

We had a chicken dish spring rolls and rice with a couple of drinks. The food was very nice and cost less then 10 pounds for everything which is amazing.

"We have been there twice....the ambient of the restaurant is very nice : Chinese with a touch of indie. The food is Chinese cousins with a touch of raffinate western influence. The mint salad is superb as well as the ribs served with spicy powder mixed with webs to dig the rib in. We tried a number of other different plates : all very interesting.

"I have eaten in this place during my visit to Beijing and would recommend you to do the same, however the place gets really crowded and given the huge amount of tourists they get, I'd say the place isn't as authentic as it could be, it does feel a bit touristy.","4 из 5 кружков","D43B67BEA4BCB9C8044526A86AB5999C","Отзыв написан 7 сентября 2016"

"This restaurant is great because you can really taste food coming from Yunnan in a nice atmosphere. The place is pleasant with some interesting pictures from old Beijing. And the food is very good. Don't hesitate to taste many different plates as they are all good, but of course kind of spicy too, be careful!!!!","4 из 5 кружков","BA38E61F6B4B56CEA0AF9DFBD0C9AD31","Отзыв написан 31 августа 2016"
"Cosy place with little roof windows through which the sunlight came in. For two people we ordered chili tofu, jasmine flower egg wok, jasmine flower rice and sweet sticky rice with pineapple, all of which were fresh and super tasty, for a total of 102 yuan (and I felt we ate quite a lot). Good meat-free options!

We were alone in the restaurant at around 15:00. For some reason one of the staff hovered a few feet away taking pictures (I think) of us for like 5-10 min (without saying anything) which made me feel a little uncomfortable, so one star off for that. But I'd still come back for the food :)","4 из 5 кружков","37C87F194DFF47E8E8E0784AA9CE4D84","Отзыв написан 25 августа 2016"

"We followed a recommendation for this place and it didn't disappoint. It was easy to find with a clear English sign. The menu also has everything in English and the staff were very helpful.

They had lots of dishes, we went for one each and some rice. The portions were so big though we could have shared.

Two mains, rice, 2 cokes a beer and a cocktail came to: 154CNY (<U+00A3>17)

"One of the best place ever! Yunnan cuisine is a mix between classic Chinese and tropical cuisine: you can eat different and mixed tastes, as beef with mint, rice cooked in ananas, pressed rice in banana leaves, pomegranate leaves salads, fried sheep cheese...and rice wine!
The location is cosy, decorated with flowers and they are really kind - even the menu is also in english!

It's near the northern gate of the Forbidden City, you have to try this restaurant, it was my best experience in Beijing, I can still feel the taste now.","5 из 5 кружков","184289F6B435689BD7177DFD1B522441","Отзыв написан 17 августа 2016"
"We have had dinner at this place. The food is excellent and we have had dinner already at several other places in Beijing. The staff speaks English and is very friendly and helpfull. After dinner, they took time to help us with locations of e.g. massage salons, calling them etc.

Definitily go to this place for delicious food.","5 из 5 кружков","8C104705D9C1F9F61C36DB09FDFA5B19","Отзыв написан 14 августа 2016"
"We entered the restaurant in the late afternoon and were welcome by some unmotivated service personnel. We were very unsure if this place is worth to stay, but decided ""give it a try"" and ordered the meal.
After getting the different orders, the situation changed completely: Amazing taste, every meal had its own special experience. An outstanding performance of the cook!

Normally 5 stars, but minus 1 for the service.","4 из 5 кружков","3B9697A930872BAC40686A59179E1D88","Отзыв написан 10 августа 2016"

"The food was good, we especially liked the salad made with mint leaves. Some dishes such as tofu in banana leaves were more undistinguished. Services was quick and helpful and the servants spoke understandable english. Upon leaving, the servant asked us for a good review at TripAdvisor, which really put me off.

"I would highly recommend Little Yunnan to everyone - brilliant food in a lovely setting and some of the most wonderful service you can imagine! After an adventurous trip to our hotel (our driver dropped us off at the wrong place with ALL our luggage) our large group was looking for what become known as 'linner' (late lunch/early dinner) and not only did Little Yunnan look after our weary heads and hungry stomachs but also took in our large group of 9 with ease! The staff, owner and his wife were extremely warm and friendly and all of the food fantastic and plentiful - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","5 из 5 кружков","AA676C3FA35D6AAAF39F610E9E5AFA57","Отзыв написан 2 августа 2016"

"Neat food in local settings/pure Chinese setting. I went there a few days ago with a group of four. We where the only Europeans when we arrived and got a few friendly laughs for our lag of knowledge of customs

The food is transnational Chinese from what I gather. It was all good and authentic + tasty, spicy but not too spicy. This is a must if you want to go to a place where more ""Chinese"" turist come

The staff is friendly but are poor at english. We barely got a reservation through but manged to in English. You might want to get your hotel to make a reservation for you as the place is popular","4 из 5 кружков","3F63147941C2C47C6572E4B9E1E16F87","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2016"
"Went to check out the rave reviews of little yunnan and honestly it didn't disappoint. I would say the mint beef salad is one of the most amazing combination of flavors in a dish I've almost nearly tasted. Go just to try this dish alone. The wait staff is nice and decor homey. But really - try the mint beef salad. You won't be disappointed in the sauce and combination of mint and beef.","4 из 5 кружков","E0F759356F7EA3C6FE1E5A97A52DCCAF","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2016"

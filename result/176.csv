"This restaurant is less than a year old, huge and very nicely designed although as a faux traditional structure. The service and food is beautiful and cannot be faulted. It is on the edge of the 798 Art district. Very chic clientele and a really nice vibe.","5 из 5 кружков","E2355924E88FD2C86BE598F88E6E8DDE","Отзыв написан 29 ноября 2016"
"We are visiting from the US and had lunch at Najia with colleagues in a private room that seats eight. It's a great place to dine with a group, and has lovely decor. We sampled everything from asparagus, mushrooms, dandelion salad, fresh tofu, fish, lamb, and duck - all delicious, and satisfied both local and western tastes. As far as...

"I enjoyed a delicious lunch here while Touring the 798 Art zone. Very popular with a local crowd. There was not much English spoken but the menu had some Interesting subtitles. Who wants ""7 day rotted vegetables?"" With some pointing and smiling I had a great lunch. Stick to the known items and all will be good. Caution, tell them...

"Dinner with the family. We had bean curd, eggplant and aspic for starters. Followed by venison bao, fried mushrooms, fried tofu, asparagus with lotus, steak with spicy sauce and jumbo shrimp in some kind of sweet sauce (maybe sweet and sour), fried pancake with onions and pork filled buns. The food came out on yellow ceramic plates which were the...

"Najia Xiaoguan Restaurant (<U+90A3><U+5BB6><U+5C0F><U+9986>) is a good place for typical Beijing Imperial cuisine. We went to the branch located at 798 Art District after we took a morning stroll around the art district. Since they didn't allow us to order just half the Peking Duck, we decided just to order 1 Peking Duck (RMB268) and 2 other vegetable dishes (I...

"I live in BJ, and this is a great restaurant. It has other branches, but I like this one because, despite being by Art 798, it doesn't get many tourists. Lovely atmosphere, great food, and one of the best Peking Duck's in Beijing, at half the price of, say Da Dong (though more expensive than you'd pay at a ""local""...

"We were taken here for dinner by our Chinese hosts. The food was excellent! We shared about 20 dishes amongst about 10 people. The highlight of the meal was the Peking Duck, which was sliced thinly by a chef a supplied with little wrappers and plum sauce. This was a great place to go for a larger group. We had...

"We were invited there by our local friends and we're excited to see the place when we arrived. Got even more excited when we were shown the menu while waiting for a table. Despite the restaurant claiming that there will be no queue, we waited for at least 45min to get a place. As diners eat early in Beijing, by...

"We were brought here by Chinese friends. The signature shrimp could not be tried due to allergies among us. We had a variety of dishes and our local hosts kept away from freshwater fish due to sourcing issues. This is China. The food was good while the service mentality was ""can we break the record to get all this dishes...

"This is a new branch of an elegant restaurant, so it's a great place to impress business customers, local ex-pats and foreign visitors. The building and decorations are classic and superb. The ground floor toilets alone are worth a visit (seriously; take a look). The food is also top-quality. Their Beijing Kao Ya is very good. The honey walnut shrimp...

"This restaurant is huge but almost packed up until 20:30. There are much more locals than foreigners. The decor, furniture and cutlery are refined but not presumptuous as in those restaurants in San Li Tun. The service is also attentive but at the same time, they don't try to do the impossible not existent in their nature, so very at...

"I work nearby and often take my colleagues for lunch and dinner at this place. Make a reservation, this place is very popular with locals and tourists, otherwise you might have to wait for an hour out side. If you wait, the staff will serve tea and snacks. Try the shrimp!","5 из 5 кружков","E0AE7A363348A516B99DE6F696F4C2B1","Отзыв написан 22 сентября 2014"

"The food and Enviroment is great! I love to go to or recommend. If you prefer to go there, try to skip the rush hour, this place is open during the whole day time not only the meal time! It is not a choice for a group tour, can be a good option for 1 to cliens for the space...

"a new restaurant close to 798 area, very well designed, representing an old traditional chinese mansion. The place is quite elegant and relaxing after a whole day throughout the different art galleries. The food is beijing food. The service is perfect. The atmosphere is quite interesting. Not too many tourists but mostly local people.","5 из 5 кружков","769AC8A1F0DD83DC600D2D80F3BE4B55","Отзыв написан 17 апреля 2013"
"Was taken here on a business trip - great ambience, service and food. Highly recommended, although I'm struggling to recommend any dishes as the food was ordered for me. We certainly ate the large prawns that one visitor has shown on the photos - and they were absolutely stunning!

"We ate like emperors from the chefs who used to prepare the royal family's meals. The food was so amazing. We ate for about $40 for 2 with soda for each of us. We had 6 dishes. Nothing was bland. Nothing was simple. Everything had a variety of flavors. The restaurant itself is very romantic. It was a little challenging...

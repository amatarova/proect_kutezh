"The Burger Master in this restaurant takes great pride in his work. I have lived in Beijing for 21 years and live not far from Katchup. The Blue Cheese burger with the thinly sliced fried onion rings is to die for and the potato wedges are filling and cooked just right. If you are craving a really good burger, this...

"After 25 days travelling in China, I craved a burger and I'm so happy my friend took me here, a great, meaty, juicy burger with lots of flavour and big enough to share! good home-made fries too. Not super cheap but well worth it, and the location is great for going out.","5 из 5 кружков","F6AB14CD7D65CCB0A1517CC5282A1C4A","Отзыв написан 1 сентября 2016"
"For me one of the best burgers in Beijing. Much better than Great Leap burgers. I tried the BBQ burger with potato fries and homemade lemonade. Excellent! The service is incredible friendly and focused on each detail when preparing a table.","5 из 5 кружков","04881B67078493B30AE7CE7FDB7872EB","Отзыв написан 4 июля 2016"
"Maybe good value for money. Often empty. But you won't leave hungry. Fries good. Good meats, can build a burger how you want it. I hope they branch out more.","4 из 5 кружков","9E533452020933E1A347927A4460CB32","Отзыв написан 30 июня 2016"

"People talk a big game about Great Leap's burgers, but I find Katchup's superior. They sport a great array of options, ranging from classic to straight-up decadent, and make some awesome, albeit unconventional, fries. Friendly staff and good beer selection to boot. If you're looking for something over-the-top, go with the Atomic, a slab of meat that comes slathered in...

"This is one of my favorite burger places in Beijing. The meal deal they have is especially good with any burger, salad or soup and soft drink for 88rmb. I have tried most of the burgers here but my favorite is still probably the Atomic burger. It's essentially a Mexican style burger. The fries here aren't to everyone's taste. They...

"We ordered burgers to be delivered while we were having a couple of beers at a nearby pub. I ordered the Big Bleu and it was delicious. There was a nice amount of blue cheese on the burger, the bacon was nice and crispy, and there was a proper patty. I would definitely order this again.","5 из 5 кружков","C0E1DC6E505604F8DCCB01CADE036172","Отзыв написан 15 декабря 2015"
"It's a pleasure to find a decent hamburger in Beijing. There are a few, and this is definitely one of them. I also liked that I could get a Qing Dao in a small bottle since I wanted room for my burger (I have a small stomach!). The fries it came with were huge, the biggest I've seen, and tasty....

"Burgers here are very good and made fresh to order. A small place so it doesn't feel like a fast food crowded place. Great chips too.","4 из 5 кружков","D58A9FDD19526B75267D8DB80C84306A","Отзыв написан 3 октября 2015"
"The burgers were excellent and delicious! Highly recommend. Fries were not so great, they were large and not as good as I hoped!","4 из 5 кружков","E47A10AAA7EE52C02CC2DD140452D912","Отзыв написан 11 апреля 2015"
"Walking hungry from sightseeing we found this little small place on the main street and we were absolutely happy with everything at Katchup. Friendly and english-speaking staff, fantastic burgers and home-made potato chips, very good selections of drinks and beer.","5 из 5 кружков","D6A32A04A2884D23A9028FD11664D596","Отзыв написан 6 апреля 2015"
"This hidden burger place is definitely worth a visit. The burgers are huge and delicious and the fries are excellent as well. Everything is cooked fresh before your eyes. My absolute favourite dish, however, was the roasted potatoe soup with bacon! AMAZING :)","5 из 5 кружков","8EAA92E7E821CC1104BB8AAE19E26079","Отзыв написан 28 января 2015"
"We've been here a few times and have not been disappointed yet. The staff are friendly, the place is bright and clean, service is very quick and the burgers are huge and really tasty. Personal favourites are the Reuben and the Big Bleu (with blue cheese). We will keep coming back and highly recommend Katchup!","4 из 5 кружков","197D0BB50E48594851B92BC72115E6BE","Отзыв написан 4 декабря 2014"
"Recommended by a friend as there are few ""good"" burger places in that particular area. Not far (5 minute walk) from Nanluoguxiang. Reminded me of a small place back home in the US. Good burgers with cut potatoes in a clean nice place. Beef perhaps could have been a better quality, and service is what you would expect from a...

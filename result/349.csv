"As is often the case in China, what can you say for service? It's just friendly. This place is an unassuming and very popular -- in both senses-- hangout for locals. It's open around the clock and food is so nice and cheap to boot. Very much worth giving a try.","4 из 5 кружков","58076C21D042706D9AB93037ABAD5DB2","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2014"

"I love pulled pork, and Home Plate's pulled pork offering was dynamite. The restaurant has a great selection of classic American southern cooking, and the staff are really friendly. The restaurant has a nice, laid-back vibe. I look forward to returning.","4 из 5 кружков","6729FC2C460E57C49258E4E3F0641B35","12 марта 2017"
"My friends and colleagues had raved about this place. However, I had also listened to them rave about Mexican food restaurants so their previous recommendations had been so disappointing. My wife and I tried Home Plate anyways and I was thoroughly satisfied with the quality of the food and the portion sizes. I had the pulled pork and my wife...

"Who could know you would get such great America BBQ in Beijing? The brisket is to die for, the grits like homemade, the ribs falling apart and the beverage just the way you like it! What not to like?","4 из 5 кружков","007492FD28B65DFAED4B6DA2B5CA75E0","Отзыв написан 10 января 2017"
"As a Memphis native and current Texas resident, my BBQ bar is set pretty high. Home Plate did not disappoint. We had the 4 meat platter to share, so we could try all the major offerings and I must say it was all pretty good! I liked the pulled pork and sausage the best. My fiancee liked the rib tips...

"I had lunch here 3 times over the course of a month, as it was close to where I worked. The BBQ was pretty good, as were the french fries. A little pricey for Beijing, but about standard for good quality Western Food. Very hard to find; I read about it on Time Out, but would never have happened upon...

"Home plate offers up great American BBQ (you'll ask which kind--go to find out!), at a pretty competitive cost. Their Xiaoyun Lu location has outdoor picnic table seating, as well as indoor table seating plus a small high top/stool strip along the window. The lunch sets offer the best value--sandwich or entree of choice, plus a side and a beverage...

"Home Plate was recommended to me by a friend living in Beijing and he was spot on. Great food, a very nice ambiance and good service. If you are looking for a break from Chinese food, this is a great choice. I was there on a Friday night and the place was very busy and when I left was completely...

"Delicious, felt very American. Boyfriend had a bbq chicken sandwhich and I had a veggie burger. Good beers for 20quay. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I don't get why the waitresses don't speak English? This restaurant is specifically aiming to attract western ex pats, but the staff don't speak any English. Very frustrating.","4 из 5 кружков","B0C338E30A8FAE7C616CCFA9C948C96A","Отзыв написан 11 апреля 2016"
"In the land of all you can eat, any style Chinese food, this place does an excellent job of an American touch of BBQ. When you want a good sandwich, ribs, or fries, or something a little more ""Western"", this place does the trick. They have a nice selection of beers to go along with the food. They have a...

"I frequented this restaurant a ton when I lived in Beijing. It's home style cooking will transport you out of Beijing in the deep south. The pulled pork was my favourite, but the friend pickles always went down as a big hit. The alley way location was one of my favourite spots in the city to sit around the street...

"One of our Beijing favorites, Home Plate fills the need for Texas BBQ. We love everything we've had including brisket, pulled pork, burgers, fried pickles, corn dogs, and nachos. Wish there were a few totally not-spicy sauces, but still all around great grub. Brush up on your Chinese, as the few English-speaking employees that used to be there seem to...

"I found the restaurant through Trip Advisor and it's close to the hotel I was staying.

"This original location is a bit hard to find if your new to Beijing but worth seeking out. They also opened up a much larger venue in Sanlitun which is definitely worth a visit where they also occasionally host live bands and comedians.

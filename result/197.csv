"Have visited this restaurant many times over the last 6 years and always a pleasure. In this last visit for my daughter’s birthday we ordered the usual favourites of BBQ Combo and Southwest Chicken Salad with beers and wine. All were fantastic as was the free fresh bread and butter. The best part has to be the service and the...

"Union bar is a very nice and cozy place with a friendly atmosphere. It's a good replacement for a real American dinner if you are fet up with chinese food. If you just want a beer and a chat I recommend you to sit at the bar, there is always somebody to talk to or you can just enjoy the...

The staff speak english and they have special brunch meals on weekends as well as 2 or 3 course lunch specials on week days.

"Its really hard to find good western restaurants in beijing. This restaurant was really good. Me and my husband ate where twice and would come there again if it was close to our hotel. The prices are expensive for china but are quite the same to the prices we pay in Israel. At lunch time there is a business meal...

"Normally a really good dining experience, but today poor. We were seated in the non smoking section, but only about 10 feet away from a smoker in the smoking section. No sauces were brought out with the starter so we asked for some and the waiter asked my girlfriend if she liked sauces because she was pregnant (she is not....

"Passing through Beijing on our way to Chengdu. Friends recommended this place so off to lunch we went. My Ruben sandwich was pretty good, and my wife had the pastrami Ruben. Again, good sandwich. The fries were just ok. Nice atmosphere and I'm sure this place is packed most nights and weekends given its location.","3 из 5 кружков","1862831D15975B6BDC9639C696F3E357","Отзыв написан 30 декабря 2014"
"Dinner here Christmas eve. Located in an upscale mall an open late. Mall was very busy so gave this a shot. This is just like Chili's or Friday's type food. If you dont like smoking indoors then avoid the bar area. Bartender is very good at what she does. One of the best. Foodwise was pretty decent. Had the nachos,...

"If you are a Western visitor and fancy a good steak and chips then the Union Grill will satisfy you. However, if you live in Beijing and like to get value for your money as well as good food then steer well clear. I dined at the Union Grill and was taken by the pleasant decor and the presence of...

"Now ... what were you thinking? I am talking about the ribs. While the portion size is great, and the dry to wet ratio was good ... they were unfortunately not drop of the bone tender. However everything else from the cheese steak sandwich, nachos, service and atmosphere were good. Definitely a place we will return to, especially since HH...

"This place is next to a lot of decent restaurants so has much competition. Staff are ok but a bit clumsy around the tables and awkward at times with foreign customers. The buffalo chicken wings are very good and the food on the whole was to a decent standard. Portions are big especially the deserts. I do get annoyed with...

"We came here the once to try it, and my eyes were far too bog for my stomach, I ordered a lot. The scalloped potatoes (gratin) were gorgeous but so filling, and I had ordered this as a side to my main, as well as a half portion of the steak pasta as a starter, which to be honest was...

"Great ribs and other US style food. drinks list is long but pricey on wine. A more upmarket bar/diner where families are welcome and is suitable for a casual business dinner too. Staff good and not pushy. Good location on 3rd floor of the Village, Sanlitun. Family friendly with paper tablecloths and crayons given to kids to draw on them.","4 из 5 кружков","129BF6CC6B4A153318A881C79BFC64C4","Отзыв написан 19 октября 2013"
"After an overload of Chinese food, we decided we wanted a western meal and we just happened to be passing The Union. We were seated and served drinks quickly. The atmosphere inside was reasonable but a bit quiet for a Sunday night. It was probably a good thing they had TVs on and music playing, otherwise it would have been...

"I go to this place almost every other week on either Saturday or Sunday, just for their chicken wing. I would say they have the best buffalo chicken wing in Beijing.

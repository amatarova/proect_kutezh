"Tremendous food and extremely good value for money. I highly recommend pre-ordering the Peking duck. It is simply amazing. But the rest of the food is extraordinary too.

"This is one of the more elegant restaurants in Parkview Green. The decor, and clientele are equally fancy, making this one of the few places in Beijing that are more elegant.

"My friend told me it is a really prestigious restaurant; however, I was disappointed by the food. It definitely has a really good and convenient location, especially if you work at the Oriental Plaza or stay at the Grand Hyatt. Service is on average, too. We ordered their signature dishes, but we didn't like it either. The only dish I...

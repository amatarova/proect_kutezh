"Nice veggie restaurant located close to Lama Temple. Pleasant atmosphere, ok staff and very good choice of 'western' food. From falafel and humus via Eastern-European style lentil soup to Indian curry - loads to choose from. They also have rather large drinks menu (coffee, smoothies, cocktails and wines). What I found rather peculiar though was, that they serve traditional Czech...

"We liked this place a lot. Both had burgers, which came on excellent bread , and the mezzo selection was really good too. It's quite easy to find, in a great part of the city for eating and drinking. It had a laid-back feel.

"of the three vegetarian restaurants i visited in beijing, this was the least interesting and most annoying. the laidback inattentive service with bland hippie era food is what gave vegetarian restaurants a reputation of ""alternative."" dope infused hippies are common in beijing but disaffected youth flourish and give their scant attention to customers here. the menu's pasta heavy main courses...

"The southwest bean burger and the falafel were delicious! The sweet potato fries did not disappoint either, but I would have to say my favorite part of the meal as the house made ketchup and the vegan mayo! It wasn't too crowded when we went so we were able to sit immediately. Overall, everything was very nice.","4 из 5 кружков","84F5FE7CBCEEAAA73A808D4D0DD756B5","Отзыв написан 29 августа 2016"
"What an incredible place. If you're reading this, you may have already realised that being vegan is not easy in China, particularly if, like me, you will not eat at places which have meat on the premises, for a variety of reasons. To find somewhere that publishes so openly and clearly that they have no animal products or bi-products on...

"My son took me here on my first day in Beijing because it was close to his flat, and because he is vegetarian. This is a great place for anyone who doesn't speak Mandarin as the restaurant is in English and the waiters speak some English too. Places with only Mandarin on the menu are challenging, to say the least.So...

"The area around the Lama temple and Dongzhimen has some excellent vegetarian restaurants. The veggie table is the only one serving western food. Located in the wudaoying hutong this beautiful place was a pleasant suprise. The couscous was full of warm flavours and very very nice, as was the wine. Chinese food is awesome, but I was very pleased to...

"This is a lovely place, nice atmosphere, chilled music, pretty decoration. I took a Chinese friend to experience some western food, and what followed was a tremendous loss of face: The starters we ordered were ok (the hummus actually pretty good), but the spaghetti were bland and overcooked to the point of being disgusting. I've never had such soggy, unappealing...

"The Veggie table has a lovely ambience, located on a lively and very interesting Hutong near the Lama Temple (Buddhist) and also near the large Confucian Temple not far from the center of Beijing.

"We tried vegan food before in many countries (fusion or entirely local vegan), but this one really won the price for the most ""non-edible but beautifully made food"".

"The only reason I didn't give The Veggie Table an ""excellent"" rating is because of their inattentive staff. The food, however, is delicious! You can taste the high quality ingredients that they use. It was wonderful to find a vegan restaurant in Beijing. The price was reasonable considering the ingredients and their focus on sustainablity. I would definitely go back...

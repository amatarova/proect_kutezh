"The food is great and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The Chinese Assistant Manager or Supervisor is excellent and always very welcoming. In the summer there is a great roof top terrace and music. The only let down is the engagement and interaction from the General Manager (Spanish).

"Brought my wife here to dinner impress her. Mission failed. Food is certainly adequate, but over-priced.

"There are not many restaurants serving European food in Beijing that are consistently good without being exorbitantly expensive. But Migas fits the bill.

"Migas is quite a nice Spanish food Restaurant, although not the best in Nali Patio ( a must in Sun Li Tun Area). Nevertheless the rooftop is unbeatable. Good music and a fantastic atmosphere every evening and night all week long. Take a quick selection of Spanish Tapas and go up to enjoy dancing and drinking.","4 из 5 кружков","AE53440F0D68C2C72BE459A8FCB24E81","Отзыв написан 9 июля 2016"

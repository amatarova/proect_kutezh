"The schoolhouse is a tucked in place near Mutianyu part of the wall. Our menu was preset and arranged by a tour guide. Don't expect a traditional Chinese cuisine, but if you are up for a good sandwich after a hike, this place is highly recommended.","4 из 5 кружков","2744CA832D4E6D7B9963700C960DD8FF","Отзыв написан 28 ноября 2016"
"If you are lucky enough to enjoy a day at the Great Wall with good weather and clear skies, you really cannot do better than topping it off with an al fresco lunch at The Schoolhouse. Nice variety of Asian and western dishes; fresh salads; refreshing drinks; lovely courtyard.","4 из 5 кружков","A4CFCFB5BB44F92A025B948BE0959543","Отзыв написан 25 сентября 2016"
"We visited for lunch on a visit to the Great Wall. Our tour guide brought us here for lunch....what an unexpected surprise . The food is all locally sourced, and they have a huge garden of herbs and vegetables onsite. This is an oasis for relaxing and just chilling out. After a wonderful lunch, the owner took us on a...

"We visited The Schoolhouse as part of a group trip after our walk on the Great Wall, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I always rate a restaurant by whether or not I would buy their shirt if they had one, and I would have bought the polo shirt if they could have found it quickly before we needed to leave.","4 из 5 кружков","85E44519C0833B5B2247597AFF24CAD4","Отзыв написан 12 августа 2016"
"I only have amazing things to say at this place. I only regret for not staying longer. I booked it for only one night and went back to Beijing the next day after hiking at the Mutianyu section.

"The schoolhouse is a very cute little spot to stop at, but I've been disappointed several times. Despite the fact that we plan visiting ahead of time (you have to, if you are purchasing a vehicle pass through them to go to Mutianyu...at least the day before), the staff on every occasion seemed to just be arriving, and we waited...

"The Schoolhouse at Brickyard at the Great Wall is located a short drive from the Mutianyu entrance. All the old farmhouse buildings are restored and there is a small restaurant overlooking the garden.

"For the high price we paid (for set lunches only), we get an extremely mediocre meal that, perhaps, is only worthy of the school house cafeteria name.

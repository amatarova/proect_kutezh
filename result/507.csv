"When this restaurant was situated in its original location the food was great and service also. After they have moved to the new place, the food is still good, but the service is far away from what it was. They take a long time do to anything, even to bring you the menu and beer...last time we went the lady...

"I travel to Beijing several times a year and I always head to Tim's Texas Bar-B-Q for some good food, relaxing environment and to enjoy the Texas themed decor. And during football season they have NFL highlights on their big screen TV so I get to catch up on all the games. My Beijing co-workers want to take me for...

"Visited last year and absolutely loved it. They have moved locations and the new location only offers a small area for indoor seating. We sat outside, they had ample umbrellas so this helped with the heat. The food was ok at best. All of it seemed to have a funny aftertaste, didn't taste like authentic Texas BBQ.","3 из 5 кружков","3C5A0D619144F0B0D7ADDED57E0551CC","Отзыв написан 14 июля 2016"
"After Tim's original place was shut down due to the landlord not renewing the lease he managed to open up a small place in Central Park and now he has a bigger and better place in Wang Jing! Yes there have been some consistency issues through all this turmoil but I am impressed at the return to the high quality...

"My wife and I decide to try this place out since I am from Texas and love Texas BBQ. We are living in China for 4 months and were excited to find a BBQ place. We ordered the nachos which were not ""macho"" at all in size or amount of ingredients. The salsa was very bland and the sour cream...

"This place was great, though hard to find. The BBQ ribs were very good, especially for BBQ in China! Nicely smoked and flavorful. Their sauce was outstanding...slightly spicy and not too sweet. The potato salad was similarly REALLY good. More flavorful than the typical mayo/mustard potato salad. Nicely spiced, great consistency (has some celery and onion crunch, potatoes cooked to...

"Yum cha was a bit of a Sunday morning institution back in Australia. And despite it being a southern cuisine I have found some nice dumpling restaurants here in Beijing. To this list I can now add Jing Yaa Tang. Perhaps a little less traditional than some but absolutely delicious, with some truly sophisticated modern takes on traditional Chinese dishes...

"The food here is a modernized take on Chinese cuisine, done with better presentation. The peking duck was done well, with firewood oven, and the chefs were kind enough to show us how they did it through their glass windowed kitchen. Their dishes like the dumplings and vinegar ribs were also very good. Really recommend this place for the food...

"I was extremely impressed to once again visit Jing Yaa Tang. The service quality is fantastic - friendly, attentive and polite staff.

"Duck is a must have. This is one of the best duck in beijing, also the smallest. One order can feed two adults at most. The duck skin melts on your tongue. Yummy. Dishes run small in general.","5 из 5 кружков","865EFF62849982028B297DCC5B48D508","Отзыв написан 4 февраля 2017"
"I have eaten in many great restaurants and I can happily include this one in my list. Duck was the highlight of the meal. Best to order in advance when you make your reservation.

"Went here expressly for Jing Yaa Tang's Peking Duck and the duck, accompaniments, and service was excellent. Our hotel called to make a reservation and to ensure they served Peking Duck at lunchtime. Our server spoke fairly good English, which greatly helped our enjoyment of what we believe to be perfectly prepared Peking Duck. She carefully explained how to assemble...

"Went on suggestion of a friend, nice, quiet, affordable and reasonable quality. If you're a lamb person then you'll feel well catered for. We had rose tea, stir fried veggies, lamb pasties, noodle and garlic chicken. All were fine and at $5 a head very reasonable. Will be coming back to try the pomegranate wine. Menus have pictures and English...

"Although a little hard to find from the ""main"" strip, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Beijing. The garlic naan is addictive and pairs perfectly with the lamb skewers. The staff don't speak English, but they were very attentive.","5 из 5 кружков","7E0379F0E85EED7B5BD0CA5D25C0D0B7","Отзыв написан 18 декабря 2016"
"The yogurt was good, would recommend. The naan is not naan, or good for that matter. The lamb skewer was literally fat on a stick. The vegetable salad turned out to be a fruit salad..... like one reviewer said we asked the waitress and she insisted it was the same thing as on the menu... no it was not. The...

"If you like unfriendly service and fatty strange meals this place is for you! We arrived at the restaurant and we were the only customers. After looking at the strange meal photos the waitress pushed us for ordering 5 plates saying it was really small plates. As we already ordered too much in other restaurants we insisted to cancel one...

"Fantastic food and no shortcuts on the spices. Whole garlic cloves, star anise, big chunks of ginger. Two of us started with 2 kebabs and two main dishes. Half way through we were so full. The flavours and quality kept us going as long as we could. The whole meal was less than 200 CNY. Clean restaurant, good service and...

"The name of this restaurant in English is actually 'Crescent Moon' if you're searching for it elsewhere. The Chinese name is <U+5F2F><U+5F2F><U+7684><U+6708><U+4EAE> and the TripAdvisor listing has mixed up English, Pinyin and Chinese. I really like the building itself. It would be hard to make the interior and decorations less Chinese and more Xinjiang. The decorations, the music, the people...

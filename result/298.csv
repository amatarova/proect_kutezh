"The food is good, the service is friendly. For a nice reasonably priced dinner I recommend this restaurant. I was with friends and the waiter suggested we order more food for our table. We were so glad we listened to his suggestion.","5 из 5 кружков","DD097EB30A9D5F2E200F17917AC7FBE4","ќтзыв написан 19 июн€ 2016"

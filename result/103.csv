"A really wonderful place, great for tourists and natives, and I will absolutely come visit again when I come back to China in the summer (I visit every year for relatives). Lovely decor and great sort of hip vibe, also, a proper toilet! All the staff were very friendly and could speak English fluently since they were expats mainly, and...

"Great prices and very reasonable! The food was good! Had the hummus flat bread! They have a western toilet with a disco ball!!! Which is HUGE for this hutong area.

"Came here by chance, attracted by the look and vibe of the place. Great drinks (Pimm's, Mojito..), amazing fries with feta - not to mention the surprisingly great pizza - our first in two weeks of China. We weren't seeking western food but when it is of this quality, in such a friendly place, with such good vibes, why pass?...

"We ordered a winter salad and the Parma ham pizza, both of which were really delicious and some of the best western food we've had during our 4 months traveling in Asia. Location was good (on a quiet hutong), staff was friendly, prices were reasonable. We'll probably dine here again before leaving Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","760CC5D0BD7D0E24B9C4706D4F16C80B","Отзыв написан 17 августа 2016"

"My friend and i had a short stay on a hotel in the same Hutong, and the staff advised us to go to Ramos if we had a pizza craving. This was a very good decision and we ended up going here a few times. The pizza was delicious, fresh, good quality and the waiting time was usually not even...

"Used to live a stone throw from Fangjia Hutong, where Ramo is located, but now unfortunately live much further away, so cannot come as much as I like to. However each time I been there, its been nothing but great. Ambience is always very nice, and drinks and foods are both tasty and affordable. It can get very busy however,...

"Had a pizza and a salad and both were great. The place like most cool places in Beijing is hiding in a very old and dirty ally, but inside you find a modern restaurant with a mix of diner and coffe shop like decor. Ramo's salad and pizza was a great change after a few weeks of chinese food","5 из 5 кружков","510E979AE0FBAD0511542A0119F60042","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2015"

"We ending up eating here 4-5 times during our stay in Beijing, since we stayed at a hotel nearby. The pizza was really great. Just one negative thing; the first time we ate there, one of the staff was standing in the doorway into the kitchen cutting her fingernails. Sooo disgusting. But at least there weren't any nail clippings on...

"Our offices is in this Hu Tong and we stop by pretty much 2 to 3 times a week, lunch dinners, drinks. We come so often that we actually noticed all the menu changes, and things have only gotten better. Cool to see that this place is doing better, all word of mouth business, and now the place is getting...

"This is a pretty decent pizza place on Fangjia hutong, the venue itself is nice, chic and airy. The food is good and very reasonably priced and the drinks are on the lower end of the price scale as well. Probably the best option in this neck of the woods for a cheaper Western meal.","4 из 5 кружков","6B4AC37E9A29AC212950517E190A9AC6","Отзыв написан 28 апреля 2015"

"The restaurant is nicely decorated with an style which really fits the surrounding area as well as some modern elements. We went there on Sunday late afternoon and still got a seat. There was live music which we really enjoyed. For the food, we had one breakfast set and a pizza. The pizza was really tasty, with a thin crust.","5 из 5 кружков","0362E1AFD334A3C389B916B9BA1BE7DB","Отзыв написан 21 декабря 2014"

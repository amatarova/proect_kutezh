"I went here with a few Chinese friends as we had a few hours break from a meeting not far away. The place is definitely local - you will not find English spoken or written - but the food is wonderful. We shared two hot pots and one skewered lamb dish - all were great albeit one of the hot...

"I dined at this restaurant with a local colleague while on business travel in Beijing (I am from the USA). The place was totally packed at 19:00 on Sunday with what looked like native Beijingers, many in larger groups of 4+ and several families. Waitstaff speaks no English and menus are only in Chinese, but I had the guidance of...

"I went here on a recent trip, accidentally in fact. We walked by this place many times and decided to step in. What a good choice it was. One of our friends said that this is a very famous restaurant, and this place was PACKED. Thankfully we were there towards the end of the lunch so things slowed down just...

"We went there almost 9pm and we were told that only Hot Pot available as the restaurant will be closed at 10pm. We had ordered set for 2 and guess what.. it was bloody pricey as we've been charged CNY366 for that. R ya kidding meh?. Well I'm not a Hot Pot fan but this one is definitely better than...

"The only scenario in which this restaurant (or this type of serving) is a good idea, is if youre with a group of friends having pre-drinks, and youve all already eaten.

"Our student tour (I was one of the parent chaperones) stopped for lunch at Dong Lai Shun after visiting the Forbidden City. We were in a large, upstairs room. The food was authentic, fresh, and very tasty. We did not eat hot pot, but rather several dishes of roasted meats and vegetables. It was a great meal.","5 из 5 кружков","2764E1EE0020CA2CEE8190D6CD4C6F9A","Отзыв написан 2 мая 2015"
"An authentic Chinese hot pot restaurant. Most of the clients are locals. Food is tasty, and portions are generous. Plus you can always order more and get it quickly and cook it in the hotpot so no real harm in risking ordering too little to get started. and the hot pot experience is fun, especially in winter. Excellent value for...

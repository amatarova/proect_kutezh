"We were staying at the Novotel just down the street, so my fiance and I stopped in at Drunk after dinner one night. We were sitting in the quiet, casual coffee shop-style area downstairs until we heard a band warming up, so we moved upstairs. It's a big bar area upstairs with brewing equipment behind the bar, multiple dining areas,...

"Found this bar when returning to our hotel one evening and thought we would give it a shot. We liked the 80s music they had on downstairs. The staff were friendly and helpful. Large variety of western style food available. We had a pizza which we were impressed with. Cocktails were nice also. Has a great vibe. Only reason why...

"The restaurant looks like an average coffee shop when you first walk in but be sure to go upstairs for the good food and the good beer. We enjoyed our meal and the service was excellent. great vibe. We were surprised to hear some 70's & 80's music from the live duo. For craft beer connoisseurs, try the 5x tester...

"Good place to find western food when you're craving it in Beijing. Pizza was decent, and there's a good selection of beer. It was nice to see Franziskaner Wei<U+00DF>bier available. Ordering on the iPad is a bit weird with a group, as only one person can be looking at the menu at a time. We took some slices of cake...

"Definitely caters to the Western crowd but a lot of locals there too. Great location downtown. Live music on the second floor. Lots of western dishes. All food was served quickly and warm. Crafted beers are great but pricey. If you are looking for filling meal would definitely recommend it.","4 из 5 кружков","4645EF744B20EE9668988B2386351476","Отзыв написан 17 декабря 2016"
"Good coffee, even if the price is above reasonable (4 eu for a double expresso). If you want a fast lunch, this is the place, as the dishes are cheap and good quality, and have that western taste that most bars and restaurants in Beijing strugle with. You also get a complimentary tomato and egg soup with each meal choice....

"We were staying at a nearby hotel and fellow guests said try the Drunk. We had dinner there one night but were slightly disappointed with our pizzas, the bases were a tadge underdone and the toppings a bit tasteless. Great atmosphere though with live music.

"We stayed nearby at the Red Wall Garden Hotel. The Drunk is located very nearby the metro stop which is wonderful for all those in that area. They give a 10% discount if you show local hotel room key...can save you a few $$...so take advantage if you can. Pub style decor, with a very young wait staff...located on 3...

"This is the type of place western people crave after being in a Chinese place for quite some time and need a good food fix and good craft beers in the usual familiar environment. So though it might not be what you should be doing in Beijing, it is a great place to visit. Prices are of course higher than...

We were here for dinner, had a beer, excellent French fries, excellent German sausage and tasty salami pizza. Excellent mango ice-cream, disappointing ice-cream with rum and raisins.

"Had our lunch here, it's good! We ordered spaghetti and salad. They have some very good cakes as well. The name seems a bit misleading, you'll think it's a bar restaurant, it's not, perhaps at night. But it has good ambiance as it's in the corner of the street, you can just sit there and sip coffee while people watching...

"Drunk does a roaring trade in serving western food to western people who are tired of the hotel fare served up in the large number of luxury hotels hereabouts. Drunk feels fresh and welcoming, and offers a beery reprieve from the more familiar Tsingtao and Yanjing. They've come up with a neat solution to the language problem by letting you...

Located at a busy intersection the ambience isn't exactly soothing but the home brewed IPAs, particularly the Session Ale exceeded expectations. A good Margherita pizza rounded off the visit.

Struggled to find anything western apart from pizza hut and of course Mc Donalds but with two british teens in tow not keen on the chinese restaurants this place was ideal. Great service, food and nice wine and some craft beers. Steaks were expensive but pasta and chicken reasonable....

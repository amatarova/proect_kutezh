"Friend introduced and brought me here. I had no idea what it was or what we were in for. What an amazing surprise! The food was superb. The elegant presentation was matched by the intense flavors. I highly recommend. It is not the cheapest meal out there, but it is worth every cent. Best meal I have had in a...

"This restaurant is part of a small chain, they also have a burger and a pasta restaurant, the ambiance is great, the food is excellent, very delicious! Usually seats available but to be sure better reserve. If you love seafood this is the place to go to! Arie","5 из 5 кружков","9128466217556EE05A50F6C94A273F2B","Отзыв написан 14 сентября 2016"
"The seafood is very good, the other food is OK but not great. The pricing is a little on the high side for what you get but overall it's a pleasant dining experience.","4 из 5 кружков","49FDD47E68EB82123E1A8F1B3E5AF0C6","Отзыв написан 26 июня 2016"
"Nice portions, nice ingredients, very good flavor in an innovative mixture... Let's Seafood also offers the same concept as its cousins but its not so popular. We wonder why...? Recommended for couples in a mood for romantic dinner, and for your casual business meals. Also, expect to pay around 200 RMB/person plus drinks.","4 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 20 марта 2016"
"Have lived in Beijing for the last couple years. Let's Seafood, when located in Nali Patio was ""go to"" place. Good service and portions for the $$$ spent. Now that the place has moved to Taikoo Li North in the village, it has decreased in value. First, the location is in the bottom floor of the mall. The atmosphere is...

"The place is nice and the food is quite good. As an Italian, I cannot say that the pasta was something noticeable, but I can say that, if compared with other places where foreign people try to cook Italian food, this one doesn't reach the goal as well but the flavors are good. So, if you are looking for real...

"I normally love this restaurant. They have fantastic chips! However, the manager displayed extremely unprofessional behaviour. Less than a teaspoon (and that's generous) full of mash potato was served as a side dish. When my friend asked where his mashed potato was (very polite and friendly) the manager flattened it with a fork to make it look larger, then got...

"It has been years since we were last in here but I am so glad we revisited. The food was excellent,brilliant fish and chips and super sizzling prawns. Service was also very good. It's a nice space with one flaw. No bathroom. There is one in the mall but you DO have to go outside to reach it. Is that...

"We had two different mussels dishes and both were gorgeous. Fries a bit too fat but still good. The cheese cake was wow!!!! Nice staff. Good selection of seafood. For meat esters they do have some juicy looking dishes. Haven't tried them as we don't eat red meat but saw others enjoying. Must try place for definite.","4 из 5 кружков","19552DA4781863C0A6558956C518A4AA","Отзыв написан 18 октября 2013"

"I've been to Beijing 12+ times and have to eat at Let's every visit. They have the BEST burgers, french fries and seafood. It's a little pricey compared to small, traditional chinese restaurants, but well worth splurging once to eat there. The food quality and service is excellent. Biggest, Australian grain fed beef burgers, fresh cut fries & great seafood...

"We have visited Let's Seafood numerous times and have never been disappointed! Oh the mussels-with various sauces-are superb! My favorite, the cream and herbs, or maybe the red curry? I can't decide! The grilled shrimp, fresh fish and many other things on the menu are all delicious. The burgers-we have never seen such creativity in a burger and the taste...

"I've given a bad review of it's sister restaurant but at least they cook their burgers right unlike this place and their seafood. Most of the food felt like something that is on the extended menu in a fish and chip resto in the UK - you know what I mean, the kind of place where 99% of the customers...

"We had a Sunday lunch at this restaurant located in the Nali Patio of the Sanlitun area. We ordered two sets of fries with our burgers, and were happy that the waiter informed us that we couldn't possible eat two orders. My husband had the Angus beef burger and I had the filet mignon burger, which was magnificent.","5 из 5 кружков","7F17FC515B216F3804F64DB462A2311E","Отзыв написан 31 июля 2012"

"We were looking for good Chinese restaurant with good authentic food and service. Would highly recommend this restaurant. Great food and service at a very reasonable price in good part of town. Highly recommended.","5 из 5 кружков","9CC0A4FA36FD609BB28E5E52DDAB9DFB","Отзыв написан 2 октября 2016"
"This is not a particularly fancy restaurant nor is it one of those huge multi-story places. It's a comfortable human size restaurant with delicious food. As its name states, the specialty here is the roast duck. And it is very good. A roast duck should not be dry, and those who have been to QuanJuDe know what I mean. Here...

"We decided to dine here after the numerous positive reviews as well as the cheaper price compared to most Peking Duck restaurants. Location of the restaurant is in the CBD (Guomao) on ground floor among the apartments. A fusion of classical decor and modern lighting creates for a enjoyable ambience. Food was great, the crispy roast duck was on our...

"Great food and service! The 399<U+00A5> is more than enough for four people and the kids enjoyed pretty much everything. Ring ahead, ask for some in English and the owner will be more than helpful.

"This place is a bit hard to find but trust me, the duck has been on par with 1949 and Da Dong. In addition, they had a set menu that had other tasty items for less than 200rmb pp. Can't beat that these days.","5 из 5 кружков","EBFF47BD367A17C0827EDA41196B3802","Отзыв написан 19 июня 2016"
"This is located in the Vantone Center in the CBD. I came here for dinner and had a filling and delicious meal. The menu has pictures with English descriptions.

"I took all the way from the other side of Beijing today (may 2nd) to come to this restaurant, because of the nice reviews here. They even have all the ""certificates of excellence"" hunged at the entrance with pride. When I entered, I was told ""no duck, no duck, sorry"". It was so humiliating! Was I denied service because I...

"Definitely a local haunt. The duck was succulent and delicious, and the other dishes were pretty good as well. I've been to other restaurants in Beijing for Peking Duck and what struck me about this place was how understated it was. A good place to visit if you're in the Central Business District and want to go somewhere nearby for...

"Located close to the Chaowei SOHO, this place serves very good peking duck with a hint of the apple wood used for roasting the duck. Reasonably price for half a duck, the fried pork belly with green peppers dish was very good and so too was the eggplant served in a claypot. Overall, great place at reasonable prices...","4 из 5 кружков","E4855A456B2DC05CCEA0F0E5A1E69CED","Отзыв написан 7 января 2016"
"We loved the warm interior, private tables (not family style), and amazing meals. The duck, of course, was delectable - but other dishes were memorable, especially the spicy dry-fried green beans. We ate with abandon (and drank, too) and our bill for 3 adults did not exceed $50.","5 из 5 кружков","78B9658452E92C542AA2F475F2BB8035","Отзыв написан 28 декабря 2015"
"Far less expensive than the more touristy spots rated higher, you will not be disappointed if you choose to go here instead. The duck was lean with perfect crispy skin and prepared to order in the large wood-burning ""oven"" of the open kitchen. The beer is cold and the sides, especially crispy shrimp, Beijing-style noodles, and garlic eggplant, were reasonably...

"Great Peking Duck for about half the price of some of the more well heeled joints in Beijing. No pomp and ceremony, just high quality duck in a casual atmosphere. Other dishes on the menu were great, staff was very friendly. English menu.

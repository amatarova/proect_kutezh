"The place looks really amazing, it's well design kinda rococo style. It appeals people to go there and try out the restaurant/bar. Perfect place to go at night and have drinks and dinner when visiting.","4 из 5 кружков","1F37CDCAB65A1322B8FA492BC9193CBE","Отзыв написан 20 июля 2016"
"This restaurant is simply amazing. The food is excellent, it has some specialties that cannot be found in other places like an aubergine filled with meat. It was extremely delicious. The staff is great, the menu is also in English and generally it is a high-class restaurant. That's why it is also quite expensive, but definitely worth it. The design...

"A true fantasy art and dining in one place. The food was very good, but the service was difficult to get unless you shouted for the waiter. The huge restaurant was a rare treat for the eye. The cavernous space was decorated with unique and imaginative taste for decor in walls, floors, ceilings(hand drawn art on ceilings!), as well as...

"If street food and small dives are not your thing -- or when you need a departure from them -- try Lan. The decor is beautiful, with modern Chinese cuisine to match. We especially like the black garlic dusted with cocoa.","4 из 5 кружков","6A526F233318467C1B6FEB60BE4B8AE7","Отзыв написан 24 апреля 2016"

"This quite a Unique Restaurant from all of my previous experiences, the decor is flamboyant and the menu is not less subtle. Is really worth to look around while you are there, feels like a museum inside Alice in Wonderland set!!

"Designed by Starck, this is one of the largest and most amazing bars I've every seen. But on a Friday night, how barren and empty, only 3 diners, and us having a coctail at 9 pm. I'm told by the manager that dinners are full monday to Thursday. The bars are always empty. The coctails are great, the mirrored bathrooms...

"Our experience is probably an outlier; that said, during a busy lunch, the service we received was (honestly) just terrible. Napkins were not provided at the outset (and not provided until almost half-way through our luncheon, after 2 separate requests), our drink orders were forgotten (not once, but TWICE!!!), at one point I raised my hand to attract attention (this...

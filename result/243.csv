"I have been here a few times and keep returning because of the reasonably priced buffet (around 250 rmb per person) - add limitless alcohol for another 120 rmb if you wish. Having a coffee or juice is another 60 rmb (not included). Good quality food and value for money. Excellent cheese selection, seafood meat and veg options all here....

"Went there for Sunday brunch with two young children and there was a huge choice of delicious food on offer. You get free choice of starters and puddings(ask for the Pavlova) and you choose a main course. Can recommend the lobster with squid ink pasta(maybe lobster a little small) and the lamb. Amazing choice of hot and cold starters which...

"If you want to have a brunch in Beijing, Feast (Food by East) would be a great choice. Food is good, enviroment is clean and service is great.

"It's becoming one of our favorite buffets for brunch and their Saturday steak night. Buffet doesn't feature the variety which some hotels offer, but what is available is of high quality. The entrees served as part of the buffet are always excellent. Service is attentive. Sunday brunch is popular with families and seems very kid-friendly which could be an attraction...

"This light, bright buffet bar/restaurant on the 2nd floor of East Hotel on the east side of Beijing is an ideal place to meet friends for a get-together.

"Really nice setting and decor but food was just ok. Went for Sunday brunch and It wasn't exceptional it was just ok, which considering the wealth of Sunday brunches in Beijing, 'just ok' really isn't good enough. Paid extra for the free flowing wine, beer and soft drinks, we had to ask then wait for it to be topped up!...

"I just realized I hadn't written a review about this place. I typically never write reviews unless they're really needed and I feel people should be warned before going to this place. Now, we've been living in Beijing for almost 2 years now and are not opposed to paying for good food, as long as the food is worth it....

"We went here with two other people for Brunch on a Saturday. It was packed so reservations are probably a good idea. Two of us opted for the 118 rmb free flow sparkling wine, wine, beer, etc.. package. They thought that was the best part of the mediocre brunch. Drinks were not replenished attentively or proactively as like in other...

You must try their signature Australian dessert. Even...

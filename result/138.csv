"I was hungry on a lazy Sunday and decided to head out to Element Fresh nearby for a quick meal. The restaurant was clean and half empty when I arrived.

"service is OK, not that they are not polite, it's just the waitresses are not very smart, only 2-3 orders and still didn't pick up what we wanted... not sure is it because I didn't speak well Chinese or they really didn't get what I meant. The food are not bad. Just not much choice on food selection.","3 из 5 кружков","717779B721919E489B1ECC058F566A7A","Отзыв написан 10 октября 2016"

"Element Fresh is a fantastic cafe chain in Beijing. Normally in China I eat the local food but the freshness of this food sent me crazy for western style food. One can actually buy sandwiches here with real bread. Order one between 2 for lunch and add a Wonderful fresh juice each. Breakfast has pancakes but I couldn't eat the...

"Element fresh was so 2014. Now sadly they have increased prices, and made the food smaller. The staff has been good when I went but just quality is down the drain. There are much better places that have not increased their prices to 70 RMB or more for a salad. I mean some salads are 120 rmb! This is not...

"Quality like a roadside cafe. Service rotten from moment you come in. Staff untrained. No complimentary bread basket and cutlery presented like a greasy spoon in paper napkins.

Never again.","2 из 5 кружков","A4DC2B0B371DFAA82F2BC1252AF49380","Отзыв написан 14 августа 2016"

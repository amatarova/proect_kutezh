"First time at Sunlitun, but found Japanese Food easily. During lunchtime it's not so crowded but it's very nice there. Food was very good. We had the Day Dream the California Roll and the Wasabi Challenge. Everything was excellent. Please take care Wasabi Challenge is REALLY spicy. Recommendation: anytime","4 из 5 кружков","9267A5571B067A8B0DF9371BC4A3EA96","Отзыв написан 30 ноября 2016"
"Date night with the wife. We were in Beijing for the week. Sushi sounded very good, so I found this place on TripAdvisor. We arrived about 30 minutes early not knowing they weren't open yet. But, they seated us just fine. We sat at the sushi bar. Most all the dishes we had were very good. One roll flavor was...

Well designed place to spend some time for couples or companies. I can't even count how many times I was there,but during our last visit we have been waiting for our meals for too long.

"If you're gonna go to Hatsune, you should always go to this branch. Although their selection is very creamy, mayo-y, and cheesy, it is the best sushi you'll find in Beijing, hands down. The selection is not too too pricey considering the quality, we would usually spend around 5-600 rmb but we would be rolling out of there from stuffing...

"Hatsune is in a convenient spot--you can stop here after a walk through Sanlitun, or before an evening out through the bar scene. For those who seek authentic sushi and sahimi, this is not going to satisfy you. But if you're a fan of Japanese flavors, and like 'fusion' style food, this isn't bad. Among a group of 10, we...

"Popped in for a quick lunch - can't rate this place highly enough. I used to live in Beijing and Hatsune was a favourite so while back in town on a business trip wanted to see if it was good as I remembered.

"I love the ambiance of their Sanlitun branch and definitely their food. Their grilled salmon head is awesome as well as their sushi. Tried their steak with foie gras but it was just average... i find the meat dry..tempura was great though.

"It's casual, a bit chic, and best of all its apparent that this place cares about their product. I've been a fan of this place for awhile but just recently found out that they have a 'secret dish' every month. The staff are friendly and attentive (for the most part) and the atmosphere is sometimes loud, but that can be...

"Fresh sushi and sashimi. Grilled fish and meat are also fine. Famous for its innovative Japanese rolls, but not my personal favourite. I consider Hatsune generous to serve a small appertiser and a small dessert over dinner. As it is inside the Kerry complex with offices and hotels in CBD, it can be full at around 6:30 - 7:30 pm...

"I went to Hatsune Sanlitun branch. The decoration and atmosphere is fine. This wouldn't be a great choice for those who like the traditional style. it's more Californian style and fushion dishes.

I'm in Beijing for 5 more days and probably return to Hatsune...

"Used the restaurant for convenience as I was staying at the hotel. Service and food was good and it was quiet enough for our business discussion. Somewhat expensive but that is to be expected in a hotel","4 из 5 кружков","6B2AB5945D1BEFCF474881106DB1DFF3","Отзыв написан 18 января 2017"

"I asked for the menu. I was given a clipboard. Loose sheets of printed menu. Ordered the hainanese chicken rice. Wrong choice. What came out was a shadow of the real thing. Don't order this. To top it off, one hotel sales staff came and asked me stupid questions like how many of us, and what am I having....the waitstaff...

"This is really a restaurant that you would use if you are staying at the Westin Hotel. It is perfectly good for in-house dining, including breakfast, but for something special go elsewhere","3 из 5 кружков","F4FEF9C60305D75B828EB64C9FA0AE73","Отзыв написан 25 марта 2016"
"We visited in the evening with a small group of six. Service was slow, no wine selection, and food had hits and misses. Lighting is cafeteria harsh, and music a little too loud. A safe venue but completely lacking in atmosphere.","3 из 5 кружков","427DAB3F4E6C5F1338AD5A7D3CF92421","Отзыв написан 13 августа 2015"

We were escorted to the second floor and warmly greeted with gifts, mimosa or juice served by a girl wearing a dress of...

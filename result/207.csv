"I've tried the food, risotto, steak, pizza and kid's menu for several times, while what impressed me mostly is the takeaway service, especially towards lasagne. They offer a china bowl with lasagne in it, and I can feel eating 'dinner' instead of just takeaway food.","4 из 5 кружков","6501A18D2D9311BDB11ACD124F3846DB","Отзыв написан 4 июля 2016"
"За время жизни в Пекине очень полюбили ресторан Annie's. Это сеть, но мы чаще всего бываем в районе The Place. Разнообразное меню, есть чем накормить детей. Все члены семьи останутся довольны. Продукты всегда свежие, практически все готовят под клиента. Мы не фанаты пиццы, но тут она действительно вкусная. Цены приемлемые. Персонал приветливый, все официанты говорят на английском. Мы советуем данный...

"My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here recently with dinner one evening. We dined here and had a secluded table by the window.

We enjoyed a buffalo mozzarella dish and...

All dishes are amazing, but the first courses (pasta), cheeses and deserts are especially memorable.

I do not recommend the house wine.

"Mercante is a small, but authentic Italian restaurant that boasted good service from an Italian waitress, good food and wine. They were not stingy with bread and refilled our bread when asked. The meats and cheeses to start were fantastic and the Ravioli was very well made. An enjoyable location that is surrounded by other fun areas such as Nanluoguxiang...

"This restaurant is great! It's so difficult to find good Italian food in Beijing (and China generally) but to find a place that serves panna cotta (let alone a fantastic one) is just such a nice surprise. I ate here a lot when I lived in Beijing. It's a little pricier compared to local restaurants but it's well worth it....

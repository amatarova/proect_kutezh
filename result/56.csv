"Breakfast buffet has lots of good selections (blueberry muffins are excellent!) with a good selection of Chinese and Western foods.

Apart from the usual square or rectangular tables, they also have a few round tables, good for business contacts/meetings. The service was very good -- no waiting for a table and the staff...

"Just like Tim's Texas BBQ, 3 Colours Lotus has moved because the Army wanted their building back apparently. It's now in a sterile new mall (SOHO) around the corner on Guanghua Road (Floor 2). The service is still very good and there is a good range of dishes. However the food didn't seem to be as good as I remember...

"On my way from Kerry Hotel to Silk Street I saw a small board Indian Restaurant in window. We decided to explore it once back from shopping. This restaurant is in the mall on first floor if you are visiting late evening it would look very quiet just take the escalator and go to 1st Floor. Food is authentic here...

"Great food, genuine Indian taste, reasonable pricing. Many vegetarian options. Close to various good hotels and yong'anli subway station, I stayed in jianguo hotel which is around 100 mtr. If you are an Indian vegetarian looking for good food in budget then this is the right place.","5 из 5 кружков","23A5C752EE6AA9B224CE548920B022A5","Отзыв написан 24 декабря 2015"
"I really very happy with this restaurant. The foods are very good, feels like having dinner in India. Staffs are also good, one guy is from Balasore (Odissa). Nice to talk to them also. The owner is a lady who visited India so many times and also very nice and friendly. Really, it is a very good restaurant. Five stars...

"Second Indian restaurant to visit in Beijing and I was not disappointed. Food was very good and service was even better. Manager Chandan stands out and will help you in every possible way he can. Other wait staff are polite as well. Will certainly visit next time.","5 из 5 кружков","C99398DF37E904F965159EDDA8DD4B21","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2015"

"Indian food as good as we can get back home, London :-) . The full range of dishes is on offer with very friendly advice. The food was excellent a pleasure to get away from hotel food. This is Indian food not a local copy. I'll be back.","5 из 5 кружков","6F6824984FEBDAEE5940EE58A6E09D8A","Отзыв написан 15 июня 2015"

"I had gone to Yashow Market for shopping. After 2 hours of walking around the Mall, I was tired and hungry. When I was about to leave the Mall, I saw an advertisement near the main entrance about an Indian restaurant at the food court upstairs. I went up and started looking for the restaurant. It was delightful to hear...

"I found this restaurant by chance when traveling on the bus and we immediately got down as it was lunch time. The restaurant is on the first floor. The restaurant is large enough with nice decor and helpful staff. The menu is extensive with north Indian varieties. We ordered many veg dishes which was served hot but it took time....

"Nice looking menu with a lot of typical India dishes and even pictures of Indian looking chefs that should be cooking your food, but I doubt that there's nobody from India in this place. My Chicken Korma was just small pieces of chicken in white sauce without any taste of Indian spices. Naan bread (with paneer) was like a small...

"Found this nice little 2nd floor Indian restaurant some 200m around the corner of Jianguo Hotel, on the opposite side where Silk Market is located. They have a good variety of veg and non-veg Indian food. The chicken tikka masala that I ordered, tasted authentic as also the naan and saffron rice did. Born in Germany, I was happy to...

"We tried to go last night (after reading the recommendation in latest Lonely Planet) but it was all shut down, the doors barred, and a notice in Chinese on the door which I imagine says something along the lines of ""closed until further notice"".","1 из 5 кружков","CBE4AB3AA54EFBD53FC086E1D05FC93A","Отзыв написан 1 апреля 2016"
"Pricey! But worth it, it is a vegetarian buffet restaurant when the foods offered are always updated with newer dishes. Like the freshly wrapped sushi cone.","5 из 5 кружков","45A9194F8DA83699DFAFA408F932E6D4","Отзыв написан 27 февраля 2016"

"From our perspective, the food was OK; nice buffet, many dishes to choose: soups, tofu, cakes, cookies, salads, etc. Very crowded sometimes. Food price is good. Take a chance to visit it if you go to Guozijian, recommended for large groups or couples.","3 из 5 кружков","8C3CA572353BE3BC8BF2BE77D8FF9C44","Отзыв написан 1 сентября 2015"

"We went for lunch and it was a large buffet with many vegetarian dishes. At lunch it was very popular and we had to wait a moment to get a table. A nice assortment of foods with many tofu ""meats."" No complaints. My review might be higher if I wasn't a carnivore at heart. Great variety however for my husband,...

"We went for lunch and really enjoyed the buffet. There was an amazing variety of dishes with desert as well as mains. You would be hard-pressed if you couldn't find something you liked here. One tip, get there early. The food was not quite as hot as we would have liked it.","5 из 5 кружков","3BEA9EC1A74941D3345F6516652E4EFD","Отзыв написан 26 июня 2015"
"This largely vegetarian restaurant is located almost opposite the Confucius Temple. We stopped here for lunch after seeing the Lama and Confucius Temples. It is a large restaurant but was packed at lunchtime and we had about a ten minute wait for seats. The meal was buffet style and relatively inexpensive. There were a number of vegetable, salad, rice and...

"Overall I'm happy with my experience at this place. I usually try to avoid spending too much at restaurants and this place is a great value. The buffet offers mostly imitation meats made of wheat and soy, including beef, pork, chicken, fish, even recreating sushi sashimi and pepperoni pizza. There are some non ""meat "" veggie dishes as well, and...

"Cheap (<U+00A5>68pp), cheerful, tasty, plenty of choice for vegans too. The evening buffet (after 5.30pm) is quieter than lunch. It is Buddhist so don't expect alcohol.","4 из 5 кружков","C1B18A544F2C76073970DE1EFEE224ED","Отзыв написан 24 мая 2015"
"I really like meat, so I seldom eat in vegetarian restaurants, but this one, close to the Confucius temple in Beijing, seemed special when we passed it. And it is. You pay about 70 yuan in advance, and then a wonderful buffet is waiting for you. Choice is plentiful, with even some mock chicken and beef dishes. All sorts of...

"This is a huge buffet style restaurant near a big temple. There are a lot of choices. If you are vegetarian and worry in other restaurants what you might get, come here, as you can see it and all is vegan. This is a huge place in the middle of small Beijing Hutongs, you pay flat rate for buffet of...

"As non-Mandarin speaking veggies, we were worried about eating in China so I did a bit of research on Trip Advisor & it appears that there are more veggie restaurants in China than England! Every town seems to have at least one, often as part of a Buddhist Temple complex. We found this restaurant on our first night in China...

"This has got to have been the best veggie/vegan restaurant I have ever visited. The price of roughly 70 yuan for an all you can eat buffet (drinks, dessert, coffee included) is great value. There is more choice than any vegetarian buffet/restaurant I have been to. The food is of great quality, mostly Eastern but with a few Western dishes....

"I went into this restaurant on a complete whim, having not read any reviews. I happened across it as I was wandering aimlessly round the temple area (all the temples were closed btw, they shut at about 4.30pm in winter time). I arrived around 5.00pm. I THINK it cost about 80 - 85 yen for the all you can eat...

"In a country where vegetarian food is hard to find, this place was my Disneyland. This restaurant is less than a minute's walk from Lama Temple. The buffet offers a huge choice and since everything in it is vegetarian, we were able to try various items without having to worry about ingredients. The food was very well prepared/presented and full...

"As a non-vegetarian i must say that this is really an extraordinary restaurant. The quality of the dishes is great even though they are plenty of them. Normally buffet means many mediocre dishes. There is something for everybody. Even the prices are very reasonable. This came just in time after a very long morning walking. I would definitively visit again!","5 из 5 кружков","22A27455E98E3700858A988F6738ED96","Отзыв написан 6 сентября 2014"
"After reading all of the great reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to try this veg restaurant over some of the other veg restaurants highly rated on Trip Advisor or recommended in lonely planet.

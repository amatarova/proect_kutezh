"The food here is consistently very good, comparable with for example Pizza Express in the UK. Service is friendly and helpful and the delivery service is efficient too (they can usually take your order in English, but it would help you to have the menu with you when you call them because each item has a code number).","4 из 5 кружков","49FDD47E68EB82123E1A8F1B3E5AF0C6","Отзыв написан 8 июня 2016"
"For the Americans reading this, think one step up from the Olive Garden (without the endless bread sticks and salad). Never had a bad meal from here, they are always consistent.

"If I were to judge only the dishes quality and the money that I have paid, Annie's is a very acceptable place for fairly tasty Italian food that doesn't cost much.

"This is a very nice restaurant, pulling out all the stops on classic Peking cuisine and roasting the ducks right in the middle of the restaurant.

Obviously the Peking Roast Duck Pancakes were fantastic but so too was the ""fried squirrel fish"" in mandarin sauce. I've never had anything like it but it was a beautiful fish, both to look at and to eat.

Prices are very reasonable and the service is attentive but only if you speak Chinese. We arrived before our hosts and spent an uncomfortable fifteen minutes being ignored by staff too scared to try and speak to us!! Not a problem, just the reality of non-tourist places in China.

All up, a very good Chinese dining experience and I'll definitely be back.","4 из 5 кружков","BCB8090E3403D092F5F11DDEC189F07D","16 марта 2017"
"I went with some friends due to a hotel recommendation. It totally changed my opinion on Chinese food. Food was great, loved the filled tomatoes, the dumplings and the duck. Very reasonable priced for what you get. Nice decoration. No English with the staff but this is pretty the norm in Beijing .","4 из 5 кружков","8531B5F434FE90FBD0D927AF5B38285C","14 марта 2017"

"Wow, amazing food, great restaurant and incredible location. The Pekin duck was the best of my entire trip but also wine and desserts.

The only problem is the language ! Nobody but just one employee speaks a little English, even ask for sparkling water was a funny situation.

10/10!!! Highly recommended","4 из 5 кружков","B99A3B3BA3FA004EA21B813D3FDB5D23","26 февраля 2017"
"Roasted to order and delicious, D Dong now has two sizes; a smaller duck perfect for two, rather than a half large duck. Crispy, not greasy and carved at your table, all you need is two more dishes (from their complete menu), some rice and a glass of wine and there you have a memorable meal. Service was warm and helpful with English no problem. Setting is modern with proper table settings. A dining experience to enjoy!","5 из 5 кружков","2BF55F669875316855DA868B70C7D5FE","22 февраля 2017"

"The duck was delicious. The place we didnt like a lot because it was hot and too full. We also had noodles and rice and were all amazing. The restaurant is beautiful and every dish is a work of art and delicious! Of course the masterpiece was the duck which is a must when visiting China.","4 из 5 кружков","748617BC87ABF010E906059AC240A0DC","9 февраля 2017"
"Travelled to Beijing for a few short days whilst in China and had a local driver to take us to our accommodation and also the Great Wall. He recommended this place to us and it did not disappoint!! Huge restaurant and so much Duck! It was melt in your mouth and a great atmosphere.

"My sister had read the reviews and determined that this would be a dinner stop for us. We arrived at the restaurant at 5:30pm, just after seeing an acrobat show. The restaurant was fairly empty. But, the hostess showed us a paper that said we had to be done but 6:30pm. I'm guessing they were expecting a full house based upon reservations. Our server did not speak English, but made every effort to help us make good selections. We knew we wanted the duck...why else would you go there? He suggested a side dish that was so good. Not sure what it was called, but it was very good. It was a dish of sauteed greens with garlic and butter. It was very tasty. While it was wilted, it was still crisp in my opinion, it was cooked perfectly. They brought out our duck and watching the chef slice and plate it was a treat. Be sure to order the condiments. Another server who spoke some English, gave us a demonstration on how to eat the duck. Everything about it was superb. After our meal, we were presented with some fresh mandarin oranges that were so sweet...a great palate cleanser. And for all this, we paid $66US, including 2 beers. We had read that this place was pricey. The atmosphere suggested the same. The service would justify a higher price tag. But, that was not the case. We had an excellent meal, a true Beijing foodie experience, and all for what we felt was extremely reasonable. Oh, and we walked out of the restaurant at 6:30pm without ever feeling rushed. Don't miss this one!","5 из 5 кружков","51D6F685F04F5E981577EBEB27A2ECBA","8 марта 2017"
"I went two times to Da Dong and I can recommend the branch in Sanlitun since the atmosphere is very nice. The Beijing duck is delicious and the other dishes are very good as well. Overall, I will definitely go there next time as well even though it is quite expensive.","4 из 5 кружков","5E06998120A001E484AA8EAAF1154410","Отзыв написан 3 февраля 2017"
"The duck is superlative, so I'll move on to the other meals (the menu is quite extensive): they're all amazing. From fried rice to braised beef, each dish has such bold yet complex flavours that they're unlike any other Chinese restaurant I've been to. You really can't go wrong.

The service is great and because it's Peking duck, you won't have to wait long at all. We also received free lanterns because it was Chinese new year!!

Importantly, it's much cheaper than you'd expect for such a high-class restaurant.","5 из 5 кружков","74EFEC13502EE4B4FE7E4886F832FA9A","Отзыв написан 30 января 2017"
"I went to this place for dinner, along with my other colleagues (including locals), after our training session. Now, Im a (Indian) vegetarian, little did my colleagues knew prior. So they ordered a lot of meat, including the famous Peking Duck. Soon, I was enjoying some salads, and tried some of the deserts, not very sweet though. The overall ambiance was quite good, not sure if they have many veg dishes. It was a good experience.

"Da Dong is the place the hotel sends westerners when they want to have Peking Duck in Beijing. Da Dong is a good choice but their are better places that are less expensive when you are with the locals.

"In the summer of 2015, on our trip to China, my family and I went to the Da Dong Roast Duck Restaurant during our short stay in Beijing. It was recommended by our travel agency. This very modern restaurant, located above a shopping mall, is totally unexpected while walking through the neighbourhoods of Beijing. The restaurant emits quality and hygiene, which is not obvious in China. The food itself was absolutely scrumptious. We all went for the duck on the menu because you can’t go to Beijing without having the famous Peking Duck. It was well cooked and delightful. Although, the service wasn’t very good. We had to ask several times for drinks and we had to be very patient to getting our food, even though the restaurant wasn't very busy.
I would highly recommend it to others. Although, you have to keep in mind that the food is pretty expensive.","4 из 5 кружков","F2340856DA20D5E2B4A176735A11F6A5","Отзыв написан 22 января 2017"
"So, this place is right next to a multi floor shopping mall, where we wandered around lost for a good half an hour. Go outside of the mall and take the elevator up.
That said, great food, we all had the duck, of course. They cook it in giant open flame ovens that you can see.
The restaurant itself is beautiful and modern.","4 из 5 кружков","A5B3F3A7A6B12A399D82DEE0BCF6D6EC","Отзыв написан 18 января 2017"

"We were recommended toe Da Dong restaurant in Wanfujing Street and the reviews on Tripadvisor were accurate.
We had to queue for about 30 minutes at 1930 and this is normal unless you have a reservation. We had been told that the restaurant did not accept reservations after 1830 but that doesn't seem to be correct.

We had half a superlean Peking Duck (288 Yuan for a full duck) and some prawns between 2 people. Certainly enough food. The beers were cheap at 30 yuan for 2 but the tea was 128 yuan for a pot which is pricey!

The duck was delicious and better than anything I have had elsewhere.
Total cost about 450 Yuan for 2 people. Would certainly recommend highly.","5 из 5 кружков","8611AB83B87D7C1BBFD9EA21655E6057","Отзыв написан 8 января 2017"

"Disgusting service,very expensive and very bad food.The roast duck is burnt and other food that we ordered tasted no better than ordinary canteen food despite being five times more expensive.Service was practically non existent,for a glass of water, you need to ask for several times and soup was still not served even after we've paid the bill.There are definitely loads of much better restaurants with fair prices,more delicious food and more traditional surroundings than this overated,modern, vulgarly designed dump that does not reflect any Chinese heritage in both food or dining environment.","1 из 5 кружков","7EB06828257FDDBC8E4F18BC3CE2DD17","Отзыв написан 27 декабря 2016"

"We wanted to try Peking Duck whilst in Beijing and read in the Lonely Planet & online about Da Dong. We made a booking however we arrived at the wrong branch of the restaurant. However the staff were still able to seat us at a shared table which was still fine. We ordered a roast duck with 2 sets of condiments for my husband and I this was plentiful. It included soup and a fruit platter. The duck was the most amazing duck we have ever tasted. Very lean but still delicious crispy skin. I would recommend booking (and checking not is the correct branch) as many of the private tables had excellent views over the city.","5 из 5 кружков","EC715668079B21BBC8D6A7F501A339DA","Отзыв написан 21 декабря 2016"

"My friends and I had roast duck at Da Dong twice, simply because it was so good. We've tried Duck de Chine and Jing Yaa Tang which were not bad, but this is really the best.

Service was also impeccable. The servers took the time to explain to us how we were supposed to eat the ducks, and they also gave us complementary shaobing (hollowed biscuits that you stuff the meat, radish, minced garlic and hoisin sauce in, a specialty that only Da Dong has), when we said we really liked it.","5 из 5 кружков","D2DD1BC40689106360175E0A14C426CD","Отзыв написан 10 декабря 2016"

"We have been eating Peking Duck in the US for over 25 years and so were excited about our eating it in Beijing. We made a reservation at Da Dong which was well reviewed and near our hotel.

First, the attitude was wrong. They wanted us to sit next to the waiter's station ... sorry, but no. Next choice another waiter's station. Now time for the manager and after a conversation and a wait we were seated in the main room. If you are here for the decor then this restaurant is a winner.

However, it is not a winner if you want the famous duck unless presentation is more important than a dry, bland duck hurriedly served as if it was fast food. Move you in, serve you and move you out.

And the Las Vegas production of grapes for desert in no way makes up for the unsatisfactory service or food.

Again, sound and fury signifying nothing. Look elsewhere, even in the US for excellent Peking Duck.

"Our tour guide took us here our first night in Beijing. The restaurant was close to our hotel so we just walked over from the Regent. We ordered the duck, of course, and then our guide ordered us about 8 other dishes to go with it which was way too much for us. But we tried a little of everything. Everything was sooooo good... The food was wonderful, the restaurant itself is very nice....and busy, busy! If you have room try the fried ice cream for dessert. I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you are in Beijing and especially if you are staying at the Regent. Just for fun we checked out the other restaurant on the same floor which is a movie themed restaurant and has rooms decorated according to different movies.

"We wanted to find a highly recommended authentic Mandarin restaurant in Beijing and this exceptional restaurant exceeded expectations.
Not easy to find but spacious surrounding gardens lit up at night are the first clue of a special experience about to unfold.
A large space with high ceilings and dramatic sculptures set the stage. Much of the menu is alluring but I recommend following the signature dishes. An extensive wine list provides many options, although back your judgement on wine selection rather that the service staff recommendations.
The Peking Duck is legendary and for good reason. The wagyu with lime and ""chicken soup"" were also spectacular.
Oh, and a massive screen showing the celebrity chef's travel adventures.

"First of all - the duck is fabulous! Like all the reviewers mentioned - one of the best duck you will find. But the service was just so terrible and the staff so rude that the duck did not make up for it.
We went for lunch at about 1:30 and there was no line - we were given a table immediately. As we were looking through the big book of a menu trying to decide what appetizer and dessert and drink we wanted with our duck, this really rude lady comes up to the table and asks ""what duck?"" I understand the lack of english but it does not take a language to identify rude behavior! I pointed at their roast duck and ordered one. We told her we are still deciding the rest. And after 5 minutes while we were still looking at the pretty pictures hoping to order some appetizers, she comed back and plops chopsticks and plated in front of us. We expected the duck to be carved in front of us but this chef just carved it behind our table - I asked her if that was our duck quite shocked actually and she said yes. We did not order more after that. I told her that she did not even take our order but she did not seem to care.
I know that language can be a problem in China but I have had really good food over the last 2 weeks at much simpler places here - even at places where the staff spoke 0 english but this is the first time in China where I have been treated so rudely. I would much rather eat a less tasty duck at a friendly place than the perfect duck at a place like DaDong - that is purely a personal preference. I am not going back here again and would not recommend this place to friends and family.","1 из 5 кружков","ADAFDF2420C7B23F139458595877ACF9","Отзыв написан 27 ноября 2016"
"We went to Da Dong on a recommendation from a family friend. While we wait for almost 2 hours, it was worth it. We ordered one Peking duck to split among three people and it was enough. We also ordered two more side dishes. Everything tastes great, and the food was quickly served after ordering. One thing that made the wait better was having the free juices.

I came alone and was grateful that they serve 1/2 duck. I couldn't finish it but did my best. I also ordered the mung bean sprouts which are probably the best greens I have ever had.

One of the servers took extra care to show me the trick of folding the wrapper with chopsticks - look ma, no hands! - and came by later to make sure I was doing it right.

The tangerines on dry ice at the end was delightful. And they were sweet like candy, so no need for dessert.

"We enjoyed our dinner at Da Dong Roast Duck's Tuanjiehu location. They had excellent cocktails, wonderful service, clean modern restaurant. However, this was my first Peking Duck and I was not a fan of the crunchy bird. I like my duck moist and tender. But the restaurant was great. Had I known what the Peking duck was like, I may have ordered a large bird for just the two off us so I would get more meat. None the less, I would go to this restaurant and order something else.

"Our hotel made reservations for us at 9 PM. We arrived at 10 minutes after nine and was seated immediately. Waited about 30 minutes to have a waiter come over and take our order. When he finally took our order., He told us there was no more duck available! How could a restaurant known for peeking duck, and not have any peeking duck left. We spent the next half hour arguing with the management to make us a duck, because, it was not that they had no ducks available, it's that they wanted to close and did not want to make any more duck. Finally, they agreed to give us a half of one duck! This was after we had to even call our hotel and have the concierge intervene. We had only one night in Beijing, as we explained, and this was going to be our only mail and our only chance to have peking duck. We also ordered fish, which on the menu was approximately US$20 for 500 g. To our surprise, they charged us, three people, for 2.5 kg! Almost $100 US. There was so much fish, we could not even finish it. The food was very good, but the experience was made miserable and expensive because of the poor service and unwillingness to make any efforts. There are many restaurants in beijing and, judging from my experience tonight, I will never return. Unfortunate, because I have been there many times. They need to understand what customer service is. When they see people, they need to make sure that they can serve them the full menu, not only what they choose to cook for lack of time! The Chefs just wanted to go home, and that's why they refused to cook us a duck","1 из 5 кружков","8C4C02A3FBFCAFE2438C902D1E61C13E","Отзыв написан 12 ноября 2016"

"This restaurant was recommended by our concierge for the Roast Peking Duck. We did not have reservations but went to eat on a Wednesday nite at about 6pm. When we arrived, there were empty tables in the main dining room but the host took the 2 of us to a large round table in a back room with what looked like a curtain for a tablecloth. There were maybe 4 other tables in this back room. We sat there for about 3 minutes before we got up and went back to the Host and asked for a table in the DINING room. For our last, most expensive meal in Beijing, we did not want to sit in a dark back room! A hostess then seated us at a nice table. We ordered 1/2 of the duck, which the waiter said would be enough for the 2 of us, but could have eaten a whole duck. It looks like a lot on the platter but after slicing it up, it was not enough. I would recommend this restaurant, the service was good and the food was good, but don't take a back room table and if there are 2 of you with a good appetite, you can probably eat a whole duck!","4 из 5 кружков","383CA1051561F0BAF166B356FC658C87","Отзыв написан 11 ноября 2016"
"I stood in line here once waiting for a table and an American woman next to me asked me if Da Dong was worth the wait. I replied in the style of the Carlsberg beer advertisements that this was probably the best Chinese restaurant in the world. And it just might be. The Beijing duck is superb (skin melts on tongue) but there are many great Beijing duck restaurants around. What's great here is the other food and as usual we over ordered. Mushrooms with basil, great local dumplings, four gras cherries (must have), a delicious gong bao prawn dish, a fresh broad bean dish and a knockout crab (ok RMB1,700 for a live fresh King Crab) cooked in an egg white sauce that was out of this world. Hong Kong where I live has some amazing Cantonese places but Da Dong is my favorite Chinese restaurant I think and I try to go whenever I am in Beijing. Great cocktails as well! If in doubt, go.

"I went to have lunch with my friend. We stayed in a homestay near the restaurant, and the owner recommended us to have a meal here. The restaurant opened at 11:00 a.m,and we arrived at about 11:25 a.m. There were several customers waiting for the opening. So I suggest you go there early so that you don't need to wait...

"Suzuki Kitchen as its called in English is a quaint little place down one of the hutong off Nanluoguxiang. Pretty authentic Gyu Don and Katsu Don which was nicely done and served adequately in a bowl. The burdock salad was crisp and refreshing accompanied with a tangy dressing. Go early to avoid queuing and for your simple Japanese fix...","4 из 5 кружков","E4855A456B2DC05CCEA0F0E5A1E69CED","Отзыв написан 7 января 2016"
"It's Suzuki Kitchen in English, located near Nanluoguxiang, serving Japanese food but there is no sushi or noodle. I had tried a few restaurants around Beijing but none deserve a second visit. Maybe I wasn't lucky enough to encounter the good food except this one. I went to dine at this restaurant twice. Yes, twice. I am loving it. It...

"Kay so I basically cried when i found this place, after aaaages of oily (albeit delicious) local food... This branch of Suzuki Kitchen is located at Nanluoguxiang, in Hutong. It isn't easy to locate if you do not know mandarin and cannot read the signs - the entrance is off the main street and has a very inconspicuous door/sign! The...

"Tasty Japanese curries and ""hamburgers"" (no bread), and huge salads. Cosy setting and quick service. Try to book ahead, or put your name and number down and explore the area/try one of the many cafes or bars in the area until you're called.","5 из 5 кружков","197D0BB50E48594851B92BC72115E6BE","Отзыв написан 18 марта 2015"
"They serve Japanese comfort food here which is delicious and warming. Fantastic on a cold night in Beijing. Its often busy here, so it can be difficult to get a table on the weekend.","5 из 5 кружков","AF9E20E7A3541A70BB175570A9FED468","Отзыв написан 11 декабря 2014"

"This place is great for spending time with your friends or even to take some business groups to bit more casual dinner. The service is not perfect in here, but not bad either. The food is definitely better than service and is great value for your money. Especially I would recommend the hot pots, yummy! :)","4 из 5 кружков","EB44882B16FEED7F8A61DBAB8A62B832","Отзыв написан 13 сентября 2014"
"Authentic Japanese food with a good decoration and reasonable prices. They have three branches, but the quality is the same in every one. All are located near nanluoguxiang, worth trying if you are nearby. If you are looking for sushi, this is not your japanese. Very important to make a reservation one day in advance, always fully booked!","5 из 5 кружков","ADB42C6EF904C6B7DAE32B527D1FEADE","Отзыв написан 30 апреля 2013"
"This is a really cute and good restaurant in the middle of the hutongs. You may have to look a little to find it, but it is worth the search. Very good Japanese food at super reasonable prices (cheap to western standards, normal to Beijing standards. Make sure you have a booking. Also, when you come late, many items on...

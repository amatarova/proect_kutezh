"Had a superb dinner at this hotpot place. The only downside is the loooong line. Waited for one hour before we got to eat. I guess it's normal for this place because they are well prepared - they have seats and snacks for people who are waiting. It's our first time to order hotpot in beijing and it's very different...

"We loved this place. I'm not sure which of the branches we were in but it was at the top of a huge new upmarket shopping centre, however, I imagine all the branches would be similar.

"Hai Di Lao is a hot pot chain in Beijing. Apparently it exists in other Chinese cities as well. I went to one on the west side of Beijing near the #9 train.

"the duck is great! Service is fantastic, you can try all the other foods, but the duck is absolutely great ! combine it with a wine, not with the beers, like we did ! :) And please ask for the rose cookie at the end! great taste as well!","5 из 5 кружков","DE27FAFC4F0E1DF0F0B925E0393F63E0","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"
"Took a group of kids to this restaurant and they all tucked in. The banquet offered a great variety of authentic food with no uncomfortable surprises for the western palate. The eggplant dish was a real favorite for the adults and all dishes were beautifully presented. A great spot for family food.","4 из 5 кружков","34842DDD10D8E50FB6086247AEFD2A6F","Отзыв написан 6 апреля 2015"

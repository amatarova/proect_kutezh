"Carmen / KaMen is a tastefully decorated and very welcoming tapas restaurant in Sanlitun offering great Spanish tapas. On the Saturday evening they have an excellent live guitarist. The food was very good and reasonably priced. Service was friendly and efficient. A great place to spend your Saturday!","4 из 5 кружков","37EF1F5C37A6F43C4BAF51585945763E","4 марта 2017"
"Carmen is hidden in plain sight--a gem for casual dining in the middle of bustling Sanlitun (north) road. Squeezed between 3.3 and Nali Patio building, Carmen offers a bright and cozy spot to enjoy tasty tapas and great cocktails. The best dishes were the patatas bravas (get one of each, as they offer two different sauces) and the croquetas, but...

"Went to this restaurant with my wife a couple of nights ago. The restaurant has a few tables outside, which are apparently very popular in Beijing this time of year. We were too late for that, so had to sit inside. The interior is very cosy and nicely done. Another nice thing is that they have live Spanish/latin music, even...

"We were reccomended to go here by the hotel. This is a place visited by mainly locals and was super busy even later in the evening. Staff is super friendly and they make great gin and tonics. The served morcilla which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. The privces are reasonable and they also have live music ....

"Carmen it's the best choice in Sanlitun area to have what is called REAL SPANISH food. Excellent flavor, but small portions. ""Jamon"" and ""Curado"" cheese cuts are very small and expensive, but very tasty. Their Paellas are great too, but we think should cost less. Small dishes like potato cakes, olives and other snacks are quite good for spending an...

"The Food was great and the atmosphere was amazing as they had live music and great food to pair it with. We had the Paella which was fantastic along with some skewers and other delicacies.

"As recommended by my friend, I went there for dinner on a Friday evening. Food is amazing. The paella is one of the best I have ever had (comparing to the paella I had in Spain and in Hong Kong, my hometown). Staff is attentive and food arrives fast. I was struggling between the other Spanish restaurant on the 3/F...

"Carmen is a small cute restaurant in Sanlitun. It is slightly hidden so make sure you check it on the map before going there or you might likely miss it. The menu is large and there is something for everyone. I personally enjoyed the grilled fish with garlic and lemon. It takes awhile to be prepared but worth every minute...

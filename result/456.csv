"In Holiland you get an excellent and cheap cup of coffee, half price from other coffee shops. The service is excellent, nice people working in the shop. The bakery is super good and you can taste everything before you buy it. An extra plus care the toilets, clean and nice.","5 из 5 кружков","344C7BE1C509422C885150E73B41E1B9","14 февраля 2017"
"Cheap, tasty and luxurious. Holiland is the best bakery I have ever been to, with great service and a huge selection of tasty food. You can guarantee to get a huge meal for two under 50RNB. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Beijing.","5 из 5 кружков","D5580B04BD6FDDD314D02D10642C1871","Отзыв написан 18 января 2017"

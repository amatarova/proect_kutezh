"Walked by it and loved what we saw. Went to the end of the street and something told us that we should go back. So we did. Waited a bit because all of the tables were taken but it was sooo worth it. Food was awesome, the service was ultra fast, prices unbelievably low for what we had. I'll go...

"A shoulder of lamb cooked (by you) over hot coals set in the middle of your table on the side of the road.....an extraordinary experience.

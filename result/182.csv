"We were so fortunate to be staying at the Red Wall Garden Hotel, so this delicious restaurant was right at our doorstep. Beautiful decor, great service, great atmosphere. We loved the food here, and it was reasonably priced for the convenience to our hotel and the quality of the food. We both had the orange pork ribs and the meat...

"Nice setting but kitchen was closing at 915 and no more guests. Food ok but nothing special. Embarrasing that they charge a 15% service fee.","3 из 5 кружков","AD7821694B83E42AD5DDB33F9FF5DD2A","Отзыв написан 18 ноября 2016"
"We ate in the inside part of the restaurant because it was taining tonight. Last night we didn't eat here but we walk through the courtyard to our rooms. It is comfortable and relaxing. There is a nice quiet waterfall, nice seating, etc. food selection is nice, mostly interesting Chinese options but also some western choices.","5 из 5 кружков","80CB77082D201A1203502D50A22E790F","Отзыв написан 18 августа 2016"
"This was a great find and we ended up booking the hotel for our return to Beijing. This is a small hotel with a tranquil courtyard in the middle of Beijing. They have a little stage where they have performances but the food is amazing. There is a choice of dishes from all around china and snacks an experience on...

"The location is great as the hotel is located in a hutong, thus without any traffic noise. Water cascade noise, bird songs, sun... Nice atmosphere. I went there a couple of times for a drink, which are actually quite pricey. Incidentally, I once ordered a double expresso and after a loooooong wait, I finally got a plain american coffee (not...

"We loved the courtyard during the spring time, and sat outside for a dinner. Very nice food with authentic Chinese flavor. As a Chinese, I do think it is worth the money we paid. I would definitely recommend to my friends around.","5 из 5 кружков","6FA5B5782BE386B03CFF1DDD039C72F8","Отзыв написан 27 апреля 2016"

"One of the nicer restaurants I visited in Beijing as we were able to relax and enjoy some local dishes without the stress of the menu being misleading (maybe due to translation in other cases). Unlike other restaurants in the area, when something was described as a vegetable dish that's exactly what it was and it didn't have a meat...

"Наш гид привел нас сюда в обеденное время. Заняли столик под открытым небом. Заказали похлёбку из какого-то мяса с рисовой лапшой. Несколько салатов. Все было очень вкусно. И главное, что продукты очень свежие.","5 из 5 кружков","551FBEEDD5CE8508173165C36C270717","Отзыв написан 8 ноября 2015"
"We at eat this restaurant a couple times during our stay at th hotel. At all times, the service was prompt and friendly. We especially enjoyed the chalkboard daily specials, which we enjoyed a variety of noodle dishes. The presentation of the times was nice (stone plank, flowers as decor). The dessert menu was satisfying. One time, they brought us...

"The bar/restaurant is very cool, it's outdoors and of course a few steps from the hotel...BUT the beer was about $12 each and the food was only average, nothing amazing or even that tasty for the price. It was nice to sit and have a TsingTao but the price was annoying.","3 из 5 кружков","8D0CD516233FE3AE83DBED10FCED290F","Отзыв написан 22 сентября 2015"
"My husband and I chose the Red Wall Hotel for its hutong feel. However that seems to be a popular choice for many foreigners. As such, the prices at the bistro are inflated ($4 for a coke!) but the food is just average (compared to what you get at a native restaurant). It's convenient and still tasty, but not the...

"We loved this restaurant because it made you feel you were really in beijing and the food really was amazing. We ordered from the daily specials and realized that there is a noodle chef preparing this in a kitchen visible to all. This chef pulls the noodles which is a show on its own and we had a choice of...

"One thing I really dislike about high end restaurants in Beijing is: some Chinese staff never try their best to speak English constantly especially when there is at least one obvious foreigner in the group. I'm an oversea Chinese and yes, I speak Mandarin but I like to be treated as a guest instead of a translator. Here's the thing,...

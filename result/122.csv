"The Brown Door (I've never heard it referred to by its Chinese name) is the perfect place to get a lunch or snack after visiting the Temple of Heaven or the Pearl Market. A favorite dish is the shredded potatoes - they're addicting! Simple place, not fancy, but hits the spot.","5 из 5 кружков","CCBAEAE5B09DF5B786270F791B91CE67","Отзыв написан 13 декабря 2016"

"Was recommended this restaurant by the crew of BA on our flight. It's is situated opposite the pearl market. A small cafe style restaurant with menus in English. Great selection of stir fries and at a really great price. We had 3 dishes, rice and two large beers for 100rmb. Service was also good. Great little place.","4 из 5 кружков","8A638D58D7BF4C1FD0AE272E4EA41409","Отзыв написан 29 августа 2016"

"Ресторанов с названием этого прекрасного блюда в Пекине много- но этот первый по всем параметрам! Много лет назад меня привели в этот ресторан! И с тех пор я считаю, что настоящую утку по-пекински можно сьесть только здесь! Это место, где готовят ее много лет. Здесь ее ел Великий Кормчий Мао Цзэдун, великолепный дипломат и премьер Госсовета Чжоу Энлай, множество зарубежных...

"The duck was fine, but there was trash in the restaurant and in the toilet. The service was OK. The duck was sliced out in the hall, and we had to ask that the chef moved so we could see the show, but it was still hard to see. It seemed like the duck had been prepared ahead of time,...

"I recently had a banquet dinner at the Quanjude Roast Duck restaurant. The food was excellent and the service was wonderful. The other dishes were also well prepared. I highly recommend eating at any of the Quanjude Roast Duck restaurants around Beijing on a visit.

This particular location was selected by the Chinese Premier (Enlai) for its proximity to the central government.

"If you go to Beijing, you must try Peking Duck. And so I did. Quanjade is a very popular restaurant with its peking duck, and to me, it seems a bit touristy.

"Having read some other reviews I think it's worth noting that Quanjude's Beijing duck is different to the Cantonese style Peking duck that many people may be more familiar with. Indeed, as an Australian, Cantonese style Peking duck is what 95% of restaurants serve in Australia -- distinguished by the roasted duck skin being typically juicier and sliced shallowly so...

"I've eaten Peking Duck before in Singapore and I find that the Peking Duck in Beijing was way too greasy for me. I didn't like the thick layer of fats behind the crispy skin.

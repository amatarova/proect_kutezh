"Nice place. Not as big as I thought and a little 'too' fancy looking for my tastes, but the food was great and the service was attentive. If you're near The Place, and are in the mood for Malaysian food, this is definitely worth a try.","4 из 5 кружков","1619C606A20F8F99D1A0E091811BB8AB","15 марта 2017"
"Uninspiring location in a shopping mall belies a very friendly, clean, and good value restaurant with good tasty food. Some English spoken and on menu. Southeast Asian cuisine.","5 из 5 кружков","BE3489D925250139DD943A7210001908","Отзыв написан 2 февраля 2017"
"Authentic Malaysian and south Asian dishes in one place. It is located in the CBD area (The Place). The service is good and the dishes are tasty.","5 из 5 кружков","2E1DD600CE87C17B3C9F62743FDE37E0","Отзыв написан 26 сентября 2016"

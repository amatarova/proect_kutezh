"Peacock alley at the Waldorf is the bar and tea room which serves drinks, lunch, full tea menu and evening snacks.

"We stayed in the Waldorf and visited this lounge twice. The manager spent a lot of time talking to us about what to see and do in Beijing and Hong Kong (where he grew up).

"The Waldorf Astoria (where this bar is located) was located in front of our hotel (Hilton Wangfujing) and out of our 5 nights, 4 of them we finished in the bar of the WA because the atmosphere was superb and the staff and cocktails as well.

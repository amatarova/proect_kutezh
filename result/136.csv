"Legendary pizza and beer bar in Beijing. It used to be the best pizza choice until the advent of La Pizza. Still it's very popular among locals and non, you can enjoy a decent (non American style) pizza and a good Belgian beer. It's a bit hidden behind the whole Sanlitun paraphilia, so you'll need to keep your eyes open.","4 из 5 кружков","04073E0CE1B5F4A0474CBED1C38BED3D","Отзыв написан 23 августа 2016"

"Sanlitun has certainly changed since my last time there in 06' but this place is still the same. Still has a great assortment of beers and a simple but delicious selection of pizzas. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, especially on a cold beijing evening. I always enjoy my time there. Can get a bit expensive if you start trying...

"We had a private driver who helped us find this little hole in the wall. Once we got in we were very impressed with the selection and speed in which we were able to get excellent fresh clay oven baked pizza. Belgium beer is their other specialty and they do not disappoint. Excellent. Kind of a seedy neighborhood in one...

"This place is quite difficult to find, as it's in a rather shabby back alley to the west of Sanlitun Street. They've got about 10 outside tables and plenty of space inside. The interior needs a bit of refurbishing, I think, as it appeared worn and dirty. They served excellent pizza and had a great selection of beers available. The...

"I didn't actually eat anything at The Tree. Maybe I should have. Despite that, the beer is fantastic and reasonably-priced. It's always nice to go into a bar and be overwhelmed by a bunch of beers you've never heard of before. Also a nice selection of single malts and other 'spirits.' The atmosphere is perhaps the best thing about this...

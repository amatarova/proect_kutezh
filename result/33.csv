"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel concierge as an authentic taste of local culture. They only prepare traditional roast Peking duck (Beijing was originally called Peking) according to the strict customs. We were fortunate to speak with Jacklin, the owner's daughter, who showed is how to properly stuff and roll the pancakes. She also explained the unique conditions of...

"As many precious people point out, service is not great here, but you're at a restaurant in China, so don't be expect US service standards even at these prices. The star of the show is good, but not the best local roast duck I have tasted. In particular, the skin is not treated well and is served on the duck...

"The Peking Duck here was to die for! Tucked away in an alley, the restaurant is quaint, a little run down and the toilets were terrible but all was forgiven when the duck was served! Crispy skin and very delicious and even the bones were fried and tasty! Highly recommended and I would definitely go back if ever in Beijing...

"Would have given a 5 if i did not have a slightly better yet cheaper duck at another newer restaurant. Can't beat the atmosphere and authenticity. Tucked away in a hutong, will be tough to recognise unless following lonely planet. Thrill of having a duck in a 100 year old establishment is the main draw.","4 из 5 кружков","D7D8454877D79A71E5487E31BCE09DA8","Отзыв написан 29 ноября 2016"

"I was lucky enough to be visiting Beijing to see Mandarin speaking friends so communication was easy in the restaurant. The menu has pictures though so should be okay for those with a language barrier. We were late for our reservation but were led to the seats outside until a table was free (accompanied by beer). We had the Peking...

"Liqun came well recommended for its food and traditional setting so we came to this restaurant on our trip to Beijing. - The restaurant was easy to locate and is a short walk from Qianmen and Tiananmen Square.

"The place is fascinating to see the roasting ducks in the oven & the classic building in a hutong. It stops there though. Very dirty tables, smell in restaurant has to be mold & it feels damp despite the oven heat. Duck was dry and not what I had expected given such high reviews. Mediocre food in a very dirty...

"Hidden in an alley, when you manoeuvre your way to the sticky table and see the precarious and old setup, you feel like you've found the hidden gem. But you order a full duck and they fillet it away from your eyes, and you get a small plate of meat. As a comparison, I ordered the same duck at Utopia,...

"If you like more polished surroundings then this probably isn't for you. Liqun is more like going into someone's small home. It's busy and you are unlikely to get a table at peak times without a reservation. The duck, however, is really tasty. Not too fatty either.

"If you are not afraid of a shabby (for Europeans) but authentic looking ambiente, you must go there when you are in Beijing.

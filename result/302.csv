"Very attentive service & a very nice selection of cocktails. You could sit at the bar or in the lounge area, it was very chill and relaxed in there. It looks like they might've had live music, but we were probably there too early for that.","4 из 5 кружков","3801CB5DF501A292E81E8B5ACF29242C","Отзыв написан 27 октября 2014"

"Had a little trouble finding this place in the dark, but it was wandering down to narrow Hutong alley for. I can't speak for the authenticity of the food, but it tasted good and was well priced. My meal came to just under 60rmb for a main dish with rice and miso on the side.","4 из 5 кружков","B130E99AE9DE80C4BBCF15825A8DEDDD","Отзыв написан 7 февраля 2017"
"I basically don't write comments on TripAdvisor unless I think the place is overrated or underrated. For Suzuki Kitchen I just think that it's a hidden gem in Beijing and I would recommend anyone to come here. I was staying close to the Tian An Men Square and out of my 5 days in Beijing, I just had dinner there...

"walking in Beijing's Hutongs has a lot surprises. I found this low-key japanese place around Qianmen, in Doncheng district. Finally a deserved break from the hustle and bustle of the city. Excellent hot pot and beef burger for a friendly price. Loving sitting by the bar, facing at the kitchen. I can only recommend it.","5 из 5 кружков","8C5EE5392FCDA545BED6CAA7716230A7","Отзыв написан 23 июля 2016"
"I just accidentally found this place while roaming around qian men. It's not noticeable as there is no big signage of the restaurant. It's a small Japanese restaurant in hutong setting. Main dining room is quite small which made the place cozier. It has one outdoor table too good for 6-8 people. The menu prices are very reasonable and food...

"Ignore the photo above - totally the wrong place! Suzuki Kitchen is built around a low-key traditional Japanese aesthetic and has a warm unpretentious vibe. Food is surprisingly well-priced (35 RMB for a curry) and choice is wide.","4 из 5 кружков","B359A366BD255AFA41F34DA13DD65087","Отзыв написан 8 июля 2016"

"Went with a girlfriend while out exploring the hutongs in Dashilan and stopped in for a quick lunch. The food was excellent, they had a great set lunch menu and the price was exceptional for the amount of food that arrived at the table. Would definitely go back again.","4 из 5 кружков","73FB9407242B3C0A6C370710F9CECB08","Отзыв написан 28 июня 2016"

"Space-wise, you might not like it. Small tables and just enough space for the waitresses to walk around. In fact, you might even missed this place because there's no large sign at the door. Located near the Hou Hai, Suzuki Kitchen is a place to for brunch or early dinner. You should try the menu set or splitting the large...

"If a quick and cheap Japanese fix is what you're looking for, Suzuki Kitchen, which has several locations around town, is it. Be forewarned though, wait times for a table during meals are horrendous and the restaurant doesn't take reservations. That said, the majority of diners here are locals who tend to eat early so consider a late lunch or...

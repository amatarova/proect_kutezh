"Dumplings we're fresh and you can see the chefs do it in front of the open kitchen, other Chinese dishes are also great, I remember going to the 1 in Shanghai was a great experience","5 из 5 кружков","DF9CB96BDF934BCE0D54BAF70F00B213","Отзыв написан 11 января 2017"
"Been in several restaurants in China mainland and HK, Ding Tai Fung is always a weekend dinner choice for us; exactly for their dumplings (all kinds). For other dishes, prices are a higher than other restaurants with better recipes and taste, i.e: crabs are expensive and not worth at all. Overall Services are pretty standard, not adding value to the...

"I love Din Tai Fung and have been to several locations worldwide. Their dumplings are always delicious and they also offer a full compliment of other great dishes. You absolutely must try the chocolate dumpling--it is literally like heaven in dumpling form. Can't give this location a full 5 stars though because service is seriously lacking. I've been several times...

"Fantastic location right in Parkview Green which gives Ding TaiFeng a fantastic atmosphere. The dumplings are just amazing, my favourite in the world- the outside of them are of perfect consistency- not too doughy or tough. The vegetable and pork buns are also great. Not too expensive and highly recommend.","4 из 5 кружков","AA09C9A7052A2D27634951836F96166A","Отзыв написан 20 июля 2016"
"My favorite place to go to eat great dumplings (JiaoZi)!! Almost everything here is delicious. One Michelin star says it all for me. My daughter loves the small dumplings with soup (only available during weekends) and we love the regular ones with pork If you are going during the weekend make a reservation. They are really good about it even...

"Had a really nice dinner with family and friends here - although the 'setting' isn't that 'Chinese', its position within the art mall does make for quite an interesting entry and exit from the restaurant, and it's actually pretty nice. Good service, excellent food - we really enjoyed our time here.","4 из 5 кружков","641F920F72A611D9D532338FF2184376","Отзыв написан 7 февраля 2016"

"Researched this restaurant from Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We had three different types of dumplings here and they were all a taste sensation. The service was excellent with very attentive staff. We had a large dish of pork dumplings, they were so tasty succulent and the pastry was very thin..delicious!!! Then two dumpling soup dishes..they were also...

"The best 'soup' dumplings I've ever had. The rice dough was wafer thin and they packed in so much flavour, my mouth is watering just writing this!","5 из 5 кружков","531F45B5AD7AE66A70021D082DC9B50F","Отзыв написан 30 сентября 2015"
"Well the heading says it all- the pork dumplings( RMB 49), pork cutlets (RMB 38) were very good and the longan tea( RMB 18) was surprisingly refreshing. But the service was not efficient- the menu was entirely in Chinese and the staff even the one who could speak some English was totally indifferent to us- compared to Singapore din tai...

"In this ultra modern mall, this popular restaurant is situated behind a big Salvador Dali statue. If you come at lunch hour you can expect to wait, especially on weekends. However, it is really worth it and during the wait you can always have a stroll in this upscale mall. A table ""outside"" is better for conversations as inside is...

"Everything we ordered was wiped out. They were all too good esp the xiao long bao. Yes, it is not a beijing specialty but we just have to see for ourselves why it got 1 star from Michelin.

"If you LOVE dumplings, this is the place for you. This Taiwanese chain has many locations in Beijing. This one in the Parkview Green mall is where we ate on two occasions within four days. Their dumplings are exceptionally thin-skinned which makes the taste of their fillings really stand out. They also offer some interesting vegetable options. I wish that...

"On my first trip to Beijing, I tried to explore the food options as best I could and was very impressed by this restaurant. The dough/noodle of the dumpling was impressively delicate and the filling and sauces very rich. The night I visited, there were at most 5% westerners so don't worry about it being a tourist stop.","5 из 5 кружков","4AD512B02181A26BA8EB29991A19AD4A","Отзыв написан 23 ноября 2014"

"Excellent. That's about the one word summary. I would suggest ordering the crab dumplings and some other dumplings. Meats are not of their specialty; however, I would suggest smaller portions of more food. Service is also excellent. Staff might not speak English but are polite and do try their best. We were once overcharged without paying attention to it and...

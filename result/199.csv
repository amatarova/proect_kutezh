"Although I had initially thought that it's gonna be an expensive Chinese restaurant but I was proven wrong. Even though it's located inside the Avic Hotel but it's one of the cheapest finedining restaurants in Beijing, in my opinion. Their food is good and the service is better. If you like the spicy sichuan cuisine then this is your destination....

"Mei Zhou Dong Po was recommended to us by our guide. We ate at the one located on the 7th floor of the luxury in88 mall that houses Tiffany's among others. It is very modern and expensive looking with a beautifully photographed bilingual menu. Although we speak no mandarin whatsover, the waitresses were very lovely trying to accomodate us, including...

"It was a busy dinner time. The restaurant was crowded and noisy. We got a table after 10 minutes waiting. All the dishes were with mouth watering photos on the menu. The good looking food not only did arrive quick, but also very tasty. It was a good experience for Sichuan food.","4 из 5 кружков","0BCE282B236475844188868B93A1AF1C","Отзыв написан 18 февраля 2016"
"We were seven of us to have diner at the second floor. The dining room is well decorated on white tones. The atmosphere is calm and relatively quiet ( very rare in China). The service is not very professional but efficient. Dishes were all very good, well cooked (especially the fish), hot and not too much spicy. We had a...

"We were taken here by Chinese colleagues for a very late lunch - clearly after the rush as even the lights were off. Huge menu with many choices. All of the food was excellent and fresh - including the hand chosen fish recently swimming in the nearby tanks. The fish preparation was fabulous - served boneless and ""inside-out"" flash fried...

"We had a classical round table sharing meal. The food was very good with more species than normally in China. The beef with chili was great (lips went numb but it was worth it). If you like this type food this is a good place to go. I'll come back","4 из 5 кружков","0A264D7367E32932189B4EDB19430D5D","Отзыв написан 28 июля 2015"
"Went here for a business lunch with a large group of colleagues ( 10+) . The range of food we shared was excellent. The big circular table allowed us to sample everything - Fish , beef, chicken, duck - all delicious. The service was very attentive . But thank goodness for my colleagues as little english spoken here.","4 из 5 кружков","EE2DAC36AD876E5E9157146C66927511","Отзыв написан 17 июля 2015"
"This was my first meal in China, and it set the bar high! Amazing food and no tourists in sight. No English menus that I saw, though, so a phrase book is helpful for ordering. The tofu dishes were as delicious as the meat options.","4 из 5 кружков","119D402D7BE3E30B496D9632967C68EB","Отзыв написан 23 мая 2015"
"When I worked in Beijing back in December 2012, Mei Zhou was just across the street. We would go there for lunch at least once a week, and we always experienced high quality meals for a good price. Whether you feel like eating fish, meat, bird or vegetarian, you will find a great variety of dishes from the Szechuan kitchen....

"My friends and I found this restaurant tucked away on the ground floor of the Pearl Markets next to subway. They don't cater to westerners but you can request an English menu.

"Hosted on a business trip we tried this restaurant with a variety of dishes from all over china. The food was good and plenty, the service a little cumbersome, sometimes everyone would disappear and we would have to hel ourselves directly, but maybe because we arrived a bit late for Chinese standards (14.00)","3 из 5 кружков","C496BB76E95D10A109088566E3C30AEE","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2013"
"I visited Beijing only for three days but this restaurant for me was the best. We tasted some dishes with meat and with fish and all was perfect. The fish is fresh because you have a possibility to choose it directly from the tanks. The fish it's alive!!! Service is quite good and the menu does have English translation also...

"Whilst the Arrow beer on tap is very good this place lacks atmosphere. Go a few steps further down for the Arrow Brewery tap room!","2 из 5 кружков","9B7F583A4048942CEAD0FEFD727343EF","Отзыв написан 28 января 2017"

"This tiny, unpretentious restaurant surprises with the quality of both the food and the beer. A creamy hummus and a couscous salad, then a magnificent home made sausage, washed down with a pint of their own weissbier, then their IPA. Quality products, treated with care, friendly service. Who could wish for more.","5 из 5 кружков","24BFC4001598F5B58BF10715480CEDDE","Отзыв написан 24 апреля 2016"

"Although it's not listed on TripAdvisor, Stuff'd is the restaurant on one side and, on the other side, has the bar 'Arrow Factory' brewing. You have been able to get Arrow Factory beers in Stuff'd for sometime (since the beginning?) but now they've got their own home in the bar next door. They are in the same place but separated...

"This small restaurant is nestled in the Hutongs near Wudaoying hutong. Most of my party had the beers made by Arrow brewing, which were very nice but came at 40rmb a glass. They also hade mulled wine but the flavor was on the sour side. The food was excellent, save the mashed potatoes (bland), portions were filing. The steak and...

"I'm not sure of the relationship between the two businesses, but Stuff'd is a restaurant serving sausages (amongst other things) and Arrow Factory Brewery serves beer.","4 из 5 кружков","A03ACF3931CCB009C86DCE17CB88CA15","Отзыв написан 12 ноября 2015"
"This place does the best brunch in Beijing, and anywhere possibly. Crispy potatoes, perfect eggs, proper sausages, tasty mushrooms ... And it's set in this tiny hutong cafe where you can watch the local life wander by. They also do great beer, wine and evening food. It's a real local haunt.","5 из 5 кружков","6B83C418A7584245CD719117DBA8474E","Отзыв написан 11 ноября 2015"

"I love this place. It's pricey but the food is great with so many condiments I felt homesick. The beer they make onsite is great too. The place is full of foreigners trying to taste home, I think.","5 из 5 кружков","D58A9FDD19526B75267D8DB80C84306A","Отзыв написан 4 октября 2015"

"Food was good, better than average, but not fantastic. The Peking duck is among one of the best though and comes with complimentary soup. Garlic pork ribs was succulent too. Biggest selling point however is the lovely ambience in a traditional Beijing mansion.","4 из 5 кружков","A253953E2B3EC6F649BE81ADE2A9BB45","Отзыв написан 23 апреля 2016"
"Our tour guide brought some here but the food was anything but touristy. It was flavorful and well prepared. Menu is varied and the prices reasonable.","5 из 5 кружков","A7248455F0137D5800B9575ABCE45BDF","Отзыв написан 21 апреля 2016"
"Xi He Ya Ju Restaurant (<U+7FB2><U+548C><U+96C5><U+5C45>) was my 1st restaurant I visited in Beijing when I 1st came in Beijing in 2008. It had since became my favourite place in Beijing for Peking Duck (<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+70E4><U+9E2D>). I took my partner there for our 1st lunch in Beijing and he fell in love with the Peking Duck instantly. For RMB353, we had...

"This place was chosen by our tourguide for lunch. I saw the guide called them ahead and order ""peking duck"" so that it will be ready when we arrive. This simple trick can avoid some negative reviews on long waiting. Otherwise, restaurant is located in embassy area and of course, it is filled with foreigners/tourists because it is somewhat pleasant...

"The courtyard setting is very nice, and the food was very good. This downtown location was very convenient to our office, so about 8 of us went for dinner and had a great time. Service was quick and atttentive, the duck was good and overall the amounts were perfect and plentiful. We had roughly a dozen different dishes and every...

"We stopped at Xihe-Yaju for lunch as part of our tour package and weren't sure what to expect. The entry way is very unassuming but as you walk in side things change quickly. From the quaint courtyard to the indoor tree (fake but still nice) the ambiance was quite nice. I was traveling with my family as well as my...

"I have eaten here many times over the years but it is the first time I have reviewed the restaurant. Situated on the edge of Ritan Park and closed to one of the diplomatic quarters this restraint for me sells one of the best Peking ducks in Beijing. I went hear with family and although the bill was 1300 RMB...

"Xihe Yaju is my favorite restaurant in Beijing, not only because of the food, which is delicious, but also the decor. If you sit outdoors in the courtyard, you have a view of the beautiful imperial-style party rooms, and there is another outdoor terrace nearer the entrance. But if you eat inside, there are trees in the dining room, which...

"We have celebrated our wedding anniversary together with our whole family at Xihe Yaju. Not only were we served very varied excellent Beijing food from fish and crab to Beijing duck but also the whole organisation was perfect and efficient. The restaurant is situated in a charming old chinese palace and the dinner took place in typical chinese ambiente. The...

"Located on the outer side of Ritan Park, it has a nice authentic atmosphere. Apparently used to be a residence for park staff in the old days. Was there in 2008 and finally back recently. It was actually the first place I ever had Peking Duck and I was nervous about going back and recreating the moment - not disappointed!...

"The food is mediocre - below average but not terrible. Beautiful courtyard setting and decor. Polite but 'raw' service. High prices. No wonder all tables are filled with foreigners (some on a first trip to China). There are better places for Peking duck in Beijing.","2 из 5 кружков","0A27D3B0E5DF97D72EDBC29C65A5184A","Отзыв написан 11 декабря 2013"

"We arrived at 6pm , the place was empty but they still had to check if a table is free so you may better make a reservation. The food and service was very good. But liver pate was only already sold out. I recommend that restaurant if you come to Beijing just for few days or stay already many years.","4 из 5 кружков","AC928C0DA01909538404270CF7E2283A","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2013"

"We had dinner here on the first night of our visit to Beijing. There is an outside courtyard but it didn't look anything special and we ate inside, which was bustling and had good atmosphere. We ordered several dishes - good variety from a wide menu choice - and everything was delicious. This place is clearly popular both with ex-pats...

"The food was delicious. The menu was expansive, and had something that everyone could enjoy. We ordered about 15 different dishes, including two Peking ducks. I enjoyed everything. The waitresses kept our two bottles of Baiju flowing; as soon as we finished one shot, they were refilling the glasses. We had many people helping our table. They even went as...

"I've lived in Beijing for 3 years and seen a lot of it; I've eaten in a lot of restaurants, but for quality, presentation, serving and atmosphere, this restaurant wins hands down.

Admittedly, we didn't make a reservation for Peking duck, and therefore they were not able to serve duck to us. However, when we tried...

"The spices and flavors were just off enough from what we are used to as Americans that the food just isn't as tasty for our palates as it probably is for natives.

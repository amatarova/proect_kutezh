"Very good Japanese restaurant with fish & meat cooked in front of you on a plancha by a chief dedicated to your service. Nice experience, good food","5 из 5 кружков","2E8A23D8B53242FFC78EDCD53047E588","3 марта 2017"
"I'm pretty cautious as to what I eat, but this place is amazing! Order tepenyaki style from a HUGE menu and you won't be disappointed. My favorite was the mango pudding, which was very much like mango pannacotta in Italy I tried the sushi and it was great. The chef at your table made things very entertaining. There was a...

"Have not had Teppanyaki for a long time and needed an appropiate location for a business dinner with a guest from Germany. In Germany those kind of restaurants are hard to find, so I thought it is a good choice. Tairyo is a chain, thought nothing can go wrong. First of all have to say that this location is more...

"Best meal ever!!! A perfect way to end our Beijing adventure! A buffet costs only 219 yuan and then you can simple choose everything from the menu card and drinks card. With a privat chef to prepare and grill your food and a very friendly staff this is a top choice.","5 из 5 кружков","AFA49616B2740DA056DB323E52BD9DF6","Отзыв написан 9 октября 2016"

"We were 5 people, of which one vegetarian. As nobody in the restaurant speaks english it was very difficult to order food. At the end the 'vegetarian' food all had meat and shrimps in it! The other food was quite ok, delicious sushi and sashimi, very nice shrimps, not so tasty scallops and tough and chewy beef. The restaurant offers...

"The service is good don't get me wrong it's just not the level that I prefer, some places in Beijing pretend to be all you can eat and after a few plates they train the waitresses to ignore you and when you do get an order of 10 sushi you'll actually receive 3-4 this is a money saving tactic by...

"We got the restaurant recommended and wasn't disappointed at all. We did think it was a sushi restaurant, but in fact it is more focused on anything that can be fried. The concept of the restaurant is that you pay an amount and then you can order anything from the menu (except Ala carte I would guess) including drinks. You...

"Went with two colleagues, all of us wanted Japanese food and we couldn't get a seat elsewhere. Bad choice. Ordered a LOT of food, as one of my colleagues always does, and we left about 1/3 in to the meal. Beef was awful quality, not even sure that it was beef, at all. Scallops were ok but very small. Generally,...

"this place was just relocated near the old place. much better atmosphere and more spacious the food could be better if they were not serving frozen sashimis at some point of the evening. and they usually do not serve what you ordered, thinking you wont remember that some dishes were never served (it saves them money). teh best deal is...

"Tairyo's is usually a great place to go with a group of friends. The bigger the group, the better. The Sanlitun Village branch, where I went twice last week (invitation not choice!) is really nicely decorated with a good ambience - although be warned there are no bathrooms in the restaurant so you have to venture out to the public...

"Enjoyed this restaurant on the recommendation of some colleagues, while in Beijing on business. As I'm allergic to shellfish, the staff made special considerations to cook my food on a clean grill, free from anyone else's dishes. I'm still here and didn't die, so that's a win. The food was fresh and prepared quickly. The service was good and the...

"The food at Tairyo was different and exciting with variety to suit everyone's tastes. We had an entertaining and friendly chef that made the whole experience even more enjoyable as he drank with us inbetween cooking - Gambei! The food is a bit pricey in comparison to other sites around Beijing, but for the quantity and quality of the restaurant...

"Tairyo is famous for their All-You-Can-Eat package which is a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I remember noticing that their Sanlitun branch is a bit pricier than their branch at Zhongguancun. Food was really good and they had a lot of varieties too! Their sashimi was so fresh but I found that their sushi was disappointing. I also loved...

"The ingredients in both sashimi and what they grill were high class; fresh and tasty. The all-you-can-eat buffet is worth considering, as the portions are not that huge. The wines that are included are modest but then again, 268 RMB per person is not excessive for the deal and for beer you get also Asahi. Our waiter did not speak...

"I visited this restaurant for the first time during a trip to Beijing. Being Teppanyaki style, you sit around a table and your chef cooks the food in front of you. The great selling point of this restaurant chain is the all inclusive packages. For <U+00A3>25 we had all you can eat and drink for the whole evening. This includes...

"I first visited Tairyo Japanese Restaurant in Sanlitun Village in 2012. Then it was very good and this month's visit was very good as well. They have a 198 RMB everything included package at noon time and 238 RMB package in the evenings. You can enjoy Japanese Teppenyaki food at its best. The tastes are not explainable by words, you...

"Like I've read in a few other people's review of this place they would always forget some of your orders. I think it's their way of ensuring that no one wastes food. It's nice, but it does get pretty annoying ordering the same thing over and over and not having it served. The price is great for an all you...

However, I don't know if it is a rule from the restaurant or some misunderstanding, but everytime we have to order sashimi, they either forget some of them, or just don't serve at all.

"We didn't know what to expect, having had quite a few high quality teppanyaki experiences in major cities in Asia. This was a delightful, entertaining and relaxing experience, much more casual and lowbrow than past experiences, but very worthwhile nonetheless. While the quality of the food was a little uneven, overall it was very good, and the variety was impressive....

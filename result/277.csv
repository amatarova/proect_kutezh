"Having been in Beijing almost 7 years this was the first time I went to Morel's. It was pleasantly surprised by how delightful it was. It reminded me of an old diner in the US, or a European cafe. You know one of those places that have been around forever and still serve great food! The staff was very friendly...

"Is this the best restaurant in Beijing - no. Was this a fabulous meal after days of Peking duck and noodles - absolutely. Steak and chips, followed by a huge waffle and washed down with some fruit beer - hit the spot. Service was fine. Perhaps would not stand out so much in Brussels, but really made my evening!","5 из 5 кружков","C882A553765A950C627A6D7F0F644D82","Отзыв написан 27 ноября 2016"

"Annoyingly, I only discovered this restaurant the day before I left Beijing; otherwise I would have visited frequently. After a fortnight of delicious but exclusively Chinese meals, finding Morel's was a relief and a delight. I had Steak/Frites and my companion had sole with potato cones; both were superb. The only drawback was that we had to work in the...

"I used to go to Morels for great food and a wonderful environment, and so after a few years without a visit I thought it would be a good chance for a visit. I was sorely disappointed. Poor service including asking for 5 rmb for bread. We had to chase the staff to take our orders... The place has become...

"In 12.5 years of time in Beijing, Morel's has the distinction of being a place where despite untold number of visits I have never had a disappointing meal. Their steaks are always cooked to perfection as ordered and their bucket of mussels in Beijing is legendary. There may be places with fancier decor, or presentation, but I'm hard-pressed to name...

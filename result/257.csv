"Pizza Plus was my go-to when living in Beijing. All of their locations had friendly staff, and made consistently delicious pizza. You can order by the slice, or whole pie. You can add toppings for super cheap. The nutella pizza is godly.","5 из 5 кружков","7C5C82594448E3C404A396A67D6CCBF7","Отзыв написан 22 ноября 2016"

"I've been a Pizza Plus customer since they first opened. I used to live close to Liufang, and the delivery speed, taste and general service from the dzm branch were fantastic. However, when I moved to the Chaoyang Park area, I noticed some differences. The first is the pizza is just not as good. I have sent pizzas back more...

"I stumbled upon the Chaoyang Park location totally by accident and decided to sit down for a slice of pizza. My god, it was amazing. I had the forest and the imbufalita and it was the best pizza I've ever had. The owner was super nice and so was the staff. I'll be back to eat and I'll be frequenting...

"Pizza Plus opened up not long after I moved to Beijing and it's been a solid player, particularly when I want delivery. I don't eat pizza as often as I used to, but if I'm staying home Pizza Plus is great. They have a pretty sizable menu with some really diverse offerings. Their ingredients are mainly sourced from Italy or...

"In a city where ""greasy"", ""oily"" and ""rubbish"" are the best adjectives for most of the pizzas you can find, Pizza + brings a nice touch of freshness and originality. ..and at very affordable prices. Being one of the only two or three places in Beijing where you can find a homemade tomato paste, the only ""but"" is the relatively...

"Pizza+ offers a great variety of pizzas starting from the best base in town. Crispy and thin, like the great Italian pizzerias. Ingredients are fresh and abundant. You can even drink a birra Moretti in the terrace if you miss Italy. We tried an outstanding tiramisu at the end. And it is not an expensive restaurant.","5 из 5 кружков","49BF373235154DD01D61F492365529CB","Отзыв написан 11 июня 2014"
"I love it! Every kind of pizza is amazing, the chef/owner also very nice and polite. My favourite is salami pizza, there is a big selection of different kind of ingredients, real Italian taste, high quality. The first to sell by the piece in the city, they had a big idea! I highly recommend it, they have two places, one...

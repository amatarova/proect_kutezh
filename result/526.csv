"the place is great! IT is in sanlitun area which is crowded and noisy but its a great place to escape from all that craziness. the out door sitting is on the 2nd floor, very nice and lovely, inside is also comfortable. Food is great, they added some new things to the menu and has a lunch set.","4 из 5 кружков","ED954A59A3D82BCC0E9FE28FE5E27991","Отзыв написан 31 августа 2016"
"This place has some interesting (and tasty) takes on traditional South African dishes. The owner Toby is very friendly and accommodating. We arrived after the kitchen had closed and he still managed to arrange that we were fed. Will definitely return and try some of the other dishes.","4 из 5 кружков","9F49524FAD34420F80026703A765900B","Отзыв написан 21 мая 2016"

"A main meal for 3-4 on the menu had 2 shrimps, 1 scallop and 1 crab<U+00B4>s leg plus 6 large chips, barely enough for one. If you indicate it is for 3-4, then everyone should at least have one of each! The rest was ok but not worth the price","2 из 5 кружков","F3CE9BDF64FDCCDDBAD0372F0C27A32D","Отзыв написан 30 июля 2015"

"A group of us did Badaling and were so hungry! We're also from South Africa, so know our food and wine! Service was prompt and a large table was ready for us. All the food was great esp the pumpkin soup. Boerewors was a bit dry, the must upsetting thing was lack of the barman, hence we couldn't get our...

"In my business trip to Beijing I visited this restaurant twice with other colleagues. It's a hidden gem ... not at all crowded, very nice service and the food quality is excellent at reasonable price. For appetizers we ordered several items. Of these the Jalapeno popper and cheese selection were wonderful. Steak is a specialty of this restaurant. Many of...

"I visited Pinotage three times and can surely say that every time was wonderful. First of all, the staff is really friendly, welcoming, with smiling eyes and willing to help. The atmosphere is cosy, with big leather chairs, photographs on the walls and wide wine collection. (Staff is knowledgeable about the wines as well!) And most importantly the food is...

"I am not a big fan of cooking so since my arrival to Beijing last year I've tried hundreds of restaurants all over Beijing. South African food restaurant and wine bar Pinotage so far is my favourite and I can highly recommend it. I've tried most of their delicious dishes in the menu, the only ostrich burger in Beijing and...

"I went for lunch pretty recently. The food isn't as good as i remembered. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious but I don't remember it being so oily when it first opened. The service could use a bit of improving. When we went the restaurant was pretty empty and the server had to be constantly reminded to pour our...

"This is one of our favourite restaurants in Beijing and we've been here for both lunch and dinner many times. The food is always great, which is the main thing but the service is very hit and miss. The staff needs to be better educated on what is on offer at their restaurant as they often seem puzzled when asked...

"Went there last week with 3 of my friends, service definitely can do with a huge improvement. A friend of mine ordered a glass of wine and her glass clearly still had wine in it but the waiter took it away without asking, I ordered Surf n Turf which was one of the dishes listed in the menu for Beijing...

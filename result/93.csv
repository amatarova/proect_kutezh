"Lovely setting .......delicious food and plenty of dishes to choose from for Sunday Brunch. From noon til 3pm you can eat and drink as much as you want for a reasonable price.

"Difficult to find but worth persevering. Beautiful building in lovely setting with the restaurant approached over a bridge across a carp filled lake. Although very busy with a large wedding party the service was excellent.The food was good with very hearty portions. One of our party had the pig's knuckle which he would recommend and the salads were also good....

"I love the brunch here but I've also eaten dinner - the food is excellent and the location is beautiful. While it's in the middle of everything it feels like you're off the beaten path. As a self proclaimed ""professional bruncher"" this is by far my favorite brunch in Beijing because it's a fantastic value. 255RMB for all you can...

"This place is an oasis in Beijing. Renowned for its Sunday brunch (which you need to book a week in advance to guarantee a table) and stunning gardens. Great for private functions or for a romantic dinner. A bit out of town so allow 45-60 minutes travel time from downtown especially at peak traffic times. Children will love the gardens....

"This restaurant is in an old, large country house and retains its charm.

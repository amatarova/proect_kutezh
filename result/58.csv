"I was most impressed by the wonderful staff of this hotel. we were immediately greeted by staff members and escorted inside. the concierge staff was wonderful and many spoke very good English, which for us, was a plus as our Chinese is limited to ""thank you""--XIE XIE!. The staff was pleasant and wanted to please. The food was good, but...

"We had Italian after a week of local food and this was definitely a hit. We shared portions of Ragu, Tortini and both were amazing. We also had a Prime Rib to share which I must compliment was done to perfection. Desert was Tiramisu and one other (which I have forgotten) but they were also fantastic. Service staff were super!...

"This restaurant is located in the Ritz and is very nice. It has a pleasant atmosphere and great service. Being from the U.S. I am always nervous in foreign restaurants in regards to the meat quality. I had the pasta with meat sauce on the recommendation of the general manager and I was delicious. It came with a starter of...

"This is an expensive restaurant. While the room prices of Ritzs and 4Seasons in China are a relative bargain in the context of major cities of the world, this restuarant is expensive relative to the price of the room. The above is just for context. I ate at Cepe two nights in a row, and spent about 6 hours total...

"Having spent the last week travelling around Asia due to work, this was the nicest meal that we have had so far. The restaurant isn't big so would certainly recommend that you book your table in advance. The decor tries to exude exclusivity and does I think but in a Chinese way (a good copy!). The menu is varied with...

"This is the Italian restaurant within the Ritz Carlton Financial Street, Beijing. It's a stylish restaurant with a nice menu. The food however is not so memorable. If it were not promoted as such a high end restaurant, I'd rate in more favourably, but in the end the food and pricing are not aligned. But I guess what can be...

"The service was attentive yet odd. The food was good, but not terribly memorable. What was most shocking was the fact that a chunk of mirror came crashing down in the midst of dinner just a few feet from our table. Had someone been standing under the mirror, it could have been fatal. What actually made up for the dinner...

"Is it worth $75 to $150 per person to eat such exquisite food in such luxurious surroundings? Certainly once in a lifetime. Attentive wait staff and servers made us feel like royalty. The amuse-bouches were themselves amazing. The menu was wonderful and the food better than expected. Even as Americans we were treated super nicely.

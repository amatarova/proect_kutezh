"With this being one of the oldest (chain) duck restaurants in Beijing you can certainly be sure they are experts at what they do. Its been established and doing what they do since the 15th century possibly earlier. We arrived late in the evening very near to closing time and they were still very welcoming, polite and pleasant. The food...

"One of many good duck restaurants in the area, and possibly the best if you are after a leaner but still yummy meal. Your waiter even gives you a demo of how to fill your pancake, which is a nice touch!","5 из 5 кружков","021701EA6ECF4AE314E07686AE4EC160","Отзыв написан 8 мая 2016"

"For me the best place to eat roast duck around Qiamen. The place is huge with several floors and even private rooms. Service is a must, the duck is cut in front of the customer. The flower set is my favorite. I also love the skin with sugar.","5 из 5 кружков","38EB6C3AEB53399F5EDDBD46CE4BCFE4","Отзыв написан 14 января 2016"

"After visiting a few other Beijing duck restaurants this sails in as a must experience meal. The duck they serve is amazing, there is plenty of other things to chose from as well, but you want the duck, everything else should be considered a bonus. The menu is in both Chinese and English and has pictures of pretty much everything....

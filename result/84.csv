"Whilst service was not very good and one dish (spicy noodle soup) rather tasteless, we did enjoy or lunch. Will we go back? Probably not as there are many great Yunnan restaurants in Beijing (such as the superb Dali Courtyard).","3 из 5 кружков","9B7F583A4048942CEAD0FEFD727343EF","Отзыв написан 28 января 2017"
"The decoration may not please everybody with the walls and ceilings in raw concrete but the food is just excellent. Flavours of herbs, citruses and fruits are in every dish which will give you an unexpected surprise as the gilled fish which looks just average but tastes fantastic.

"We were a party of six, and ordered 15 different dishes that were all excellent - certainly a new take on traditional dishes. Service was nice and more or less prompt. No English was spoken, but you can still point, so no problem. The fancy menu had only few notes in English, but, in good old fashion of Chinese restaurants,...

"This place is a nice place to visit for friends and colleagues, price is still mid range and need to book during busy days. Try the pineapple rice, goat cheese, potato balls and fried egg with jasmine. Good ambience and once done, you could also have some desserts and cafe just a few shops down.","4 из 5 кружков","52DACADFEA924DB66D77ED23A3749853","Отзыв написан 11 сентября 2016"
"Visited In & Out for dinner with colleagues and some business partners and had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. We ordered a range of Yunnan style fish, beef, chicken, vegetable and rice dishes and shared them in the usual 'chew & chat' style. It was a casual evening with good food and company that went for over 3 hours. I found...

However, one of the times I visited I was disturbed to use the washroom at the same time as one of the servers only to observe them leaving without washing their hands!

"We were recommended to try In & Out by a friend. Upon searching, we found various locations spread around Sanlitun. We decided to choose the one nearest to us...in the Sanlitun neighborhood by the Liangma river adjacent to the Italian Panini Cafe.... Unfortunately I dont have the exact address of this branch.. Anyway, we walked in at 8pm and had...

"My companion and I were thrilled with this recommendation from our hotel. After a few uncomfortable moments trying to communicate with a server who did not have good English, since our Mandarin is poor, we were connected with a delightful server who made us very comfortable and served up some terrific Yunan food. It was spicy, flavorful, and fresh. They...

"Delicious and very tasty cuisine. If you fancy the colourful and deliciously spiced exotic food from Southern Chinese Yunnan province In & Out is a good choice right in the middle of Beijing's Sanlitun embassy area.

Not only was it tasty, but...

"The food is excellent, spicy but not overly so. Be careful of the sweet rice wine; it's tastey but it will sneak up on you. Sometimes has musicians playing typical folk songs from Yunnan.

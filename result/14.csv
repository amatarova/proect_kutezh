"We ate here whilst staying at the hotel. We had a nice Italian meal (Risotto and Pizza).

The stay were very helpful - our baby is gluten free and they were happy to cook the gluten free pasta (but didn't have any there already) we had taken with us and to make a sauce for him. They even brought gluten free bread to begin.","4 из 5 кружков","E2CAA507BF4A84814C0853A09C102B0E","21 февраля 2017"
"Fratelli Fresh is one of my favorite restaurants in Beijing.
If you are looking for authentic intalian food, Fratelli Fresh is the place to go.
Chef Stefano will make sure that you enjoy your meal.

"Chef Stefano brings his energy and sharp culinary skills to the restaurant every night. I have had several great meals here. From the pizza to the pasta to the seafood everything is done very well and Chef is happy to accommodate special requests.

"I am sorry for this Late review because I just returned to the U.S. I was in Asia for business and was in Beijing, China. I stayed at the Renaissance Beijing Capital Hotel. I went to the Italian restaurant in the hotel named, Fratelli. I have been to many Italian restaurants all over the world but this place is by far one of the best due to the excellent Italian dishes prepared by Chef Stefano Balduccio. Chef Stefano does not only create delicious meals but is very personable who cares about how his guests enjoy his wonderful meals as well. I highly recommend anyone visiting Beijing to go visit Chef Stefano at Fratelli in the Renaissance Beijing Capital Hotel. Best Italian food!! 5 stars!
Tell him, Lawrence sent you. : )","5 из 5 кружков","89DB9380B4D62D9E05AD271E5602947B","Отзыв написан 5 января 2017"
"Spent some time in Bejing over the Thanksgiving Holiday. First time away from the USA during Thanksgiving. Had a late arrival and stayed at the Beijing Capital Renaissance Hotel. Had some special request (had a late night after hour meal prepared and sent to my room) and Chef Stefano Balducci at Fratellie Fresh was very accommodating. If visiting Beijing, and want a great atmosphere and great Italian food- Fratellie Fresh is a definite place to visit. Didn't miss USA Thanksgiving at all!","5 из 5 кружков","00848CA0ECB71C4520D84B29CD3B0D1E","Отзыв написан 3 января 2017"
"Fratelli Fresh is an innovative yet traditional Italian restaurant. You can find the international atmosphere of a multicultural Beijing, and also the very genuine taste of traditional Italian cuisine, with well-calibrated genuine ingredients in exquisite essential yet never ordinary dishes. I have to mention the amusing chef Stefano Balduccio's kind and warm welcome, that was part of our evening delight there. He takes care personally of all the dishes and even explained to us some cooking recommendations!","5 из 5 кружков","7FD98E9DC62135EBDD9C39838688F063","Отзыв написан 2 января 2017"

"We had just finished a long day in Beijing and took our kids on a 2-hour walk on the Great Wall. It was our son's birthday and he said he wanted Italian so we went to Trip Advisor and decided on Fratelli Fresh. Within a few minutes of arriving the Chef came by our table and we began asking about the menu. He spent several minutes talking to us and helped us choose the dishes based on what everyone wanted.

The bread came out and was AMAZING- hands down the best balsamic vinegar we have had in a long time! Everything was great and cooked to perfection. The pizza was great- a good blend between thin and thick crust.

This is definitely worth a stop if you want a good place for dinner. Thanks for the warm hospitality!!!!","5 из 5 кружков","8B42E68C894485AD854F35D5141A8D9E","Отзыв написан 19 декабря 2016"
"Best Italian food I have had in Beijing since moving here from Michigan. Friday night walked in with no reservations and got a nice quiet booth for my wife and I. My wife ordered a salad and I had the risotto paired with a nice house wine. Nothing fancy or over the top. First the bread came with a wonderful balsamic and oil side. Excellent. The balsamic was thick and almost chocolate like. Bread was crusty on the outside with a fluffy center. All the better to soak up either the butter or the delicious oil and vinegar. Salad came and was very good and the risotto was excellent. Creamy and homemade with savory mushrooms. So the meal was excellent! Great food, carefully prepared and presented.
However, what makes this even better is that the Chef and owner, Stefano visits each table at some point throughout the meal. He is a big Italian gentlemen with a smile and laugh to match his size. This is a small thing, but it really makes for a nice dinning experience. We have recommended Fratelli Fresh to at least 20 people already here in Beijing and we are looking forward to making this one of our go to spots for friends and family.","5 из 5 кружков","D5AD9424385FAF61F8B2067FDB2DA197","Отзыв написан 12 декабря 2016"
"I'm not sure I'm reviewing the correct Fratelli's. I had dinner at the Wine Bar and Restaurant not the little cafe. Anyway, I was early for my dinner...first one in for the night. I don't like a heavy dinner so opted for a bread board, a glass of sparkling wine and the best fish soup I've ever had. So rich and brimming with sea delights. There was a slight kick to the tomato based broth. Stefano, the chef, came over and we chatted for a bit. I live outside of Beijing, but will be back for sure for another perfect weekend away.","5 из 5 кружков","1E06684B2317653DCBD8C75A3CDC55C3","Отзыв написан 4 декабря 2016"
"We recently had dinner at Fratellifresh and it was super experience and far exceeded our expectations. The main reasons why we chose to eat at Fratellifresh, Italian restaurant was because, we knew the food was good and I was home sick for some great Italian home cooking after being on the road in China for the previous 2 weeks. Without question Stefano, the head chef for the Marriott Renaissance Capital in Beijing and his team did better than good, the food was outstanding!
The atmosphere was festive and the service was great. No waiting and everyone was extremely responsive as Stefano demonstrated by example what service, quality and hospitality is and the team absolutely followed based on his leader led example.
The host asked us where we would like to sit and we chose a booth in the back near the cooking area to enjoy the view of the preparation process. The restaurant is very well decorated and very well maintain, organized with a focus on the client’s comfort and sense of being welcomed.
The attentiveness of the waitress (made us feel like we were her only table however she had multiple tables to deal with). As we finished dinner, Brian one of the Marriott’s management advised us that since I was a Marriott gold/platinum we would also get a 30% discount which was very pleasant surprise and therefore the price, value for our dining experience was off the chart for a great, great value for a dining event.
I strongly recommend when staying at the Marriott Renaissance Capital in Beijing or if you’re in the Capital area to try the Fratellifresh Italian Restaurant.
I really want to give a shout out to Stefano and his team as well as Brian for really doing a great job. I don’t do reviews often but this was so exceptional and so deserving I had to submit these comments.
Hope everyone takes the opportunity to visit the Marriott Renaissance Capital Beijing and for sure have dinner in Stefano’s great restaurant. Bon Appetit!","5 из 5 кружков","67E5A4FA6A54B3CC6CC09B3B2C0B14AC","Отзыв написан 23 октября 2016"
"By far the best Italian restaurant in Beijing and doubtless one of the best western restaurants in town generally.
My wife and me ( German citizenships living in Beijing for approx 2.5 years ) have been at Fratelli Fresh for a couple of times and it<U+00B4>s always been amazing.
Italian Chef Stefano ensures that the food ( doesn't matter if you eat the handmade pasta, the authentic pizza or one of the delicious desserts ) is simply outstanding, however also the service is always doing an outstanding job ( especially Andy is probably one of the best service staff you can find in town - his passion & service is just impressive )
Hence, there's absolutley nothing you could complain about when eating at Fratelli Fresh!","5 из 5 кружков","4A4159ECC69242BDBA2860EF9E00ED18","Отзыв написан 22 октября 2016"
"It is always a pleasure to return time and time again to this great Italian restaurant.

I come from Europe but I have been living in Beijing for 4 years, so when i want my Italian fix, I always come here.
Both Brian (restaurant manager) and Stefano (Italian Chef extraordinaire) will take good care of you.
If something is not in the menu, the chef can prepare it for you.

Also, you should ask the chef to prepare his signature caffe
Latte......the best!



Enjoy your next meal there, and the great selection of wines as well.

"I'm half Italian so I love Italian Food and I always like to eat Italian food, even when away from home, as a discerning traveler, I like to eat in really good Italian Restaurants around the Globe. The one thing that amaze me every time I come back at Fratelli Fresh, is that I feel like if I'm back home at my Family House where our personal Chef is prepping great meals for us everyday. This is what is happening when you are walking through the door of Fratelli, Stefano the Master Chef of the Restaurant, welcomes you and I don't even need to look at the Menu, I just ask him: ""Sfefano what are you going to cook for me tonight?"", and then you see his eyes get bright as he start telling you all the fresh pasta dishes the appetizers, the meat and fish he can prep for you. To me this is priceless, so when you go there. please let yourself indulge by Stefano many temptations and enjoy his culinary ride.","5 из 5 кружков","E83EA30902174B57F3D7CA1AF4EBBD33","Отзыв написан 1 октября 2016"

"Had several dishes here and all were nice. Nonetheless, was terribly shocked to see that a bottle of water was priced at 89RM which was far more than 2 of our dishes in a country where water is not expensive. Absolute rip off considering it is a hotel restaurant.

"Stayed at the renaissance and this is the western restaurant of the hotel. Specialising in Italian, there is the usual pasta and pizza but we opted for the fiorentina steak. It was good. The wine we ordered was out of stock and they offered a more expensive one.

"This is a normal Italian restaurant in Beijing. As it is located in the Marriott, maybe because it is more expensive than other Italian restaurants in Beijing. We were several friends there, took very common Italian meals as lasagna for example and even pizza. They are ok, but nothing special. The service is also quite ok, I would say friendly staff.","3 из 5 кружков","69B6F2EA0CA4FA56B7211BEEB56D7F75","Отзыв написан 10 июля 2016"

"What a wonderful experience! This is one of the best places I have ever eaten. The ambiance is excellent, the aroma sublime, the service impeccable and the food, Bella Bella!! Chef Stefano makes this a great personal experience. With six business guests at dinner, Asian and American, he made this a wonderful experience. Suggesting the wine, personalizing the menu during the ordering, cracking some jokes and keeping the staff hopping Chef Stefano made this a memorable experience. It was so nice we stayed well into the evening enjoying the excellent red wines and some nice petite desserts. Really an exceptional experience. A must visit for high end Italian food in Beijing!

"Have eaten at a number of Pizza restaurants in Beijing and this one was as good as any. Location is a bit off the beaten path and the restaurant feels a little like a coffee shop. However Pizza was thin cust with a tasty tomato sauce, and the one pasta we tried was perfectly cooked and obviously made in house. Wine selection is somewhat limited and a number of the bottles on the list were not available. Overall a good dining experience, a great place to come with friends but probably not a place to take business clients. On a different note our server Caroline was amazing, very friendly and attentive. She spoke perfect English and was as engaging as any server in a good restaurant in the US.","4 из 5 кружков","BC5D714AF4BF8D00F75F2F191DABC4D9","Отзыв написан 21 апреля 2016"
"TripAdvisor reviews led my wife and three children here for dinner. We've been eating Chinese cuisine for the entire vacation so decided to treat the family with a nice (and quiet) dining experience. This restaurant delivered everything we needed on that night.

It was chic and fancy, but yet inviting and comfortable. The background music was relaxing. Staff were polite and attentive. The food, well, the result spoke for themselves. We ordered garlic bread, spaghetti bolognese, ravioli, linguine cabonara , 2 pizzas, gelatos and fondant, and nothing went to waste. The glass of Italian red wine complimented the meals. The price was very reasonable.

The conversation on the table, with three children, suddenly turned sophisticated and civilised during the night. Thank you Fratelli Fresh :-)","5 из 5 кружков","E3BE3A86F7FA3788F02E32D8C7BE248C","Отзыв написан 19 апреля 2016"
"My brother and I had a fantastic evening last night chez Fratelli.

The carbonara and pizza were delicious. Nothing was rushed which is nice as it enhances the entire experience.

The real highlight was the legendary Brian as he made dealing with Stefano bearable. Okay okay, just kidding. They were both great conversationalists who played off each other perfectly! We were impressed they could keep up with our banter.

We definitely recommend Fratelli to others. Thank you, Brian and Stefano!

"We went here as part of restaurant week.

Amazing experience from the first to the last minute.

Great, friendly and informative staff, attentive, but not overwhelming.

We were sat near the kitchen, which added great atmosphere to our meal. It was great to see all of the hard work and dedication happening and to experience the thrill of the kitchen.

Starter- scallops- simply divine. Soft and tender, the balsamic vinegar was the best I’ve ever tasted. A fresh, crisp, clean tasting salad.

Rissotto- cooked to perfection, veal which had a slight smokiness to … I usually shove my food down my mouth as quickly as I can but the food was so good it made me slow down and savour every last mouthful.

The dessert was simply outstanding.

Generous portions, but not too much.

The staff were great, as mentioned. It was a great touch when the chef came round during each of our courses to see if we were enjoying the food. He was clearly passionate and dedicated to his craft.

The restaurant was large and well equipped but maintained a personal intimate ambience.

Easily the best meal I’ve had in Beijing… possibly the best meal I’ve ever had anywhere- I cannot recommend highly enough.","5 из 5 кружков","39729E7D348BD0230D9FF94DC45C9A09","Отзыв написан 13 марта 2016"

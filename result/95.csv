Nice environment, not too large so a nice number of people, not noisy. Food taste very...

"The team does a great job supporting a business dinner in a private room. I can't speak to having a dinner in the open space dining area. A good wine list. If you are staying in the hotel then it is even better.","5 из 5 кружков","BC0E7CC4D7B9E35E0BAD16D474F8411F","ќтзыв написан 11 декабр€ 2013"

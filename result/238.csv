"Located on the 4th floor of the upscale China Mall, DaDong maybe the best restaurant you can find in the city for Peking Duck. We were a party of three that showed up without a reservation which resulted in a 40 minute wait, but were willing to wait as we had heard so much about this place. We were offered...

"Although it was Valentine's day, our hotel concierge managed to persuade DaDong to accommodate us (3). Arrived at 8.10 as agreed and were seated at the bar for a short time and attended by wine waiter. After 10 minutes table ready, duck, condiments and pancakes arrived promptly, and ordered vegetables shortly after. Food very good, complementary kumquats and toffee apples...

"Not just the roast Peking Duck, all the dishes were artistically presented! I had a terrific time admiring the food and savouring them slowly. Goose liver presented as delicate berries the size of the Arbutus berry! Yummy! Duck's intestines looking like twist ties! Ymmy! Ducks' tongues to nibble on while having a business conversation! Yummy1 Oh so many! You'll have...

"The local team took us here fro a treat to say thank your helping with a workshop at the office in Beijing - it was a great restaurant for a business group given the private dining rooms. The staff were great and the surroundings fine, but the star of the show was certainly the food - particularly the Sunflower Chicken...

"We were delighted to learn a new location had opened up across the street from the JW Marriott. It was a hip spot with clever design elements. Without reservations we had a 20 minute wait which was the perfect amount of time to grab a cocktail at the bar. We picked the duck that was presented tableside along with several...

"What's the first dish that comes to mind when Beijing is mentioned? Roast duck for sure! The brand <U+5927><U+61C2> (Da Dong) has branched into more western-style cuisine, by adding duck meat in their burgers. Although the burger itself doesn't remind you of the infamous dish, the duck meat accompanied with salad most definitely does. If you're in the area, definitely...

"This review is for the fast food style DaDong at CCP. It isn't a full review because we dropped in right after they closed. The waitress's was kind enough to seat us even tho it was obvious the restaurant was closed but they only had one item on the menu available for us. We had the duck leg on salad...

"Part of Rosewood hotel, Red bowl is a well designed restaurant, extremely trendy for a hot pot restaurant.. decor and ambiance is cool.. However that doesn't really add anything special to the dining experience of what a hot pot restaurant is.. specially when this highly reflects on the prices of their menus / ingredients. All sauces, beverages, food condiments (I'm...

"New friends insisted we needed to have a Hot Pot experience, and this restaurant attached to the Rosewood Hotel did not disappoint. The actual ""hot pot"" for our table had two chambers: one for cooking in traditional broth, the other for an oil-and-peppers base that looked way too dangerous for anything except rocket fuel. Plates full of raw stuff to...

"The most trendy Hot Pot place I have been. Great quality of food, attentive service. Also draft beer available from breweries in Beijing like Slow Boat. Great concept and an unusual hot pot restaurant.","4 из 5 кружков","646DD783E1AA906AF859D15E00BEA768","Отзыв написан 21 апреля 2016"
"Red Bowl delivers a pretty decent hot pot in very stylish surroundings. The hot pot itself is pretty good- it delivers decent flavor, similar to the standard bearer in the city (Hai di Lao), the mushroom hotpot is quite good, as is the standard ma la. The quality of the meats are quite good with nicely marbled short rib and...

"If you want to feel cool whilst having hot pot then try Red Bowl. This place felt uber trendy - great cocktails served in a host of different ways - and the music made me feel like I was at Buddha Bar or something. The food itself was pretty good although probably not the best hot pot I've ever had....

"A couple of colleagues took me to Red Bowl for hot pot tonight and I was pretty blown away by how trendy and fancy it looked. Presentation of all the food was lovely and the soup was very tasty! There were a host of different soups you could choose from. The only thing I was probably disappointed in was the...

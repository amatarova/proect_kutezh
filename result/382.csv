"We really enjoyed the new Jing. Highly recommended. The Peninsula Hotel is fully renovated in 2016/2017 and amazing.","5 из 5 кружков","F6C58D01A2B5E981D140E0E07EFA37F3","Отзыв написан 14 января 2017"
"Staying at the hotel, we were here daily for breakfast and also used it for drinks with clients and dinner. Each time, the staff was wonderful and accommodating. Remembered our preferences and orders from the times before. It's a little brightly lit and lacks ambiance for dinner, but the food was excellent, fresh and not too heavy.","5 из 5 кружков","70DAE5F5BE6405B99DE5FCCC1A41F6F8","Отзыв написан 8 января 2017"
"Coffee shop related to Peninsula Hotel so I came here many times - the waitress remembered what was my preferred drinks and habits and could call me by name. Excellent service! First day we all went out at the same time, second day they gave us our bill immediately so no need to wait! Wonderful! Buffet breakfast was good but...

"This is a mixed review. Food delicious, service almost impeccable. Almost. But I recommend the restaurant because overall I enjoyed the experience. We had arrived on foot, locating the Peninsula Hotel with difficulty because the name on the building, although prominent at night when lit up, is virtually invisible in the daytime. It would have been easy to find, however,...

"We are traveling in a group of 12. Some are very picky eaters. This restaurant provides buffets that will please everyone. The prices are very high but the food is of good quality and you on't get sick.","4 из 5 кружков","A8FAAABB14A3316B79C0A14EE47A4798","Отзыв написан 18 июня 2013"
"Even though most of their English was limited it was easy to get what you wanted or have questions answered. The breakfast buffet has a combination of Chinese and Western crusine that was pretty good. We did eat here one night for supper and ordered off the menu. We had the caprese salad and scallops for starter and both were...

"Very nice restaurant , part of a very nice hotel ( The Peninsula) but still very expensive . I know what you are thinking if you stay in this grade of hotel then the restaurants will be expensive. BUT the food is too expensive for what you get and the beer prices are a joke. The beer is brewed locally...

"Because it's just plain average. And pricey. Too few cooked vegetable offerings, barely any protein offerings with the hot pot, gross looking soup, 1 scallop tasted good, the other I had to spit out, improper utensils for the crab claws so impossible to get the meat out, greasy stir fry dishes, and so-so deserts. The a la cart offerings were...

"Never knew there is a restaurant hidden downstairs at Peninsula, great place with great buffet. Not cheap but good choice when hanging out with friend. Buffet dinner with as many choice as you can imagine, and all cooked in a-la-carte quality! I don't eat lobster, but that might be a must-eat choice for lobster fans. Excellent service also can't miss!","5 из 5 кружков","60BE0049100AD8246570A084741E9806","Отзыв написан 29 ноября 2011"

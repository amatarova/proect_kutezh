"We would never have realised this is a vegetarian restaurant without trip advisor. Many of the reviews were off putting as they raved about the mock meat which we really dislike. But we did manage to put together a very good meal and it was both cheap and delicious","4 из 5 кружков","67501FF0000341CA37ECE765E6F4F00D","Отзыв написан 8 октября 2016"
"Great for vegetarians and vegans. No questions about whether something is vegetarian but maybe cooked in chicken broth. No animal fat or meat in any direction. I am not a vegetarian but enjoyed the meal. Husband is vegetarian and enjoyed it more. Creative uses of soy products in all manner of shapes, sizes and textures make for some interesting mock...

"My brother and I eat a vegan diet and we discovered that this eatery was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel. We arrived a little later than we would have liked (20 mins to closing time) and staff accommodated us. We ordered the spicy potatoes, the Sichuan mushroom dish and two portions of rice between us. We were...

"We visited this restaurant with our daughter who is a committed vegetarian. She is working in China and experiences real difficulty in sourcing vegetarian options on a menu. Virtually all the dishes on offer were forms of ""mock meat"". The food was well presented and enjoyable. Total bill for three including drinks was 255 yuan. Staff were very pleasant and...

"My Chinese colleagues took us here for an extensive meal here, 19 dishes in total. There were 2 dozen of us. Nearly all dishes had a 'meat' name, such as vegetarian duck, ham, eel, mutton, fish, etc. The food was beautifully presented and tasted great. If you did not know it was a vegetarian restaurant you could almost believe you...

"The food was quite all right, the menu is nice, with acceptable English translations and lots of photos. We spent roughly RMB 60 per person. The staff looked a bit bored and were not overly helpful, but the food arrived pretty soon and was really quite good. They set up Buddha statues which is good, but I think they should...

"Food: 4/5. There were some creative and interesting dishes. Tasty and flavorful. Good presentation. Can't go wrong with the fake meat dishes. However, pass on the vegetable buns and dumplings, the fillings were bland. They should change to chive or cabbage filling instead. Service: 4/5. Friendly and fast. Location: 3/5. Nothing special. Ambience: 4/5. Nice, clean and tastefully decorated. Good...

"Lots of ""fake meat"" menu options. Food was good but not great. Traditional Chinese ambiance. Food was somewhat similar to other vege dishes at other restaurants.","3 из 5 кружков","0CBCEE22F4F0A01604259FBD1275C7A5","Отзыв написан 26 октября 2014"
"The food was very good. The staff was nice but had limited English so ordering was based on pictures in the menu. Presentation was very good as well. A bit on the pricey side though, but good if you want a nice dinner.","4 из 5 кружков","80F0F41C23F8458BAEC6D3F8F97ECD98","Отзыв написан 5 января 2014"

"I had visited the place some...25 years ago. Was magical! Since then I truly became vegetarian and insisted heavily to visit the place with my fellow colleagues. Well, the old place had much more ""charm""' at least as far as I can remember! We decided to go for the full ""trial"" with a ""suite of some 15/20 dishes"" rather than...

"I first ate in Gongdelin about 20 years ago in the old location when they had dishes such as ""leopards footprints in the snow"" and ""sunlight singes the snow capped mountains"" and just loved it. I re-discovered it recently by accident but was sooo please to do so. It is much more modern in the new location opposite the Capital...

"My wife and I had been to the Shanghai Gongdelin and wanted to try this one, so we took our son and his wife there for lunch. The location and interior are not as nice as the Shanghai outlet, but the food is just as good. The menu is extensive, with photos of every dish so you can order by...

"This is a nice vegetarian restaurant located not far away from the Chongwenmen Station. Even if you never want to be a vegetarian, this restaurant will definitely add good impressions to your trip in Beijing. The service is quite good as well. Average RMB$100.00 to RMB$150.00 per person.","4 из 5 кружков","86A0E343A1657E7294E960359833EEE0","Отзыв написан 21 февраля 2013"

"Food was well prepared and tasty, considering that this is a vegetarian outlet, where meat is not used to enhance the flavour of the dishes. There were quite a good number of dishes, with different tastes. I don't know the prices though since our tour guide took us there and the meal was part of our tour package.","4 из 5 кружков","EFB7D270867C8A90BFE8DEE8A67911F5","Отзыв написан 14 июня 2012"
"This vegetarian restaraunt is a 15 min walk from the front gate of the Forbiden Palace or a 40 min walk for the back gate if you know where you are going. The establishment is well designed and the staff are quite friendly. I am not sure if any of them speak English but not to worry plenty of pictures...

"During our China group tour in September 2016,we had a lunch there. It was a tasty buffet. Variety was less as compared to other lunch & dinners. Service need improvement.

"The location of the restaurant is not very easy to find. There were not many people but the size of the restaurant was huge. Loved the ambience. Food was decent, not overpowering but tasty and hearty North Indian cuisine. We had the paneer tikka and peanut masala as starters. The mocktails were served chilled and were decent. Main course of...

"Arguably one of the finest restaurants outside India. No, they are not one of those high-end, expensive UK or US Indian curry restaurants. The most Indian friendly restaurant outside the country. Good interior, good Indian delicacies are amalgamated with an amazingly sweet hosting by the staff. If you are looking for something better than just food and ambiance then you...

"I was carving for Indian food and would not compromise on taste. My local Chinese friend suggested this hotel, I was not sure if it will meet my expectations. I thought it would be some Chinese Indian type like our Indian Chinese :)... The ambiance was great, Indian style and the staff were also Indians. This made me feel good....

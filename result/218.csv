"Sunday-sized appetite right next to great main shopping area. They ha e me a basket for my bag, and they are nice. The ice cream is mostly based off of Chinese culture inspired flavor a such as rice, tea, bubble tea and grass.","5 из 5 кружков","5470D050D81A80C6986F6DD3991B244B","Отзыв написан 26 июня 2016"

"we ran into this place by accident and had to try it since it voted one of the top 10 desserts in the world by CNN. it was quite impressive once the desserts arrived - the flavored shaved ice was like nothing i had ever seen before and the flavor was really good. we had the coffee and the boba...

"We have been here twice. This is suppose to be an ice dessert chain from Taiwan. We ordered the mung bean ice. Very good! We have also tried the mango ice( this is what they are famous for) and the milk tea ice. Of the three, mung bean and mango are definitely better than the milk tea. Great dessert for...

"Interesting mixture of fruity and milky flavors (milky tea and coffee shaved ice are the best flavors, totally recommended). A little expensive for ""flavored ice"" but and interesting experience nonetheless. Fruit sorbet is great, rich natural flavor and ice will delight your palate. This is not Italian gelato, so don't expect the same. Recommended for your couples or ice cream...

"This is place is advertised all over the shopping center as the number 10 dessert place in the world and for around US$10 you get a a mango shaved ice cream with real mangos and cream, good indeed but not even close to my top 100 yet alone 10. The serving is huge so if you must have it share...

"If you want Shave ICE with a twist this is your place. Like the other locations in Taipei and Japan, ICE Monster does it again in Beijing! The taste is indescribably GREAT and one desert is certainly enough for two. It's worth a stop to check it out if you are in the Beijing Wafujing area!","5 из 5 кружков","B8F4B6627318EBF2FF71C757B4801038","Отзыв написан 3 августа 2015"

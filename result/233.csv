"Visited this restaurant/bar recently with friends and was very disappointed. Have enjoyed previous visits but not this time singly because of lackluster service. There were 3 waiting staff and 3 bar staff but we had to wait for at least 15 minutes for our 2nd ordered beer as staff were too busy looking at phones or mixing cocktails whilst there...

"I've been here a few times and enjoyed the overall quirky Euro cafe vibe. The service can be patchy and the food is OK but it great. My most recent visit did not go so well simply because no one served us. And even after chatting to the western owner guy, after another 15 minutes of waiting and looking for...

"Tucked away in the old traditional Hutongs of Beijing you can find this lovely restaurant and bar. Its located not far from the Bell Tower. Owned and operated by french people. The food is really delicious. The attention given to serve it in a beautiful way is worthwhile mentioning, so is the personal attention. The 'price performance ratio' is very...

"Modernista is in a traditional hutong, in the Bell Tower area and has a restaurant, nextdoor to a bar. They have the same name, but their own door. In the restaurant we first had some drink and tapas, and afterwards dinner and dessert. The food looked wonderful, was well prepared and delicious. The manager and his staff were taking care...

"I was so impressed by the European food, amazing and divine. The range of drinks!!! is...... can't find a word for it unbelievable. I was speechless at their range of rums. Cocktails, well you have to go and try it by yourself, it's the place to stop and have a good time. They also organise a variety of events during...

"What more could you want from a hutong bar? Hot chocolate and churros, absinthe, Spanish tapas, great music and lots of dancing. Don't miss its themed nights either.","5 из 5 кружков","A2EA41F67F49733C9B6EA1688A891CAA","Отзыв написан 23 марта 2016"
"This bar is slightly ""higher-class"" than what I am used to, but it has a very chill and welcoming vibe. Mostly foreigners and the Chinese that go are usually the type that have studied abroad in america or England. Friday nights tend to be the best; they usually have a great live band that is great to rock out to!...

"Modernista was fairly recently renovated into two distinct parts - a restaurant and sit down bar area on one side and a live music venue on the other. I never really visited Modernista in the evening before they renovated it. However, on day time visits I always liked the feel of the place. I would say since the changes it's...

"I have had late night drinks and Sunday brunch at Modernista. I love the speakeasy style drinks, and especially appreciate the creativity of the bartender and the large, square ice cubes. The waiters are really great, and remember you after you have come a few times. When the weather is nice it is lovely to sit in one of the...

"Hugely popular with Beijing expats, this bar is often crowded in the evenings, especially on weekends. The food is not really worth it, but it has good, cheap drinks (including some great hot chocolate that works wonders to warm you up during Beijing's harsh winters) and a cool international atmosphere. It often has live music and other events. The staff...

"We were here on our hutong exploration tour, and after Mai, this was a slight disappointment. The food except for the Tuna salad was not very good, but cocktails were okay even if pricey. While we were there, there was a drawing class with a model and afterwards the barman (owner?) started to sing. For two cocktails and two tapas...

"We visited on a Wednesday night when the Modernista has swing dancing. it's free, the live music was great (the Hot Club of Beijing), and about a dozen people showed up first for lessons and then for dancing. that's all that would fit - it's a smallish place, like most in the hutong. Like the set of Cheers, one got...

"This has been my favorite dim sum restaurant in Asia. Compared to the Din Tai Fungs in other countries (Hong Kong/Singapore), the one in Beijing is on the cheaper side so I would recommend going if in the city (around $15 USD and you will be really full). There are plenty of locations and the food did not disappoint. I recommend the xiao long bao and eggplant. Absolutely delicious. I wish I had came with a larger group so that we could have ordered even more from the menu. Regardless, great service and great food!","5 из 5 кружков","5EB6CAB074796D6F7F75780860CDEC33","4 марта 2017"
"The place is clean, run efficiently, and serves good dim sum at a reasonable price. The menu is somewhat difficult in its lay out, but helpful. Service is swift. The various dim sum were cooked perfectly, but is not very much better than other good dim sum offerings and the restaurant is easily outcooked by other good domestic restaurants.","4 из 5 кружков","58766AC30AD7D07D704DDC8C17A1977F","28 февраля 2017"
"This place was awesome! The restaurant was impeccably clean with friendly staff and delicious food. We tried 3 different types of dumplings, our favorite being the specialty pork, wonton soup and the asparagus with shrimp. All of it was sooooo good and reasonably priced.

Also, the staff was so very friendly from start to finish. Multiple servers helped us throughout our visit and everyone was polite and smiling. When leaving, the manager wished a good evening with a warm smile.

If in Beijing, definitely take the time to stop here... you won't be sorry!","5 из 5 кружков","D665E63BE0FEA5866007D0D474C62328","27 февраля 2017"

"I came here with some friends who highly recommended it. It's very casual, but the food is really good. I just ate whatever came in front of me, but was fun to share food which was so yummy. I think it's fun to come as a group! Noodle was great too.","5 из 5 кружков","22CD1154C1D0B37540A3DAD103A5ED1F","Отзыв написан 19 января 2017"

"The restaurants owned by Ding Tai Fung company have the same clean setting and atmosphere. The food in all locations is the same not very elaborated but palatable. The menu is focused on different type of dumplings which are light and tasty, in fact it appeals to Chinese and foreign customers.","4 из 5 кружков","78E04D9D9CB6C6D5602AC486737A574F","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2016"

"We decided to try this place as it was the only restaurant selling Chinese food that wasn't packed or didn't have a crazy hours wait, and it was our last meal before we left China so wanted it to be a good one but we were VERY disappointed. Firstly the menu looks amazing, had what we were both craving, dumplings is a must and I do admit are delish but we also wanted duck and a vegetable dish and were told that there was none left, sold out, it was only 730-8pm we were so disappointed but we committed to this restaurant so tried what else they had to offer. To be honest the food is AVERAGE, the only good dish was the dumplings, but what made it worse was after we got all our dishes about 30mins later the table next to us got duck! WHAT THE! The waitress couldn't explain and got her manager and it was advised 'they were cooking it' which didn't help at all, so just so you know, if they say it's SOLD out! They are LYING!","2 из 5 кружков","4F0F25CD2A6765B12997B8EE6C9308A8","Отзыв написан 9 ноября 2016"

"We came here 2 times during our stay in Beijing. This restaurant is just located nearby our hotel. The service was good and prompt. The dumplings, noodles and fried rice were excellent. The price is kinda on the high side but it worth the money.","4 из 5 кружков","E3B74C73600278DAC3B71574575325B5","Отзыв написан 30 октября 2016"
"Really excellent soup dumplings. Cab driver had major problems finding the place, had to ask 5 different people. You'll have a great meal here, but it's a chain, not unique to Beijing - so you'll lose out on local authenticity.","5 из 5 кружков","ADAEC8C11C55F5E5FB5EAAA83B22CCDC","Отзыв написан 27 октября 2016"
"Go at least once a visit for the most consistent dumplings in China. Love the soup dumplings which as light and tasty without being oily. We usually stick with the more normal dishes but love it either way.","4 из 5 кружков","130EAED5173A41AB2151DEAB7D1A9EA7","Отзыв написан 27 октября 2016"
"I eaten repeatedly at Din Tai Fung near Yuyang Fandien in Beijing. The dumplings are simply great. They manage to consistently deliver high quality and taste. I am especially a fan of their crab dumpling variations, which are excellent. The cleanliness of Din Tai Fungs kitchen is unrivalled in China and you can watch the preparation of fresh dumplings through a window. A nice touch.

The crowd is a mix between Chinese and foreigners due to the fame of the place. Expect to wait a bit for a table during rush hours, so if you can, call ahead for a reservation. When seated, waiters will also make sure any hand bags or coats are securely stored ina small pouch so they are not stained should some parts of your or your neighbours meal travel that far ;-)

While the place is certainly famous for its dumplings and most people go there for them, they also serve great tea and I especially love their sesame noodles, not to forget the vegetables, which are full of flavour and cooked excellently.

What else deserves mentioning is that their menu offers a simple icon aided choice to ask staff to avoid MSG in dished. Love this!

One last thing: they have airco and use it. You might want to bring a sweater.","5 из 5 кружков","6FE164141C48A24BD2E94BF98E88239F","Отзыв написан 24 октября 2016"

"We eaten at other DTF places before but we thought that this was the best so far. The dumplings were fresh, tasty and piping hot. We liked the soupy contents that are contained in many of the dumplings and particularly liked the black sesame seed ones although they were a little slow on serving these ones.","5 из 5 кружков","1C12761AF89E3E4B7C4712B9C9D78EFB","Отзыв написан 15 октября 2016"
"We arrived here and the restaurant looked like a fine dining resturant, it had two levels. We were placed on level 2 which was fairly empty. The menu was extensive, the waiters brought bag holders to rest our bags on and took orders. Dumpings were amazing however very small. Also had chocolate dumpling which is definitely worth a try! Staff were helpful enough to get us a taxi to the stadium which we could not say in chinese. Would go back again, also wasnt too expensive and the toilet seats were heated.","5 из 5 кружков","A4152AC691F58AA8291F39705569D46E","Отзыв написан 12 октября 2016"
"The menu ""book"" was extensive. We arrived in Beijing late and choose Ding Tai Fung for lunch the next day. Our first meal in China did not disappoint.

"I read the reviews and have come to the conclusion they must write their own!
service very poor
Food almost cold
over priced rubbish
To cap it all they impose a 10% service charge
Not the norm here in China obviously a chain
Will never use again","2 из 5 кружков","16D9859AB3D1B03E95597C2E9B42A020","Отзыв написан 7 октября 2016"
"We loved this restaurant. Our friend had recommended it and we just happened upon it looking for lunch while site seeing in Beijing. The dumplings with the soup in them are just so delicious!!!! The location was central and it was easy to communicate with the server which was a plus. The kitchen is open so you can watch the people making the dumplings. It's was so clean too.

"After reading the rave reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to try Din Tai Fung. Whilst the service was good and the food tasty, I can honestly say that I didn't notice a huge difference from this restaurant to any other that we dined in during our Beijing stay.

The decor is nice and its clear that the restaurant has won many awards. Decent restaurant but not quite sure why so many outstanding reviews...","4 из 5 кружков","5B17C60AB7BD3F50C979D3B4E7DEA72E","Отзыв написан 3 октября 2016"
"Thought the food was very good (and loved the chocolate dumplings for dessert) but overall almost 10x more expensive than a local dumpling shop that we liked even more (total cost around $60 for two people) and the restaurant is just in a mall (not the best atmosphere - though it is a cool, high end mall). I would try other places before going back here but don't want to take away too much because the food is very good (just think there is a lot of competition).","4 из 5 кружков","5B181BF17CE343C542BBE9DCAB783538","Отзыв написан 29 сентября 2016"
"Din Tai Fung (Yuyang) has become a favorite during our stay in Beijing. It has great dimsums and a variety to choose from. The seafood dumpling is superb.The vegetable dishes are excellent. Efficient service and good value for money. The best thing is it is located close to where we are staying at Oakwoods Residence.","5 из 5 кружков","49B4793FB44C7B3234037906E4A9F1E8","Отзыв написан 28 сентября 2016"
"The taxi driver could not find the restaurant so we were dropped at the Yunyang Hotel and were pointed in the direction of the restaurant- as we progressed down a dark unmade up street we became increasingly nervous asking every 50 yards or so for directions from the map provided by the hotel. We arrived at what the doorman assured us was the right place. Sat down and had the most delicious dinner- great dim sum; great vegtables and the best fried rice I have eaten for many years. Outstanding.","5 из 5 кружков","8FD55EA4BDC4BEFBD0E077A775B70398","Отзыв написан 27 сентября 2016"

"Made to order fresh. 5 star for fresh food and value. The best in Beijing by far!!

I sought out based on trip advisor reviews and it was spot on.

Soup dumplings made to order served fresh ! Could not believe it was not packed and its in a mall food court.

No tourists but truly amazing . Must go if your a foodie. Near lama Temple.

Seafood special soup dumpling served piping hot was the best.

No sauces needed on these. Shrimp and pork was awesome too , noodles great.

Value was amazing and food 5 stars. Best dumplings I ever had!!!!!

Watch them thru glass as they make your order.

Please open in USA. Im still craving these bundles of joy weeks later!!! Great job guys.","5 из 5 кружков","728AEFDCFAA68B7786E384C1ED4FFE49","Отзыв написан 15 сентября 2016"

"We have eaten here a dozen or more times. Reason: it's that good! Their dumplings
are fantastic. Their soup dumplings are something we dream about. Hot beef stock together with a beef ball inside of a dumping. Just the right size, but you have to watch out because the soup is hot. The rest of their menu is full of winners. Decor: quite contemporary.

"love and hate this place - as a chain restaurant, they do a good job, beijing, shanghai, los angeles or Taipei its all good- still a chain restaurant though, good standards in quality and sanitation but still rather mass produced - enjoy my fav is the crab roe baozi, double boiled chicken soup and ice mountain","5 из 5 кружков","FE0044320CB1A8003260F3393D87350D","Отзыв написан 23 августа 2016"
"As number 6 out of more than 10,000 restaurants in Beijing I expected it to be pretty good, especially after having such a good experience with the restaurant that is rated number 7 in the list.
I guess Din Tai Fung has very good PR, otherwise I can't explain how they got those reviews.
The dumplings are good. The chick, that I took following the waiter's recommendation, was average, not more, not less.
The steamed rice cake was bad.
The total price of 151 yuan was way too much for what I've got and definitely for the quality of it.
The waiters kept asking me if all is good but didn't bother to listen to the answer, just asked in a robotic way.

Bottom line - you can find much cheaper dumplings and even better ones.","2 из 5 кружков","F5BBB859A5BF8347B80CD80E49DD30AC","Отзыв написан 21 августа 2016"

"We had difficulty ordering in restaurants as majority of waiters cannot speak English. We get by as travelers always do. But Din Tai Fung had staff that speak English so she was able to explain the types of dimsum that they have.

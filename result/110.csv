"Have eaten here twice in the past few weeks. This restaurant is exceptionally clean, with ample space for a large crowd. I really enjoyed the variety of saugage options; chicken, mashed potatoes and more. The beer, while enjoyable, is pricey compared to other establishments. Service was very good. A live band plays from 9pm onward--a group from the Phillipines--very musically...

Beer at 66 yuan per half-liter and food similarly overpriced. Do yourself a favor and walk a bit further down the street to Brotzeit. The atmosphere may not be quite as ""German"" but the food...

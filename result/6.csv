"I've been craving dumplings ever since my husband and I arrived in China, but vegetarian fillings are hard to come by. We joined Joyce's cooking class yesterday evening where I was able to make my very own vegetarian dumplings with minced tofu, shitaki mushroom, celery, and glass noodles. Joyce was a great host and welcomed us with traditional Chinese tea, seasonal fruits and snacks. She gave us step-by-step instructions, was patient with all of our questions, and humoured us as we tried to learn the proper folding techniques. We had dinner together and chatted as if we were old friends, sharing stories from our different countries and cultures. Definitely the highlight of our time in Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","D480BA9AA4B31DD2F7E4D754D83FEC9D","4 марта 2017"
"We wanted a bit more of a relaxed night for our final night in Beijing. This class was exactly what we needed!
Joyce arranged such an easy spot to meet us and from there just a quick walk to the kitchen. She gave us some delicious Lunar New Year treats as well as fresh fruit and delicious tea to get us settled in. Then she brought out all the ingredients for us and explained and demonstrated what we needed to do! Our dumplings and noodles were delicious, will need a bit more work when we make them at home to perfect the shape haha! The food was fresh, a lovely environment and Joyce was an absolute pleasure to meet!!
Would highly recommend this class for anyone after a relaxed night but still wanting to experience Chinese culture! Loved it!!","5 из 5 кружков","E67BD2AB92C6329FA229DAB72F421375","Отзыв написан 7 февраля 2017"
"We were looking for something unique to do after a few action packed days in Beijing. We reserved a lunch session with Joyce for our group (4 adults and 3 kids). From the moment we arrived we felt very welcomed and a part of the action. She walked us through how to make the dumplings and noodles and took time to explain all of the spices and ingredients. She was very interactive with our kids and they never once seemed bored or disinterested.

The entire process was an absolute blast. I think this will definitely be up there for one of our top memories in Beijing. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun way to spend some time, have a few drinks, learn how to make food and then (best of all) enjoy the meal!!!","5 из 5 кружков","8B42E68C894485AD854F35D5141A8D9E","Отзыв написан 20 декабря 2016"
"I have found Joyce' kitchen by accident while having a walk through the hutongs next to the Lama temple, and was very happy I did! I joined a cooking class and besides learning how to make dumplings with three different fillings, I got to know many stories and products of the traditional Chinese cuisine and cooking culture as the class was in English and the hostess Joyce told us many interesting things you only can learn from real Chinese people. The two other cooking class students were from other countries, so it was also a great intercultural experience. We laughed a lot trying our best imitating the skilful technique of folding the dumplings the right way showed by Joyce but in the end our boiled and fried dumplings, as well as the long chinese noodles have been very delicious! After dinner we tried some of the Nuoyan Rice wine, which we liked a lot, so that Joyce invited us to join the Nuoyan Rice wine tasting at a special wine house the next day. Also a unique and great experience I would recommend. I really enjoyed this weekend!","5 из 5 кружков","E27E73E43884620A4CA8ED6B88E2561E","Отзыв написан 18 декабря 2016"

"What a great break from busy touring it was to spend time with Joyce in her lovely Huton space learning to make dumplings and noodles.

Everything was super clean and organized. The ingredients were all fresh and savory.

Joyce was spot on with our special requests. There was soothing music on. And after we ate Joyce, a friendly and balanced soul, chatted with us at length about her childhood memories, etc.

It was a very nice experience.","5 из 5 кружков","3C7A7A18513D005BED31C3EA9D710A75","Отзыв написан 25 ноября 2016"
"What a fun night we had! Making our own delicious dumplings and noddles ... delicious because Joyce the hostess and owner prepares the ingredients and guides you every step of the way... fun because, well ... how often do you get to make your own dumplings and noddles and eat what you make, plus Joyce was the perfect hostess and instructor. Beer and wine included in the RMB 300 per person.","5 из 5 кружков","5B025F3FAD6D1F1E91F7E9517CF5AA74","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2016"
"This was a very enjoyable way to spend the afternoon. Joyce was such a wonderful hostess, she welcomed us to her cooking class with wine, rice wine, and nonalcoholic beverages should we have wanted them. The dumplings were delicious as were the pulled noodles. I would definitely recommend this class is such an enjoyable and educational way to appreciate Beijing culture as seen through the eyes of a local.","5 из 5 кружков","8C4C02A3FBFCAFE2438C902D1E61C13E","Отзыв написан 13 ноября 2016"

"The booking was easy and Joyce's response was very prompt with clear directions.

Although the place was small but very warm, clean and welcoming. We were a group of eight so we have the place by ourselves. Joyce treated us with a cup of nice tea and snacks to start with. Then we learned how to make dumpling from scratch....and also a easy way to do noodles. Joyce also offered us wine to go with the meal. Three hours passed very quickly with lots of laughter.

We have been to Beijing many times but this experience was the very first. We definitely will go back on our next visit, and we highly recommend this excellent fun place to our friends.","5 из 5 кружков","1CC809F17D2B0D1EBC968127206187DB","Отзыв написан 3 ноября 2016"

"This was one of my favorite activities in Beijing. We booked a class on a Sunday night and we were the only ones to sign up, so we had the room and lesson to ourselves! Joyce met us at a coffee shop that was easy to find. We then walked through the neighborhood ally ways to reach the kitchen/dining room. We started off by making dough. Then we learned to stuff and fold dumplings. Last we made noodles. Joyce was a great teacher and we had a lot of fun getting to know her. The food was delicious and we left stuffed and happy! I'm glad Joyce is going to be able to renovate her space, she has a great class and I recommend checking it out! The only thing I would change is that I did not receive a copy of the recipes we made. It would have been great to know the portions to use when I came home.","5 из 5 кружков","D419ADE8AFE5EDE874A101269D90CB1E","Отзыв написан 31 октября 2016"
"Joyce met us outside by the coffee shop so we could find our way. She walked us through the rustic back alleys of the local neighborhood. What an experience and sight to see. We felt very safe. Her kitchen was quaint and charming. Joyce and her assistant were great! She taught us to make from scratch delicious traditional Chinese dumplings and noodles.

It was just my husband and me so we got to know and ask tons of questions about her, her family, and China. My only wish is that we experienced this soon in our trip as she had some great advice!

I made some for my family at home and it turned out amazing!

Thank you for everything Joyce!","5 из 5 кружков","42B4DADD2A30A7C44B1112607E067431","Отзыв написан 28 октября 2016"
"The dumplings we had here were the best ones we had in Beijing! Beyond that, it was cool to have basically a private lunch in a cozy home. The host spoke excellent English and was super friendly, giving us tips for visiting the lama temple after lunch.

"I saved this place on my list to do in China and kind of forgot about it. I am so glad I got lost and stumbled upon it, right away I signed up for the class. Oh boy was I not mistaken. The class is not big but very cozy and clean. Soft music playing in the background. Joyce is so joyful and sweet. Everything is made fresh prepped in front of you. We learned how to mix the dough for the dumplings and noodles. The fillings choices depend on what the group like and if anybody has allergies. Very accommodating which takes the whole experience into the next level. Drinks are offered, wine beer or soda.
We got to sample the most traditional moon cake and different snacks... Unforgettable night. The food was amazing. The flavors heaven! Oh how I wish to have one of these dumplings right now! Hands down the best dumplings I've ever had! It is her family's recipe.
It didn't stop at that! Joyce invited us to go to a tea event, the family that was there decided to go back to the hotel they have a young child. She ended up taking me on her scooter. The attending ""a class"" turned into the best night I spent in China! I didn't only learn the art of making dumplings but the art of brewing tea with the locals. All of that thanks to Joyce!
From Joyce to Joyce thank you!
And to whoever is reading this review do not miss this unique and unforgettable experience in China","5 из 5 кружков","9CDF826292F27A10543E8C1B7C547531","Отзыв написан 18 сентября 2016"

"Was a must vist for me and trip advisor was right. Fresh made to order

Loved the soup dumplings, noodle dish too.

Had special seafood soup dumpling and then ordered more, pork and,shrimp was awesome

No old dumpling here this was so fresh you can watch them make it.

Great for the true foodie.

This in not a tourist spot, in a local mall off food court but if you want the best this is it!!

Very special treat and great value.","5 из 5 кружков","728AEFDCFAA68B7786E384C1ED4FFE49","Отзыв написан 15 сентября 2016"
"We were amazed at how tidy Joyce's kitchen was! It was truly a pleasure to take a class here. It is set in a traditional Chinese Hutong, although as Joyce explained, all the tenants built rooms into the courtyard and now it's just a hallway, so it's now a courtyardless Hutong.

Her style of teaching is very soft and gentle. She preps most of the ingredients for you so it doesn't require a whole lot of prep and knife skills like other classes. Joyce demonstrates the mixing of the dough, kneading, rolling and filling of the dumplings. Then you knead the dough and roll out the dumpling skins. Yours will not look like Joyce's; this is something that requires a LOT of practice to gain any kind of expertise! Then Joyce's kitchen assistant will steam the dumplings, and then you will eat them. Delicious.

Next, we stretch the dough prepared by Joyce to make noodles; hers will be straight and thin, yours will be thick and lumpier. Then her assistant will boil the noodles and you will eat the noodles with an amazing eggplant sauce prepared by the assistant, and this also is really yummy.

Throughout the evening, she served us snacks and beverages. It started raining while we were taking the class, and she even supplied ponchos for us to take with us. Joyce is truly delightful and I can't say enough good things about what a pleasure she was to work with.

Joyce accommodated our dietary needs (vegetarian) and those of another class participant (peanut allergy). She books via email, and will get your dietary requirements beforehand and will accommodate very easily. She is very communicative and very flexible. A true pleasure to deal with!

We also took a class from Beijing Cooking School a couple of days earlier, and it was a completely different experience. Equally wonderful, but completely different. Joyce's kitchen is amazingly tidy and pretty, Chef Chao's is functional; manly, not pretty. Joyce's class has a lot more handholding, Chef Chao's class is a lot more hands-on. We thoroughly enjoyed both styles of classes. I highly recommend both!","5 из 5 кружков","38AB9DD19B5211E9D612AE2DABA41051","Отзыв написан 11 сентября 2016"
"Apprendre a faire des dumplings, et ensuite les deguster, c'est genial ! Joyce est une hote super, tout est tres propre, et les dumplings sont vraiment bon !

"What to say about Joyce and her team that hasn't already been said?! From the moment we got in touch by email to the final mouth-full of beautiful tasting dumplings, this experience was delightful. In addition to the dumplings, we had great company of 4 and it was a great experience learning how to cook dumplings and noodles. We had a nice surprise with a ""secret ingredient"" dumpling too! Ha. Thanks Joyce! Generous offerings and decent selection of beverages to accompany meal. We most definitely highly recommend this cooking class to all and sundry!","5 из 5 кружков","08DF4A17F4E747690C89A5806BBB308E","Отзыв написан 26 августа 2016"
"It was a cool experience. The place is very clean, the process of subscribing for the dumpling class really easy, uncomplicated, and flexible (Joyce also offers vegetarian options). And most importantly, the dumplings are great. Joyce also does very well with taking care of her guests by offering beer, wine and complimentary snacks while making the dumplings. Moreover, she is very friendly, helpful and speaks English really well.

As a result, it feels like being at someone's home, which is a great experience. The only 'problem' is that another lady prepares a lot of things up-front (cutting vegetables etc.) and also boils or fries the dumplings so you don't get to do the whole process. But this is more of a minor thing and some people probably even prefer it that way.","5 из 5 кружков","121B6475C0678B9F490813A933883A01","Отзыв написан 22 августа 2016"

"Sono trovato questa attivita grazie a Tripadvisor, e mi sono divertita tantissimo! Ho preso parte ad una lezione di cucina molto semplice, adatta anche alle famiglie con bambini. Ho imparato anche come fare i ravioli cinesi (al vapore e alla piastra) e i noodles saltati. E' richiesta una prenotazione diretta dal loro sito compilata in inglese per prendere parte alla lezione.
Caldamente consigliato!

I've found this activity thanks to Tripadvisor, and it was really funny! I've participate to a cooking lesson that was truly easy, accessible also to families with children. I learned how to do dumplings (steamed and grilled) and stir-fried noodles. It is necessary to book the course in advance by their website.

"This cooking class is OUT OF THE ORDINARY !!
GREAT overall AMAZING EXPERIENCE !

WHATS SO SPECIAL ?
You get to see and experience where the old locals live, humble cottage small houses, tiny kitchen, shared toilet, small alleys etc. Enjoyed soaking in the simple old Beijing lifestyle in Hutong.

JOYCE
She gave very clear instruction on where to meet and came on time. She is so warm and friendly and passionate in her cooking class. She took care of every small detail, from offering of fruit infused water,small basket of cherries and biscuits on table, helping to buy us cold drinks etc.

COOKING CLASS
ITS FUN and so meaningfull learning to make dumpling and noodles from scratch and ending up having them as your dinner, how awesome !! The noodles and dumplings taste so good too.

DEPARTURE
Joyce offered to book uber driver for us and led us to the car and ensured our safety before leaving.

"My husband and I participated in this cooking class back in October while in Beijing and we had such a fun time. The class was fully booked the night we went. It's not a big space so you may want to book ahead if you have limited time in Beijing. Joyce meets the group at an easy to find coffee shop and walks everyone to the house. She gives a little history on the area while walking there which is nice. Once there, she demonstrates how to make different dumplings and after you prepare the dumpling stuffing as a group, you get to make your own dumplings. Ours definitely weren't as pretty as hers but they still tasted really good! She supplements the groups dumplings with some of her own plus a side dish and drinks. It's an informative class that's very laid back and a lot of fun. The dumplings were really tasty!","5 из 5 кружков","E366AEAF8A541E88FB595226DF1DDA55","Отзыв написан 4 мая 2016"

"The communication with Joyce from my initial enquiry was outstanding, she even got me some names of tailors in the area when I asked if she knew any. Her instructions on getting to the meeting place were fantastic and she collected us right on time. It was lovely to have a walk through the hutong before getting to Joyce's quaint little restaurant. The class started with some nibbles which were great and then we got stuck into it. We made one meat and two vegetarian dumplings and also some noodles. Joyce's instructions were clear and easy to follow, she also has a lovely and warm nature which makes you very comfortable. I would highly recommend doing Joyce's cooking class while in Beijing! The dumplings tasted amazing and we even got some surprise chocolate ones for dessert!!!","5 из 5 кружков","93909F00CDEB1D09D099B85B64096FB3","Отзыв написан 12 апреля 2016"
"A great way to learn how to make dumplings/noodles from scratch and you get to eat the fruits of your labour at the end too (as well as more dumplings that the professionals have made.

She was very accommodating with our last minute booking and even though we had limited time in Beijing, we're glad that we did this.","5 из 5 кружков","1F855BC9287E00425B346AD2D18AF068","Отзыв написан 5 апреля 2016"
"We enjoyed this experience so much! We went down a small hutong (street) into a local home to learn how to make authentic dumplings.

Joyce was so great - she's friendly, prompt, quick to respond (we booked the day of and got lucky with availability). We had so much fun making dumplings and noodles! I really recommend doing this if you are in Beijing.

Word of advice: if you can't make it after booking- please let her know. The night we went, three people no-showed on her. This isn't a restaurant with tons of seating, she's a super nice and knowledgeable local who spends the money and time preparing for these dinners. Standing her up costs her time and money - and it's just plain rude and irresponsible too!

Joyce speaks perfect English and was so helpful in translating some things for us too! In summary- delicious food, incredible and authentic experience and a great host! Highly recommended!","5 из 5 кружков","1AA577AFD61D3D735D653A310E3F8847","Отзыв написан 28 марта 2016"
"My tour group came here to eat after endlessly looking through all the many places to eat in this lovely city, we were not disappointed. Although we spoke little Chinese the staff were patient and looked after us well. The food was of a very high standard the dumplings were to die for","5 из 5 кружков","1F0010D25E399E5DE557DF279E9B23EE","Отзыв написан 18 марта 2016"
"Нам очень понравилось это кафе! Быстрое обслуживание, очень вкусная традиционная китайская еда - лапша, пельмени, другая пища. Тихое место, народу было немного.","5 из 5 кружков","DDFFF06F5395C44BC4067C13AE265138","Отзыв написан 17 марта 2016"
"I surprised my family by making a reservation for this experience on Christmas day, and we all had a blast!

The owner/host Joyce picks you up at a Costa Coffee near Lama Temple, and leads you into the hutong. The location really adds to the experience, as you go deep into a hutong with a local.

Joyce then teaches you how to make dumplings - she has the fillings prepared by her staff, but you make the dough and form the dumplings. My family's were great, mine .... ehhh ... kind of sad-shaped. The dumplings are then boiled and fried (two different ways) and the feast begins. So tasty. We then learned to make hand-made pulled noodles, and of course ate those too.

Joyce is a fantastic host, and her English is excellent!

I don't know why this is listed in the restaurant category. Maybe Joyce does run a restaurant there at night or on off days, but we were there for the cooking class, which was offered twice a day.

I give this experience a top 5 star rating -- thank you Joyce!!","5 из 5 кружков","A6376C676C0F0CC0DA0034B9F54C2BD3","Отзыв написан 5 марта 2016"
"We were very interested in attending a cooking class while in Beijing. We initially considered Black Sesame, but our tour guide, Vivie, recommended her sister's dumpling and noodle making class in the hutong and we were so glad we did! Joyce was technically not conducting classes during the week we were in Beijing, as it was still the second week of the Lunar New Year holiday there. But she very graciously accommodated us, even though she was planning to fly to Shanghai early the next morning. The class was such a great experience. Her cooking studio is in a hutong - so the setting is quite unique. We learned how to make the dough for the dumpling wrappers and pulled noodles. We made 2 different types of dumplings (pork and chive), a noodle dish with a fresh tomato sauce - and Joyce served us some snacks and side dishes, as well as wine. It was such a wonderful experience. Highly recommend it if you are adventurous and looking for something different to do in Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","47E2E9D251387F562B091861C82232A4","Отзыв написан 25 февраля 2016"
"Our family of 5 from the Boston area truly enjoyed this unique experience - learning how to make Chinese dumplings and noodles when in Beijing. We booked a 5pm dinner session, and were joined by one other couple. Joyce was our very pleasant, welcoming and enthusiastic chef, who spoke excellent English and shared her knowledge about Beijing customs, lifestyle and cuisine. She met us at a local coffee shop and walked us through the Hutong area to a home used for this cooking and dining experience. After we finished preparing our fillings, wrapping dumplings and pulling noodles, we were treated to wine and soft drinks as we enjoyed sampling all of the food we prepared. What a valuable experience for us to share as a family! One of the best things we did in Beijing!","5 из 5 кружков","0893ED5D1A227D79A6B1BB08354D3265","Отзыв написан 26 января 2016"
"Joyce met me in the local Costa coffee shop which was very easy to find per her instructions. She is very welcoming, speaks excellent English and is knowledgable about the dumplings and noodles that she expertly shows you how to make in her hutong. I will definitely be trying to make them again at home; they were delicious! We spent a good while talking about various things (including the lovely rice wine which she markets and lets you taste) after dinner which was also very enjoyable - all in all a great evening which I would recommend to everyone.","5 из 5 кружков","B91A5FCB72E021617BB949770EE05FF9","Отзыв написан 21 января 2016"

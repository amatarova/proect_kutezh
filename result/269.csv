"This is actually a great place to have dinner with your friends.

"For RMB 218 you get all you can eat, all you can drink on a pretty extensive menu. Options include the obvious Teppanyaki, sushi, salads, sake, beer, etc. Highlights were the beef, the broccoli, and the absolute highlight for us was the fried banana which they grill and then serve with a scoop of ice cream. Service was perfectly decent....

"Well first don't expect the highest quality for 200 RMB. The food is ok. Service is below average. We couldn't order any drinks or food after 2h, but that seems normal.

"Great teppanyaki place, nice to go with friends. Most places in the world to go eat at a teppanyaki place is very expensive but this is not in western standards. For Beijing is more pricey. Food is good and fresh and to take the all you can eat is a great deal and includes alcohol.","4 из 5 кружков","8181CFF9AF93C02D274B0009ECD61DFB","Отзыв написан 12 января 2016"

"Since I've been living in Asia; always enjoyed teppanyaki bars in many places. Tairyo is a GOOD place, with TERRIBLE service. Staff makes you eat like a desperado, always hurrying you up. If you an extra piece of meat or sushi, they will say NO. i understand that they don't want to put leftovers in the garbage, but SERVICE attitude...

"This was our first time trying Teppanyaki and we really enjoyed it. It is located in a complex opposite the workers stadium where there are other restaurants and bars, just off a main road. We paid 258RMB each this allowed us to have anything off the menu apart from the Lobster and one or two other dishes as well as...

"This is a good restaurant for trying new things. Pay 200rmb and you can eat and drink anything from the menu. Gary recommended the mint leaves wrapped in meat and Tom said the snails were nice.

"All the Tairyo restaurants run off the same gimmick. For a couple hundred RMB you get unlimited food and unlimited beer and sake. It's the second part of this deal that usually gets me to go to this place. It's ideal for large groups who want to get sloshed before heading out to the bars for the night. The food...

The waiters poured things several times to guests, and even didn't say 'sorry' for that. Also they say that they close at 11 pm. But they started to collect the plates around 10-30, even didnt...

"Delicious Sichuan cuisine served in an upscale manner, chic and posh for sure but beware of the spiciness. Do try their Spicy Angus Tenderloin Beef, it was quite addictive. However, don't forget to check the price because this restaurant is quite expensive.","4 из 5 кружков","C080A2CBC9E1DC1AF2B043DD6387B5F1","Отзыв написан 18 ноября 2016"

I love every menus that we ordered but most favourite was Koushuiji or Sichuan Chicken served chilled with plenty of sichuan chillies and white sesame on top. It goes really nice with warm steamed rice. Simple menu like stir fried wingbeats...

"A modern take one of the spicy parts of the Chinese cuisine - this is absolutely a place where you feel well taken care of.

"We ordered the beef jerky to start and the summer rolls with spicy crab which we are confident was (oddly) made with seafood-extender rather than crab. Jerky was great. The tea smoke duck was good but the tea flavour particularly in the vegetables was overwhelming. Nice wine list but we had to order three to find a bottle they had...

"This is arguably one of the nicer dining rooms to sit in Sanlitun, and most of the food is pretty decent (hong shao rou was very good even). Other dishes such as bamboo shoots were probably taken out of a bag, and plated, whilst crab rolls featured a tiny bit of crab meat, and were served so cold that even...

"Transit is one place that I could always go back to in Beijing. During my 3 years living in the city, Transit was the place where I would always go. A restaurant that you know everything is done with the best quality in mind. The decor apparently was done by owner himself. All the details, the service, the food and...

"Modern Sichuan cuisine, restaurant with nice decor Service is ok but not great and it is a bit overpriced. I believe this is more a place for couple/ small group of friends as the portion of the dishes is small which makes it difficult to share.","5 из 5 кружков","2480D0C2B7001C9D1C0736D626A16B1E","Отзыв написан 18 октября 2014"
"Had wonderful lunch with my daughter and a local Chinese friend and business associate. Excellent Sichuan food, spicy as expected, in very comfortable setting in upscale shopping and residential area of Beijing. Well prepared and gracefully presented dishes, more refined than we had in Chengdu. Highly recommend for an occasion, business lunch or dinner.","5 из 5 кружков","BAE3552B89E787572379579E27B3AE34","Отзыв написан 1 июля 2014"

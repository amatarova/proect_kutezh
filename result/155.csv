"As coffee addicts in need of caffeination, Flat White was the perfect fix!

"Went back there because I had a nice steak last time, although it was overpriced. This time I ordered the eggs benedict. The poached eggs were almost cooked through and the English-muffin bread was doughy. The supposedly Hollandaise sauce was inexplicably sour which ended more like a salad dressing.

"I dragged my wife and tour guide in as I needed a caffeine fix. I ordered a macchiato and had to explain it was an espresso with a dash of milk. It was the most bitter coffee I have had in a long time. Not sure whether it was the beans, an unclean cup ( detergent residue) or something else....

"We decided to have lunch here as we were craving Western food by this point on our trip in China. We had a simple vegetarian pasta dish which was tasty. The coffee was also decent.

"The offer of food is not the biggest - but it's a cafe and that's good this way! Like the small, somewhat retro place offering a cozy place for some lunch breaks or coffee on the weekend strolls after and while exploring 798. Many other choices there as well, but certainly not a wrong one. Give it a try.","4 из 5 кружков","C1229769DA16DB0DE9837F1B115A3983","Отзыв написан 16 сентября 2015"

"Flatwhite 798 was a cool place to eat in a very cool part of Beijing. The food was good, prices were reasonable. This arts neighborhood is vast.

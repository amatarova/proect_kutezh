"I had dinner at Palms LA Kitchen recently with my family, in the Liangmaqiao location. The location is a bit difficult to find at first, being amongst a range of office/hotel and apartment towers, but once we arrived we were greeted by very friendly staff. The food is best described as “California Style Mexican Fusion”, incorporating a few Korean dishes...

"Cool place and very hip. They do some excellent cocktails and kimichi bites, with cuisine with influences from Mexico and Korea, lots of pork which is my favorite meat.","5 из 5 кружков","F728F564ECBEA2916503E3420E61054C","Отзыв написан 22 октября 2016"
"It's no surprise that the owner is actually from California--they totally nail the quality, freshness, atmosphere, and flavors of West Coast fusion food. I especially love the bulgogi burrito and the chorizo tacos (those come as part of the lunch set). Service is always legitimately friendly and prices are very reasonable.","5 из 5 кружков","5142F6932A693B633B54FB1B4FB806AA","Отзыв написан 24 августа 2016"
"Have been ordering from Palms LA for almost a year on Sherpas. This was the first time I went to the restaurant. It was very cool and excellent. The food was great and the drinks were strong. We actually went for the first Drag Bingo event. (Yes Drag queen bingo). Very fun and money went to a very good cause....

"This branch of Palms L.A. is a bit hard to find, but worth the effort. It's great for both lunch and dinner, and the upstairs floor can serve as a great private room for a party. The dishes are consistently good. Though there doesn't seem to be much rotation of the menu, the variety is broad enough to make it...

"Gonna make it short: Although a bit complicated to find (even for Beijingren), this is a great second location of Palms! + great interior! + great acoustics (never too loud, even if crowded) + great food, great for sharing, there's something for everybody on the menu + perfect value for the money ;) I can highly recommend coming here with...

"Service: The service is cheery, happy and always polite. They refill my water whenever its empty which is hard to find in a casual setting here. Food: What can I say? Its always fresh and creative. Yum! It all tastes just like their original location. I thought that they wouldn't be able to keep it consistent but they nailed it....

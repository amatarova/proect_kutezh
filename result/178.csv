"Fabulous restaurant, not vegetarian but they serve vegetarian food upon request. Their fries tofu is beyond compare. Mouth watering food. Very crowded during lunch time, hence booking in advance is thoroughly recommended. You may book online using your mobile device. Pleasant staff and great tasting Taiwanese food.

"We have to visit bellagio everytime we are in Beijing. During the recent 5-6 days stay, we went there three times and still never got sick of it. San bei ji (<U+4E09><U+676F><U+9E21>)is a must to have, it is consistently yummy and goes very well with steamed rice.

"On a rainy September night we dashed the few blocks from the Marriott Northeast to this bright little restaurant and were rewarded nicely for our efforts. The large, spicy hot soups and sweet-and-sour fish dishes were just what we were seeking. Each dish was beautifully presented and were filled with flavor. As our Mandarin is very limited we had to...

"Back after 8 years from the city but the standard of food is still great as before. Try the 3 cup chicken for sure. Went to the branch near to worker's stadium.

"In China, unlike the US, chain restaurants and mall restaurants can actually be good. Bellagio is a good example. There are several locations located throughout Beijing. This review is for the branch in the Joy City mall, Xidan. From the name you might expect Italian food, but it's Taiwanese. All the dishes we ordered were good and reasonably priced. Some...

"Chanced upon Bellagio in Sanlitun during my recent visit. It was a favorite for the family. Unfortunately the branch in Sanlitun did not measure up. The beef noodle was a bit diluted in taste.

"I went a few times to Bellagio, I like their couch seats at the back of the restaurant. It's comfortable and cozy. Food is always good, a bit pricy for the quantity you receive though.

"We happened across this cafe while ambling around Beijing, heading in the direction of the Forbidden City. It was a welcome sight on a particularly cold day. We were able to warm up and have a good meal and hot tea. The service was good and our stay was pleasant.","4 из 5 кружков","CE7456E814453D566C9BDE6946688CCF","Отзыв написан 5 декабря 2014"

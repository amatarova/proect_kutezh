"Although a great view from the Restaurant, the cost of dinner was outrageous. One pre dinner drink, two courses and a bottle of wine (reasonably priced), resulted in a bill of almost $200 per person. Yes, food was great, however value for money not there. Service was ok, again not to the level of cost.","4 из 5 кружков","747DEF0F844F1BBE660F6AD2EC670BC4","Отзыв написан 8 февраля 2017"
"The buffet breakfast provides you different kinds of dishes from northen to southern China. Every dish reflects the high expectation from the cook and the management. You can rarely find a local restaurant that can provide similar quality of food.","5 из 5 кружков","3BF7517AB5A5785337B1A273F556928C","Отзыв написан 17 января 2017"
"Grill 79 is a fantastic venue. Great food and service and mix it with a great view to Beijing is amazing. After a very good dinner, the evening is closed with a good beer in the bar, a few steps and higher ground than the restaurant. I can warmly recommend the restaurant to all those, who want to mix good...

"- Phantastic view from the 79th floor of Beijing World Trade Centre - Surprisingly relaxed atmosphere and service at lunch time (dont know about dinner). Given the hotel's brand and the location, I was afraid of a very formal atmosphere, but both the guests and the waiters pleasantly ""normal"", guests just enjoying the food and the view. You do not...

"This is a wonderful place to experience a view over Beijing (on a clear day) while dining on some wonderful dishes. The style is western but some dishes with a slight Asian flavour. The service was excellent and the wine list has something for everyone. It is not cheap eats but was surprisingly less expensive than I expected.","5 из 5 кружков","1B094AA36C595005647D7056E6E2F03D","Отзыв написан 1 августа 2016"
"Te restaurant features a good prix fixe lunch menu, with three courses. The cost is about 30-40 USD, which is pretty good given that it is in a 5-star hotel in the center of town. The food was well prepared, and the service was good. The restaurant is beautifully decorated; it is on the 79th floor and has a nice...

"I was really looking forward to the restaurant but was disappointed. It really is a steak house but usually there are other options that would be just as good. The wine list may be extensive but they do not carry most of it, we had to go through 3 different wines before we found one in stock. Of course the...

"Great Views Of The City...IF Not Only For The Smog. Average Prices Just Like Any 'Shang' In Asia. Tired The 'Set Lunch' Menu Which Will Last Until End Year, Cost 360RMB Per Head. Well worth The Price. Service Was Very Good. P.S: It Helps If You 'Flash' Your GC Card.","4 из 5 кружков","C9E32B5274D74FD465F898DF22D32C6D","Отзыв написан 22 октября 2015"
"This is a beautiful restaurant and a great option if you are entertaining or wish to partake the view of Beijing. The restaurant itself is very overpriced and your bill can easily skyrocket if you are not careful. However, the staff does not pressure you to order three courses which is a plus. The food is decent, but honestly we...

"Trading on its position of being 97 floors atop the BJ outpost of one of Asia's most famous hotel chains, it yet again here it also follows that the almost infallible restaurant 'don't go' guide for travellers is :"" if it's rotating or elevated, with fantastic views, don't go!"" Grill 97 is expensive because it simply doesn't deliver the centrepiece...

"I had dinner with two friends. The views are stunning indeed, and it was a reasonably clear night by Beijing standards. Our experiemce was mixed. We had the Seafood Display for starter and it was excellent. There are generous portions of lobster, crab, scallops, shrimps and (white) sashimi. Two of us had lobster bisque and one had asparagus soup. Both...

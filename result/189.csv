"The specials are now happening every weekday. Monday-hamburgers, Tuesday-Enchiladas, Wednesday-burritos, Thursday-Sandwiches and Friday-Mexican Tortilla (which are build your own soft taco.) The food is filling and believe it or not they are getting better and are now pretty tasty. The burgers have always been good and the enchiladas are pretty good. It is quite packed at lunch and now they...

"Not the best but the staff is so nice (unusual in BJ) it adds one more star to the place. We used to go for lunch every week and finish uni homework, sometimes the waiters even would helps us with it. At night you can grab some affordable drinks and finish the night at Propaganda.","5 из 5 кружков","E98F39A258BC6A4686E4CB2CDD14AD58","Отзыв написан 3 сентября 2016"
"I have seldom had a bad time at La Bamba. They imitate Mexican cuisine as well as probably a Beijing restaurant can do. Their nachos and quesadillas rival any college bar in the US, but obviously fall short of more authentic Mexican restaurants. As mentioned, it's fun and lively. The staff are happy and attentive and the young crowd play...

"I fell in love with La Bamba and it will have a place in my heart forevermore. The food is good (as far as bar food goes), the service is good, the waiters are super-friendly, but really the atmosphere is what makes the place. Any night of the week you can go and have a great time.","5 из 5 кружков","9569924D2BB2F7AFA29D842490BCBDBC","Отзыв написан 1 июля 2016"
"I’ve been to La Bamba many times and sometimes the waiters are super nice and friendly and other times they are nonexistent. However, at a restaurant/bar, do we really care about service? You want to know about the alcohol and food. I don’t drink but my friends do drink and they DO NOT like the alcohol here at all but...

"Oh I love this place.. The chips and Salsa are good for your soul. I travel 2 hours once or twice a month to come here. One of my neighbors comes here once a week and buys enough takeout to sustain her until the next visit.","5 из 5 кружков","E455ECD6FC90968B5B09272A5B2F1CCF","Отзыв написан 25 марта 2016"
"Located in the university area, La Bamba is the place to go if you're looking for cheap food while hanging out with your friends. The waiters speak good English and they have deals offered every day. Accept the offer for member card to enjoy the discount. And since the frequent visitors are student, prepare yourself for some loud convo.","3 из 5 кружков","29E52C43641D4F923631416E2B1360B3","Отзыв написан 12 марта 2016"
"This place is cheap, fun and lively, but the alcohol is a bit odd. Stick to bottled beer with a distinctive taste, e.g. Hoegarden, and you'll be ok. Service is very hit and miss.","4 из 5 кружков","BF7F87A14B800B30B8FE5C43A4885A4E","Отзыв написан 17 января 2016"
"I'm Mexican and I'm in shock, so far from home and I can find so delicious food, not exactly Mexican but seriously this guys are committed to give you good dishes. Staff friendly and the place comfortable and well located. You should try it.","5 из 5 кружков","6DC58CD8514D13B16E8FC02BB83758D3","Отзыв написан 7 мая 2015"
"Three levels of great Mexican food (by Chinese standards). The waiters are very helpful. Place is clean. Lots of smoke and in the evenings, lots of noise from college kids. Large screen TV for games and a pool table. Only squatty potties. Get a discount card for even cheaper eats. Best time to go is lunchtime.","5 из 5 кружков","FEA48FD25BC0D61BEBD9C650130B4C9B","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2014"
"This place is famous because of its offers for students (burrito for 15rmb, burger for 15rmb) but what you get is even less than what you pay: disgusting plastic bread, who knows where the meat come from (if it's meat) and of course fake alcohol!!!! So be aware, AVOID this place","1 из 5 кружков","05EB6788CB8A8ED2BFBFF1EA8E15DE91","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2014"
"La Bamba is for sure a great place to have a drink, the staff there is extremely nice and friendly and the music is quite nice although very outdated. They serve awesome and huge chicken/beef nachos. The rest of the food is also ok. Recommended!","4 из 5 кружков","2EBB784E9CAD830AAD89CBC41453CCD3","Отзыв написан 6 ноября 2014"

"La Bamba is a nice place. Here you can meet a lot of foreign students in Beijing. There are different kind of food and drink. It's usually crowded, but I think that it can be a way to meet lots of people... is not that bad!","3 из 5 кружков","5B8E544A29DCF98FFABCD85C264AD851","Отзыв написан 2 июля 2013"

"Not authentic, of course, and the alcohol is most likely fake, but what the hell. Couldn't ask for more for a price like that. Stay away from their mojito though, it is really wack and costs a fortune for such bad quality. Guacamole is also a hit or miss.","4 из 5 кружков","7316D22A9472198B76145C9ACC5E738C","Отзыв написан 30 сентября 2012"

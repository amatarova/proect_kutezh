"Coming from the NYC area, I have had my fair share of pizza. Many have disappointed me, but occasionally you come across a pizza parlor/restaurant that really surprises you. La Pizza is one such place. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and overall quality of the pizza. The sauce has a bit of a zest to it, which really...

"We savoured a grand dinner at this busy eatery. Arriving without reservations we got an immediate table. We began with arancini and ravioli. Next we opted for a fish dish and a steak. Accompanied by Chinese beer these were all very tasty. We were tempted by the desserts and availed from the choice. The staff were great, friendly and helpful....

"Although the food is good, the waiters' attitude is unacceptable. They give you more than you ordered and when you ask them to take back what you didn't order, they start becoming aggressive and literally shouting at you, trying to force you to pay for the non ordered food! I never had such a bad experience in any other restaurant...

"Recently, Beijing's price inflation has hit most of our local businesses, and La Pizza is not an exception. Rations became smaller, but offering the same taste (thanks for that...) always. Service is OK, wine selection is OK but little overpriced. You can find this restaurant next to 3.3 Plaza (between Sanlitun Village Sections 1 and 2), just follow that small...

"I reviewed La Pizza at Sanlitun before and said the quality was deteriorating.It was not as bad as last time. The food area is closed with high glass windows. A/C keeps you comfortable on hot Beijing days. You can clearly see that this place has a European touch. Service is ok. We had croquettes (fried mashed potatoes), a mixed green...

"I came here with my daughter for a spot of lunch; the greeting was nice, they used Italian (and it seems our Chinese waiter spoke more than just a tiny bit), we sat by the window and looked at the extensive menu. She chose the spaghetti pomodoro whilst I opted for the chicken salad. the draught beer came quickly (Stella,...

"honestly, I don't know how other restaurants manage to sell what they call pizza, all terribly trying to copy the successes of Pizza Hut or Papa John. those cakes with tomatoes and cheese shouldn't even be called pizza (but rather tomato cake). Here you can taste what resembles most what a pizza should be. Unfortunately the restaurant isn't as good...

"Pizza here was good. Probably the nicest one I have had in China, although admittedly that is not many (and most were terrible!). The restaurant itself is similar to most others in the area, being clean and fairly well staffed. The service was good. I would describe it as good for China and perfectly acceptable by western standards as well.","3 из 5 кружков","AED99DBFEFD6F4E69ACAFC0F942A0F32","Отзыв написан 17 июня 2016"

The pasta was with too much tomato and the pizza not really good. It was topped with a lot of tomato as well and not well cooked.

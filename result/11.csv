"Would definitely recommend trying out this restaurant - I had the speciality - Beijing duck which was lovely. In fact, their menu is really extensive and it all looks delicious. I definitely could spend hours sampling the menu. A really good place to go with friends or your partner for a lovely civilised evening.

Would definitely go back the next time I visit.

The staff are really attentive and speak English so it made it easier to order and ask questions. They help explain what everything is and provide an excellent service. Thank you - look forward to the next time.","5 из 5 кружков","D1A90F74608F4C2FD7909D140F1E48DE","15 марта 2017"
"The Dadong group of Beijing restaurants have been famous for the best Peking Duck in Beijing for decades now and that reputation in my view is well-deserved. Delicious, succulent, and consistent is the caliber of food I have had in the many times I have eaten here over the last six years.","5 из 5 кружков","78659DC8BA086FAE490FABDF86CAACC2","14 марта 2017"
"I went there once and that is enough. The place is highly commercial and is like a roast duck factory and the services like an assembly line. It lacks character and taste essential for fine dining experience. You just go there for a good duck for a price you can afford and gets no more than what you bargain for. I have tried plenty of places that can do better in Beijing.","3 из 5 кружков","10BB15BDB3D7384F388A72F58887A558","13 марта 2017"

"Was working in China over the summer, family came visit. We decided to try this restaurant because it was recommended for its duck. Anyway when we looked through the menu we were quite alarmed and unnerved because of how fusion-y and unconventional it all looked.

Good Chinese food doesn't normally mix well with new school.

Anyway when food did arrive, all of it was very well done, whether new or old style dishes. The duck was very well done, not phenomenal but good. We booked our own private room so service was good.","5 из 5 кружков","8C686B58F092B4D75256B902B2B00276","3 марта 2017"

"The roast duck is Beijing's signature dish. we were recommend come to Dadong roast duck restaurant. The duck is carved out in front of the table. You can take the skeleton home or ask the restaurant to use it to cook some soup for you. Price wise it's more then affordable about 50usd for a full duck with all the sides.","4 из 5 кружков","AFEE80559D390C2C36794D8E23792031","13 февраля 2017"

"Chef Dong has created a very creative way to serve Peking (roasted) Duck. The restaurant serves both traditional duck and low-fat duck in a very beautiful and cheerful setting. The menu is very extensive with picture to match the meals. Rhe service is excellent with the waiters carving out the duck and serving the pancakes and accouterments in a very friendly and helpful way. Highly recommended for both the duck and the extensive menu. Luch is a better option.","5 из 5 кружков","CFD0D22599ED29C1C0BF95747077AE1F","14 марта 2017"

"Wow the presentation of my 1st time of having Perking Duck.
The 24 hour preparation of this incredible meal was amazing! I would highly recommend Dadong for Perking Duck!
With your meal you will have all the sides to put together the pancake with the Duck.
Also served is Duck soup, black sesame soup a bowl of sweet tiny tangerines and to end it with a cotton candy with a fruit surprise in the middle. Yummy","5 из 5 кружков","E6F33E980938B22E3B522C7EDE1C1FED","Отзыв написан 16 января 2017"

"We dined at Dadong Roast Duck in December 2016. Let me first state that I am not a huge fan of duck but it was my significant other's birthday and I booked it because I knew he would love it. I ordered a chicken dish and it was spectacular. He ordered the VIP Roast Duck. The duck was carved at the table and the process was almost mesmerizing. The chef used great precision in carving the duck and carefully arranged it on plates. There was also a plate of side which could be used with a won ton wrapper to roll the duck with various vegetables. Since the chef prepared 2 plates I felt obligated to try it. OMG! Those were the first words out of my mouth. The skin on the duck was to die for. It literally melted in your mouth and had a sweet flavor. I successfully polished off half of the duck (and I am not a duck fan, remember?) and wished I had more. It was the off-season when we visited and the restaurant was still very busy and a reservation was required. The service was also worth noting. Our waiter did not speak English and we did not speak Chinese. He was very helpful in showing us what to do with the items on the side dish platter. I also feel that the meal was cheap! I know that many people stated that they felt it was very expensive. We had the VIP Duck, a chicken dish, and multiple beers for a mere $59USD. We live in the Florida Keys and would have paid over $250 for such a dish. Overall: Great food Great Service, Great Value!","5 из 5 кружков","E5976FAD05FB0B8F7C4DC003EA2AD5D5","Отзыв написан 8 января 2017"
"While in Beijing, we have indulged in our great fondness of Roast Duck, in my opinion the flagship of local cuisine. 7 ducks in as many days, a near addiction!
The comparison between several recommended duck places is extremely interesting, and instructive.
Roast duck at Dadong is definitely good, surely expensive, but by no means the best around. The restaurant prides itself in mixing up Chinese tradition and French influence, and that could well be the problem. M. Dong, the famous chef and owner, is pictured with the likes of Ducasse and Robuchon, and prides himself with serving a leaner duck, with less fat under the skin. True, and also true, the bird is crispy and flavorous, but, when looking for a Chinese roast duck, I want to find a Chinese duck, not a French one. Dadong is not La Tour d'Argent. Besides the fraction of the bird that you finally get is a bit minimal for the high price you pay. Out of the seven we tried, Dadong stands low in the ranking. Rest of the food is excellent, and pricey. To me, a drawback is a certain lack of local atmosphere. Decor is cold, and the place lacks the conviviality of some comparable Chinese counterparts.
Is Dadong a good restaurant? Certainly. Is it worth its reputation? Very debatable. Is it the best place for roast duck in town? Definitely not.","3 из 5 кружков","806AD2EE9BF80A4CBF9F708D7C427546","Отзыв написан 4 января 2017"
"Was at Dadong on 25th December 2016 for Christmas dinner. It was not only a wonderful culinary experience but a visually appealing experience as well!

"If you are going to Beijing, you will hear many people tell you that you must try Peking Duck. Dadong is one of the premier places to get Peking Duck, and they do a very good job! The duck is brought out to you and hand-carved at your table. The waiter will also show you how to eat it the traditional way, if you ask (wrapped up in a little pancake with seasonings). This was far and away the most expensive meal that we had in Beijing, but the experience was worth it. The restaurant was clean, the service was prompt, and the food good. We got a whole duck, a side of eggplant, and two glasses of wine for $80 USD. Compared to street food, the prices are outrageous, but the duck is truly delicious. The waiters don't speak that much English, but the menus all have pictures, so it shouldn't be a problem.
I also highly recommend the eggplant sauteed with garlic, it was incredible.","4 из 5 кружков","0C016E7185ECEF59EA594D306B97C06B","Отзыв написан 30 декабря 2016"
"We had a long wait as we hadn't booked a table but there was plenty of people watching to be done as this is a popular, crowded restaurant. We eventually moved up the queue as we agreed to sit at a large communal table, which is not our usual style but let us see what locals were ordering and we met some interesting people. The duck was lean and crispy and amongst the best we have tasted in Beijing, although similar is available cheaper and in a less frantic environment. We enjoyed it but wouldn't rush back.","3 из 5 кружков","A5EC6F83021BC42874CA47CA0EA2C398","Отзыв написан 29 декабря 2016"
"Unfortunately no picture of the duck but the skin was perfectly suckling, juicy and crispy.

The great!
-duck was the highlight and they give everyone individual dipping sauce plate (see photo)

-they gave us a frozen Hawthorne dessert that is slightly sweet and sour.... which is super refreshing. I wish they gave it earlier to cleanse the palate after eating the duck

- very classy oriental decor

The okay stuff-
- portion is fairly small and expensive, each dish comes s/m/l sizes.... the clear glass noodles (see pic) we ordered was around 150 rmb for a small plate which is crazy converting back to CAD.

The bad-
- it seems common to put out dessert as an appetizer not at the very end. It was confusing when to start eating it. They were all nice snacks but nothing special.

- the menu (see photo) is a big book. It was quite intimidating. No one helps you on ordering and so we took a picture of every item when we decided.

- service exists for ""visible foreigners"", if you look Asian, service is kind of hit and miss at times. You don't have a set server for your table, it's whoever u catch. They never come around to check on food taste/refill water. If they do, it's a rough pour. I'm always amazed how the hot tea never splatters given how they look so nonchalant about it. They also don't smile.

A family friend has been here three times and she loves it saying the chain has put very innovative items on the menu that you don't see elsewhere. I agree on the innovation, disagree on the value to taste.

Overall I'm glad I tried the new blockbuster duck in Beijing but I wouldn't go back. The whole high class experience between food taste, quality and dining experience is mismatched.","3 из 5 кружков","FC1FF9F2F40EA3EFA05CD9205155F69E","Отзыв написан 21 декабря 2016"

"The duck here is of course delicious. I love all of the condiments used to make the little duck wraps into a sort of Chinese taco. The chef carving table side is a nice touch as well. The price is very reasonable compared to a similar meal in the States.

"This restaurant was amazing!! Desserts were over the top! I was a pastry chef who had worked for 4 James Beard award winning chefs and I have to say, this place knows what they are doing. Food and atmosphere were great! It may have helped that we were there with someone from Beijing who spoke Chinese. The foie gras cherries are not to be missed. Wagyu steak with sea salt and lime melted in your mouth. Chocolate truffle dessert (little chocolate ducks filled with truffle with real truffles) is also a must. Lobster and red bean pasta was delicious! And of course the Peking duck was the best! Also try the white chocolate shells for a fun dessert.","5 из 5 кружков","3CC3AF08113115D6926A1F6463471F75","Отзыв написан 10 декабря 2016"

"Was there with a colleague and we ordered the usual roast duck, dumplings and more. Roast duck was ok, condiments cost RMB12 per person and the dumplings was not as good as I expected it to be with the price. Ambience is beautiful and the many horses inside will keep the photo lovers very happy. The drinks at the bar while waiting for your table is also comprehensive and I might add that they do have a better bar selection then most places I have been as well... overall, a great place for romance if it is in the air....","3 из 5 кружков","FDB73DD4EDBB294524FD0D5BD092DFE9","Отзыв написан 7 декабря 2016"

"This restaurant looks very fancy, so we thought our bill for 4 was going to be an arm and a leg, but it was only $170. We ordered A LOT of food, 2 mixed drinks, a sofa, flat and sparkling water, duck, dim sum, dumplings, ""snacks,"" salad, soup, some other dishes, and we did not finish most of it. I think you could probably feed 4 people for about $120. Pretty reasonable for such a nice looking, fancy place :)","4 из 5 кружков","304089F2D37CA621E137FBBF44557130","Отзыв написан 2 декабря 2016"
"Group of six pre cruise venture to Dadong for apeking duck. Very difficult when you no know the lingo and get one of the most complicated menu books ever,, so big and so much. We just wanted these special ducks with pancakes and trims and of course a beer. We only ordered two, we thinks that what they recommended. Big mistake, this fabulous duck just disappeared. We needed four, no doubt but too late.

"Peking Duck is a must have here, and you get the complete experience with the chef, in full white chef's garb (including hat), at the table with his super sharp duck slicing knife. A great show and the resulting duck and pancakes is perfectly pleasant, but not the shredded duck you might be used to from the west (which I must say I prefer). Other dishes also beautifully presented and service was very attentive. All felt a little soulless to me though, despite the high quality of food and service.","4 из 5 кружков","C882A553765A950C627A6D7F0F644D82","Отзыв написан 27 ноября 2016"
"Terrible service!!! We were ushered in by a disinterested waitress. Our table wasn't laid out. This was one of the top things we were looking forward to in Beijing. We were given the menus, we were deciding what to order for drink, appetizers and of course the duck. The waitress comes to us and asked us what duck do you want? We figured duck would take time to roast so we were being asked to order that before hand. We ordered the duck and were looking through the menu to order appetizers and drinks. Voila 5 mins later I noticed a movement behind me and the guy had started carving our roasted duck. We were at first confused since our drink orders were not taken and no one asked if we wanted to order anything else. We told the waitress that she hadn't taken our complete order. Her response was you wanted duck right? At that point we were too pissed to order anything else, we ate what was in front of us, paid for it and left. I won't comment on the food because it does not matter after being treated like this. We are tourists and new to China, we have eaten at a lot of local places during our visit. This is the first time I have seen such a terrible service, in fact this takes the top spot of being the worst restaurant experiences ever!!!

"Without doubt, the roast duck at Dadong's restaurant is world class. The duck is perfectly cooked and sliced, and the crispy skin is so spectacular that my mouth is watering while I am writing this review. The restaurant and service are terrific, but the undisputed highlight is the duck. I read that a Dadongs will be opening in New York City. Get ready New York!

"After a day walking @ the great Wall I asked if our guide could recommend us a good place for Peking duck. He advised us Dadong and made a reservation for us.

The restaurant has a fancy and expensive look. We ordered the duck menu. We ordered one whole duck which costed around 289 yuan.

Together with a massive 500ml hoegaarden beer and side dishes, it costed us in total 392 yuan. And best part we got soup, desert and fruit included.

Nice thing about the service was that @ our table they cut the duck and showed us how to properly prepare your duck for eating.

After dinner they were kindly to explain us how to find our way back to the hotel.

I had a good time and if you are in Beijing, check Dadong out.","5 из 5 кружков","750AC7487969508002857B054761356F","Отзыв написан 15 ноября 2016"

They show you the duck before analyzing and preparing it. The taste is delicious, eat it with garlic, sugar or a kind of chocolate sauce, with pancakes, bread or with vegetables. I think we had an excellent meal for a decent price (400 yuan for two persons, inclusing 4 chinese white beers. Service was a little shy.

"I was taken to this restaurant by my Chinese host because he claimed it served the best Peking duck in Beijing. We ate in a private room. The menu was amazing, all the dishes were contained in a thick book with photos so you could easily understand what you were ordering.

The service was excellent. What I found intriguing was the very artistic style of the dishes. Some similarities to French cuisine in the imagination and way in which the dishes were presented. There was one which was just like a Christmas scene, with small cubes of meat forming a small hill and fine grain sugar lightly dusted over it.

The Peking duck was superb.

I have no idea of the costs but certainly the restaurant was packed when we arrived and left. I guess that reservations are essential anytime. We ate on a Monday evening and the host said he had ordered the Peking duck and made the reservation 2 days previously.","5 из 5 кружков","749DECDC1D02FEBCD219CF8BE328696A","Отзыв написан 5 ноября 2016"

"We wanted a Peking Duck experience while in Beijing and we got it at Da Dong. Note that there are several Da Dong Roast Duck restaurants (not sure if it's the Chinese equivalent of a chain?), so pick the one that is closest to your hotel. The only real downside to the one that we went to was the lights were very bright (my wife called them interrogation lights) inside the restaurant. They could do with a dimmer switch to give it a little better atmosphere.","4 из 5 кружков","82AC672FE56C77BAC84D1EC636FEF7C6","Отзыв написан 2 ноября 2016"

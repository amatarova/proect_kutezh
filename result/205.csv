"Colleagues of mine took me there for a diner. Very good Chinese dishes, often more or less spicy Service is correct and discrete","5 из 5 кружков","2E8A23D8B53242FFC78EDCD53047E588","3 марта 2017"
"Boiling Fish and Tofu are not bad . Highly recommended by the hotel concierge but was expecting better food...","2 из 5 кружков","790E7666625704552FD329528C256CEF","Отзыв написан 23 октября 2016"
"Decent food bordering on the spicy. Had the Peking duck which was ok. The fragrant ginger chicken is really good. Tried the <U+6C34><U+716E><U+9C7C> and found it overwhelming- but maybe it's just me. Would recommend if you are staying in the area. They do have private rooms, though the place can get a little noisy even on a weekday night.","3 из 5 кружков","01ACC274547AFF0B6C139456DFD5083E","Отзыв написан 10 июля 2016"
"Delicious food but very hard to find if you don't speak Chinese. Here are some tips for non locals: - Save the name and address in Chinese as we didn't find anyone who could read the English name or address - the building isn't where it says it is on trip advisor map (the address is correct I think). We...

"There were @ 39 of us and we visited as part of a guided trip through China. We had the usual Chinese banquet which was very nice but so much food, it's never ending. A good atmosphere and service.","4 из 5 кружков","F9DA058563BB57363832826AA07B6C8A","Отзыв написан 8 ноября 2015"
"We arrived after a long day travelling and met some very old friends for dinner here. They pre-ordered the duck (which was amazing). The building is entered through this awesome tardis like structure! The food was great - noodles, beef with basil and garlic, sweet chicken and mushrooms like I've never eaten. Will be back","5 из 5 кружков","3115BE0100A7FC2D040A5ED1CC558F84","Отзыв написан 25 июня 2015"
"This was a gem during our visit to Beijing, truly amazing dishes both spicy and non-spicy. Good for a small group so that you can try multiple dishes. Inside the wantong commercial building (in the basement).","5 из 5 кружков","D6A0598D86686F14C60BA790230D6B3E","Отзыв написан 4 июня 2015"
"Some local friends have taken me to Madam Zhu<U+00B4>s Kitchen. While it is a little hidden on the base floor of an office building - the setting and the food is really nice. Great selection of freshly prepared dishes. No surprise that the Beijing Duck was prepared well as well. Good service. A full recommendation.","5 из 5 кружков","137B16743C0CAE7FE6010B07CB69D96C","Отзыв написан 19 мая 2015"
"Madame Zhu's kitchen is a perfect place to have extremely tasty food coming from all over China for a very decent price! We were a big group and we paid about 130 RMB per person including drinks (beers) and dessert (tofu ice-cream), lots and lots of super tasty dishes (you should definitely take the big fish, out of this world...

"We were invited to this restaurant by a Chinese friend and were really surprised at the quality of the food. Almost all of the customers were Chinese but the menu is bilingual and is extensive. We had the shrimp, beef and mushroom and tofu dish - all excellent. The restaurant serves very modern Chinese fusion dishes and we highly recommend...

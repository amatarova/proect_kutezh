"Naturally coloured and lovely flavours! Quaint and very basic interior but with it's own charms. I must say something about having diverse coloured dumplings just make it extra tasty!","5 из 5 кружков","150ED5DB906532707F0D0D23154CA5C1","7 марта 2017"
"Where to begin. Welcoming staff (on the Beijing scale a 10+) some English spoken and the menu is decipherable with lots of pictures. Certainly have dumplings, but also explore the other menu for tasty Chinese standards. Don't expect much decor, but the dishes are rock solid. The colored dumplings are fun while not affecting the taste. Amazingly inexpensive, dumplings until...

"I eat at this restaurant fairly regularly and it is one of my favorite places to take friends and family when they come to visit Beijing. They sell amazing coloured dumplings in a whole host of different colours and types. The food is cheap and the restaurant is always buzzing. It is a happy medium and balance between authentic local...

"Love this place as it does not use mono sodium glutamate. You'll find a lot of natives there, (menu is also in English) or airliners who happen to know about this place.

"This place is great for dumplings as well as all of the favourite foreigner dishes. They have a purple coloured dumpling with pork and crispy rice that I always get. To tell the truth, I could go there and only eat these dumplings. Gong Bao Ji Ding is good as well. People will tell you it's pricey, but good Chinese...

"The range, colour and flavour of the dumplings is simply awesome. These are some of the best I've ever had, I'd thoroughly recommend anyone visiting Beijing to take a trip here. We also had green beans and a spinach dish which were equally as delicious, very good prices too for the quality and great atmosphere.","5 из 5 кружков","7419865AA62391DD75D7D45D71EC123E","Отзыв написан 19 ноября 2016"
"A friend brought me here for lunch and apparently this is the place in Beijing for dumplings. I had the house special (purple), lamb (orange), and the green dumplings, plus a spicy cabbage dish with tiny shrimp and noodles, and an eggplant dish. They were all fantastic, and only 20 bucks for the two of us. Don't miss it!","5 из 5 кружков","3C9D9E77A32E7D54C2998D7A5D841FF3","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"

"It's a fantastic place for dumplings at good prices--you could order so many! Although I speak Chinese, I can't imagine it being too difficult for non-Chinese speakers--they have a picture menu with English for those who can't read Chinese, and the dumplings are delicious, although some can be slightly unusual. They're also beautiful, thanks to the vegetable dye that turns...

"If you like dumplings- the place is for you! They are tasty and with variety of fillings. Other dishes are quite nice as well.

"This place is very popular with expats, due in no small part to the picture menu, english translations, and the local atmosphere. The dumplings are the big draw, but I think their execution is better with the dry fried green beans, the la zi ji, and (if in season) the water spinach. Dumpling stuffing options are very wide, but I...

"If there is a mixture of filling you can't find here, it probably doesn't exist. The variety is huge. The taste is just ok and the service is typical Chinese, which is to say not particularly good.

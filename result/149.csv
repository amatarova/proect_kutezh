"Following a negative experience at the Shang Palace in early Nov 2016 the management of the Shangri La immediately reached out to constructively discuss the event. Their efforts and focus on customer service seeking to rectify the experience were exemplary of what in particular I have always valued most about the Shangri La — their focus on customer service.

"A colleague and I went for dinner to Shang Palace (on 2F at the Shangri La) while staying at the hotel. We arrived at 8pm and were greeted by a hostess giving the impression of being rather annoyed that she had to deal with guests arriving. We inquired if there was availability for a table for 2 for dinner and...

"This restaurant has always been one of the pillar of excellence particularly in this side of Beijing and since they introduce the roast duck from Yuen Shifu, it has become the piece de resistance. The dim sum here is also good particularly when you get to combine it with the duck! So all in all, I give it a 5...

"We had what was supposed to be a quick lunch and feasted upon a choice collection of dim sum and various types of dumplings with vinegar dipping sauce. They were all so good that we ended up eating way too much (and staying much longer than planned!)... Whenever I stay in the Shangri-La hotel there is little reason to go...

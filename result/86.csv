"This is an upmarket restaurant located in a 5 star hotel aimed at the guy with the Lamborghini out the front. It has prices to match. Despite the price it certainly delivers with 4 different types of salt, perfect bread and your choice of a dozen steak knifes. Service is brilliant and the ambience great. My meal was great. The...

"We visited The Cut for dinner and have enjoyed the food a lot. The Cesar salad for starter was good but of course the highlight was the meat for mains. Excellent meat, grilled exactly to the point we ordered it. Besides the price, which is high even for that level of quality of steak the real downturn was the service....

"We were very attracted by the menu : very simple, elegant and yet offering a wide variety of different food. We both ordered steak with different starters, and we both enjoyed the food very much.

"We ordered a whole duck at the time of booking and when we arrived they didn't seem to have any recollection of it! When the duck finally came we were not given the whole duck just part of it! When we questioned this we were told 'our ducks are small' this was not a small duck!! The food was nice...

"This restaurant is located in the Lido area, therefore it is a bit more stylish then usual Chinese restaurant. Nevertheless it is still traditional style and very beautiful. Dishes are very good and have sometimes a slight western touch e.g. roasted duck is served with sweet chutney but not too much (Because I love real Chinese food :-) ) A...

"The service pretty good, minus the fact that the buzzer on the table a) didn't work or b) was ignored. I pressed it 3 times and no one came until I called. The food a Chinese fusion was acceptable. It wasn't that amazing to be honest. The atmosphere was top notch though, with indoor and outdoor seating!!","4 из 5 кружков","E47A10AAA7EE52C02CC2DD140452D912","Отзыв написан 22 августа 2016"
"Located in the Lido arena with both indoor and outdoor seating Wish is an excellent fusion restaurant. The prices are higher average and it is justified by the presentation on the plates and the taste.

"I visited Wish already the second time. The location near Xiaoyun bridge is good. The restaurant has a nice, stylish atmosphere. You find several small rooms which are connected. The service is outstanding good. The food was excellent especially the baked oysters and the sole. Also the wine list offers a basic selection of international wines. The highlight at Wish...

"Chinese restaurant food in the formal setting used to be so memorable, tasty and exciting. Now this so called fusion food - code for less effort and cost in the food and excess on the decor seems to be all the rage. My advice look for something traditional.","3 из 5 кружков","8AFF59571440887D867889CF8B7C72DA","Отзыв написан 1 сентября 2015"

"Really enjoyed dinner. Outside the ambience is relaxed and friendly. Inside decor is very interesting and feels similar. The service was prompt and timings perfectly judged. Good portions and without fail all dishes tasted great. Staff are attentive but you don't notice them until you need them.

"this place could have been in SF or NYC, but this is meant in a good way. Small portioned plates, almost tapas-style. Asian with a twist. We ordered foie gras (banned in my home state of California now), a waldorf-style salad (just OK), one dungeness crab (a little disappointing, not recommended), pork belly which was outstanding and a spicy chicken...

"When you are in China/Beijing you want to visit a traditional chinese restaurant. And you should. However this one is also a must on your list. Combine the traditional chinese food with the over the top modern feel of the chinese and you get Wish.... Great decoration, a bit over the top but not too much, nice seating, live jazz/lounge...

The layout provides a good atmosphere for business discussion or romantic dinners with loved ones. I did not order the food but thoroughly enjoyed the dishes. I particularly enjoyed the fish main course. It was cooked to perfection....

"Visst, hot pot ar hot pot men detta staller tillfor lite extra framfor allt pa upplevelsesidan.
Forst ska man vara beredd pa vantetid, vi fick sitta ca 30 minuter men de har bord for vantan med spel, lite snacks och te. Man kan ga ivag med om man vill, eller ta manikyr.
Sedan nar vi fick bordet var det full rulle, in pa plats, dukar over jackor, bestalla grytor (tog en stark och en mild - ja stark AR jattestark har), lite blandade kott/gronsaker/skaldjur, ga blanda sin sas och sedan vanta pa grytorna blev varma. Servitrisen som tog in oss till platserna och hjalpte till med bestallningen pratade ok engelska, killen som sedan kom och hjalpte till da och da med lagrandet pratade inte alls men gick bra anda - han fixade pa och lite teckensprak sa loste det sig. Personalen ar vanliga och stottande men om man ska saga nagot neg ar det att de alltid ar pa sprang. En av grejerna med stallet ar just att de ar populara och har (vill ha) bra genomstromning pa besokarna.

Nagra tips: ratterna pa menyn t.ex en portion ""assorted meat"" ar ganska stora, vi bestallde typ 5-6 olika saker men pa de flesta tog vi ""half plate"" vilket ar lagom om man ar tva som vi var. Och ja, bestall nudlarna oavsett om du tanker ata dem eller inte, skoj mini-show. Sist men inte minst, lat er inte stressas av att personalen (som ar goa och glada) haller ett hogt tempo utan ta det i er egen takt och njut av en normalt god hot-pot.","5 из 5 кружков","B1935DDFD0B23C69BF9137D21C09C493","14 марта 2017"
"Haidilao Hot Pot has had a reputation for being one of the best chain store Hot pot restaurants in Beijing for many years now. Great service and very good food. I recommend you try it if you want to have some authentic Chinese cuisine while you're in Beijing.","4 из 5 кружков","7BD8DF5BA01E6A6D18BF0EEE4D405B45","10 марта 2017"
"Now we did read that the place was hard to find, and we did struggle to find it. But with the help of the mapsme app we found the general location then used our detective work to figure out it was on the top floor of the shopping mall we were standing (freezing cold) outside of, after having walked around the mall a few times. When we got inside there was a huge queue and an even bigger designated waiting area with chairs and tables and even a serviced nail bar for those of you that want to beautify yourself before you eat. We were seated at the waiting area for about 45mins and were given a few nibbles and drinks while we waited.

We've never done a hot pot before, but we have done a few steamboats in our time... apparently they're not the same thing.
We don't speak a word or mandarin, however the staff were still so helpful when they could see us struggling. It was a lot of fun, very good quality food and a taste of their famous face changing for some light entertainment made the night one to remember.
You have to order the dancing noodles, you won't regret it!","5 из 5 кружков","CDF65610CFFCD2C0D4BCE80078576DCF","6 марта 2017"
"How amazing this place can be?
Certainly the best hot pot ever in my life.
This time they had a seasonal dish: rolls or lamb and fish. Wow! Flavor was out of this world.
Amazing service. Amazing food.
Spicy flavors are a challenge so be careful.","5 из 5 кружков","CA62D25E021FC36DF74BD4364950674A","4 марта 2017"
"This hot pot establishment had amazing service! The waitress gave us hair ties, blankets to cover our belongings, and recommendations for the sauce station. Everything on the menu looked delicious and came out very fresh. We ordered beef, pork, fen shi, and several vegetable dishes. The spicy hot pot was quite spicy, so it's not for the weak of heart. This is great for large groups because you can try more of the menu! The cost was also only around $15-$20 USD, which was great value for our money.","5 из 5 кружков","5EB6CAB074796D6F7F75780860CDEC33","3 марта 2017"

"Sono stato con la mia famiglia in questo ristorante seguendo le ottime recensioni di TripAdvisor e devo dire che non sono assolutamente rimasto deluso! Personale molto gentile e disponibile anche se non parla inglese. In pratica si scelgono i cibi crudi e li si cuociono in un brodo (che si puo scegliere e puo essere di due tipi diversi, noi abbiamo preso pomodoro e funghi) che viene posto in mezzo al tavolo. Piatto tipico della citta, davvero ottimo. Prezzi medi (50euro in 4 mangiando molto!!!).
Assolutamente da provare!!! Attenzione che c'e molta gente normalmente (quasi tutti abitanti del posto) ma l'attesa vale la cena!","5 из 5 кружков","07B3425D833EF99EFAB2203A6CA97908","22 февраля 2017"

"We have been here 5 years ago and The taste is not changing since then, we were there around 8pm while the outside temperature was -3 degrees Celcius, so it was a good time to have the hotpot. It a must try Hotpot Restaurant in Beijing and you won't regret it. The Resto always packed with the diners all the time eventhough it opens for 24 hours. We must wait about 45 minutes to have a table for 4 of us. The soup and meat was so nice, also the sauces and condiments buffet so many, try their house specialities sauce. We love it so much. Try it and you will not regret it. A bit pricey but worth it.","5 из 5 кружков","C4998BEBF3E6FAE8020D0A47D9B736A3","20 февраля 2017"

"My mom and I visited this place twice because it was such a nice place.

We had to wait for 40 minutes the first time and 1 hour the next time. I guess it is very common for this place so be prepared to wait. We almost didn't want to the first time we were there but I guess they can't do faster. The host/welcoming waiter said sorry a lot of times and gave us a giftcard to one portion free vegetables.

You can choose to walk around and come back at a decided time or wait in the 'waiting area'. Both times we just decided to walk around and come back because there is so much to see on Wangfujing Street.
But we could see that there was free drinks (cold tea), small snacks (nuts/chips) and you could ask for brickgames, free shoe shining and a place to get your nails done. But because we went for a walk, we didn't use that and cannot say if it was good/bad.

But once you get a table the food is excellent, it is fun to try and the waiters are very serviceminded, smiling and friendly. Even though it looked like we were the only 'non-chinese' we felt us so welcome.

The first time our personally waiter called for the 'welcoming waiter' who could speak more English. She helped us with the booking which was on an iPad. Also, she guided us a bit through the hot pot-concept.
After a while we think the manager of the restaurant came and showed us the 'buffet' of sauces, fresh vegetables and fruit and how to mix them. Also she came with forks even though we didn't asked for them - but they could see we wasn't used to chopsticks, so it was very kind of them.

The waiters come by like every 5 minute. But not to disturb. Just to check if everything is okay. Very nice, because it is so nice to order more, ask for something etc. to the waiter. Also the waiter helped us with preparing the food etc. when it was needed even though we didn't asked for it. Only a very few of the waiters spoke English but all the waiters were very friendly and kind and tried there best to understand us.

We paid about 220 CNY for 2 Sprite (600 ml - which is what they call 'small' - not Danish sizes for soft drinks), 1 portion small sausages, 2 portion meat balls, 1 portion pork slices and 1 portion vegetables to put in the pot (enough for 2 people). Also you have the buffet of salad, fruit and sauces. A bottle of 'okay' wine is about 50 CNY. Very cheap compared to eating on restaurant in Denmark.

This is not traditionally Chinese food but very good food and very good service and also a nice try. If you are in Beijing I would really recommend this but prepared to wait. But it is worth waiting for.","4 из 5 кружков","A5F0350800833452BF8FE1B20D1C02DA",""
"Although I have had hotpots before, wanted to try this because it was ranked #5 in Beijing. Had to wait almost 45 minutes to find a seat (they serve snacks/drinks). It did not live up to the high expectation that we had. The reason can be - Visited a hotpot restaurant for the very first time without a Chinese friend.

Staff was helpful in placing the order and food is not bad at all. Sichuan hotpot was very HOOOOOOT!!","4 из 5 кружков","E1F158A9EBB5770C242A14BF56EA856C","Отзыв написан 6 февраля 2017"

"Never been a big fan of chinese food, but ended up liking this place a lot. My bf ordered frogs and pigs brains, I ended up eating tofu, sweet potatoes and beef. The spicy pot isn't that spicy if you're used to eating spicy foods... i.e. indian, thai...

The service and atmosphere were outstanding. Even though we didn't speak any chinese our order was corrent and our waiter was very helpful.","4 из 5 кружков","4DF7150977895723C3ADBE59FEA5C99F","Отзыв написан 27 января 2017"
"Even if you don't know Chinese you will manage to order and eat and enjoy the whole thing, if you take your time.
You choose how spicy one of the hot pot should be and the other one is non spicy. You order meat and vegetables to out inside and wait and eat. They will help you out if you haven't been before and just relax and enjoy. Its great taste and good fun.","5 из 5 кружков","DC28BD487975E74A4E6B33D2A85A97E9","Отзыв написан 25 января 2017"
"A must-go whilst you're in China! You will definitely get the best Hot-pot experience in this restaurant! While you wait for your table, you can play board games and enjoy lots of snacks or you can get your nails done for free (although the queue is insane for that as well).
The service is impeccable, they think of everything: you get a kitchen apron to prevent the stains from crazy boiling hot pot, waterproof bags for phones, charges under the table, elastic bands if you have long hair etc etc etc.
The food is also tasty and diverse! Very impressed!
Highly recommended it!","5 из 5 кружков","FE1100E361CD6A3B35E73224AD9A88FD","Отзыв написан 25 января 2017"
"The restaurant is located at the 8th floor of the ""In 88"" Mall (It's the one with the Prada store at the corner on Wangfujing St.). It was recommended to us, by friends, to try ""Hot Pot"" while in China. We located this restaurant which had positive reviews, and it was conveniently located near our hotel. We tried getting a reservation through our hotel, but they do not accept reservations. So, we walked(10mins!!) over there around 7.30pm on a Saturday evening and we got our names on the w/list - for an 1-hr wait. There is a small number of stuff who speak a little english and with the help of the Google-translate app we were able to understand each-other. Luckily, when we were seated we were served by a very helpful, english-speaking waitress. I can't tell if this happened by chance or by choice, but she guided us through the details of this kind of eating. She helped us order and she helped us pick the matching sauses for our picks. Basically, in hot-pot restaurants, tables have a gas-burning stove in the center where they place a hot-pot. Then, you order various meats, fish or vegies which you boil in one of the soups (the pot is divided in 2 or 4 parts, each with a different soup mix). It is often described as Chinese Fondue. Since I can't stand spicy food, and one of the two soups was ""mildly"" spicy, I eventually had to ""cook"" my items in the non-spicy soup. It was a fun experience, taking into consideration that we were travelling as a family with our 10yo child.","5 из 5 кружков","6F3A314117F115929DD5EBC67BD5D3B0","Отзыв написан 20 января 2017"
"abbiamo trovato questo favoloso ristorante frequentato in maggioranza da cinesi. l'inglese come al solito e poco parlato ma i camerieri sono stati gentilissimi e nonostante le prime difficolta abbiamo mangiato molto bene. scegli cosa vuoi mangiare (hanno un menu con foto dei cibi non cotti) e poi li cuoci al tuo tavolo scegliendo la zuppa base. ottimi sia il pesce che la carne e le verdure. un elogio allo staff gentilissimo e conto veramente basso","5 из 5 кружков","107EA1291BCCE5E42D8BC6600E42B67E","Отзыв написан 14 января 2017"

"We visited Haidilao Hot Pot late December 2016. We waited for about an hour and a half for a table but we expected that because it was the weekend. We ordered the spicy hotpot and the mushroom hotpot. Despite loving spicy food, the spicy broth almost knocked me off my feet. It is not for the weak. Overall, our dinner was great. We really enjoyed the ""noodle man"" that spun the noodles and put on a show at our table. It was a great meal and experience for the price.","5 из 5 кружков","E5976FAD05FB0B8F7C4DC003EA2AD5D5","Отзыв написан 7 января 2017"
"We went to Haidilao Hot Pot restaurant on Wanfujing street on January 4th, 2017. We had read some reviews and wanted to try it. For some reason, on Googlemaps it comes up as ""Wangfujing sea fishing pot"", but it's truly Haidilao. Go into the mall that has Tiffany's and Prada etc and go up to the 8th floor. It's right there.

They are apparently usually lined up quite a bit and the wait time can be hours long. We did not experience that, we waited about 10 minutes. That was a bit unfortunate (!!), because we did not get to enjoy the perks offered to waiting customers: playing board games, getting your nails done and your shoes shined! True fact! I put my name down for having my nails down at 19:30 when we walked in, and by the time we left the restaurant after our meal at 21:15 there still were 4 people ahead of me on the list...

When our turn came to get a table, an English speaking staff came to get us and explain the menu and how to order. However, she REALLY RUSHED US! We had to ask her to stop and slow down numerous time. We had not even taken our jackets off that she was showing us a digital menu on an Ipad and saying ""you want this? You want this one? And this one?"" We did not even really know what hot pot was and what the various options were and she was racing to put our order in though the IPad she was holding. She meant well but it took away from our enjoyment a lot.

All in all, we had a delicious meal with more food that we needed for a total of 200RMB. It was delicious although the rushing and atmosphere were definitely lacking. They didn't ask if we wanted to start with a drink, they did not leave us a minute to look at the menu, they were even putting meat into the hot pot for us! It was delicious but not the date night we had in mind.

Pros: the perks for waiting customers, the half portions for couples (hot pot is more suited to large groups), the price, lots of staff ready to help whenever you need them, the bib they give you to wear during the meal

Cons: The rush (we felt like it was a fast food joint the way everything was ordered and delivered to the table in the blink of an eye and under pressure), the smell on your clothes and hair after you leave, the hot pot is built into the table, it is not one of those beautiful copper ones that sits on top of the table like some other restaurants have.

Note: There are various types/flavors of broth. The spicy one is VERY spicy. I tolerate spicy food very well but this was WAY above my enjoyment threshold.
Order noodles! A boy will come to your table to stretch the noodles in some form of ""Cirque du Soleil performance"" you won't believe!

If you want a relaxing atmosphere for a nice meal out, this is not the place. It's best for large groups, it's loud and it's very busy and stressful being there and ordering while they pressure you to make decisions very fast. If you want to simply experience Chinese hot pot, and possibly enjoy the perks of the waiting lounge, this is a good place.","4 из 5 кружков","6DF325BCBF1EC32A325BA517A8DA391C","Отзыв написан 4 января 2017"
"Whether you like hot pepper/spicy hot pot or just no-spicy hot pot, you should try any one of Beijing Haidilao Restaurant (translating to English - fetching the bottom of the ocean). You can order a split soup base with both Spicy and nonspicy (mushroom) soups and certainly try the prime ribeye slice, Australian lamp slices, fish, and tofu and other items as you like. You can mix your own source or ask for help from the waitress. All the stuff are well trained (very high standard locally), polite, and helpful. You can also pick up the fruits and congee as much as you like. The locals love the restaurants as well. Be careful of your food allergy - point out this to the waitress here who can help you out. The fresh made noodle is also a must - as the chef made the noodle on site.","5 из 5 кружков","F5A4EC10B0DF82B31D3B241152704488","Отзыв написан 2 января 2017"

"I do not usually write reviews for food, but had to in this case due to the warm hospitality I received while my family and I were there.

We went on the eve of Christmas (we tried going on Saturday previously but waited over an hour, but the queue was not really moving). My family and I were taken aback by the warm hospitality that we received at the restaurant - they provide food, manicure services, and other forms of entertainment to entertain you while you wait. I would say that this is the first time that I have received such service before. The staff there were very friendly, especially one female staff, Ms <U+674E><U+6653><U+971E>, who was particularly accommodating and patient.

The food was served really quickly after we had ordered it. We ordered Mala (it's really very spicy even for the least spicy option!) and mushroom base (must try!). We also ordered seafood, meat and some vegetables to complete the meal. Free flow of sauces and tomatoes, among other snacks are available.

Generally, I would advice potential visitors to make a booking before they arrive as the queue can get REALLY long (~20-40 groups ahead of you). Otherwise, visit the shop on the weekdays for a shorter queue.","5 из 5 кружков","7D815647EFC9DE941E5C27E2DAFA5C5B","Отзыв написан 1 января 2017"

You will not leave hungry, as in addition to the hot pot, there are free snacks and fruit for before and after your meal. Sometimes, there is a wait, so they supply you with games, snacks, and drinks, while you wait.

Asi que no entendiamos nada: al llegar te dan un numero y nos pusieron en una mesita con un pica pica para esperar... Dicen el numero por megafonia cuando es tu turno (en chino, claro), por lo que no parabamos de interceptar camareros para preguntar con senas si ya habian dicho el nuestro... Luego fuimos a nuestra mesa y nos dieron una carta toda en chino... Copiamos lo q hacian los de al lado para poder pedir: resulta que pides uno o dos caldos en cuyo interior luego tu mismo cocinas los ingredientes que le quieras anadir! Fuero muy atentos a pesar de no entender ni papa... La cena en si fue super divertida y un gran show!

My guide Sunflower of Sunflower Tours took me to this place and it was spot on! I got to try all the different items she recommended and we had a lovely time. As a beginner I might have been otherwise intimidated although they do have an English menu. Sunflower she rolled right through all the items, picking what was the best to try. We even got to try the fabulous hand tossed noodles and I have a fabulous video on my FB page @carryonforone you can view. Highly recommend!

"Best experience in a restaurant. A waiter/waitress per section (6 or so tables) comes and check on you frequently and there are others going around to serve you the best they can. So cheap, bloated ourselves only on 250 yuan. Food is delicious and waiter helps you and show how to cook. They order on ipad with pictures so easy to get around. You can also order half sized dishes. Must order a noodle (myen) that a noodle chef comes and makes, so entertaining.

"We had a very tight window for dinner as we had tickets for a show. The wait staff worked with the chef to help us order food that could be prepared quickly. Everything was beautifully served and very enjoyable.","5 из 5 кружков","CEDCD18F4EA12F514BCC3504BE23539F","25 февраля 2017"
"The bar was very quiet every time i went, but friendly and comfortable. The restaurant is Spanish themed, but serves a variety of dishes. Food was well presented and the menu will satisfy most tastes.","4 из 5 кружков","CA9E3AFE77142D5BC1EE64E741F15039","Отзыв написан 17 января 2017"

"Absolutely fabulous lunch at Georges Restaurant at Eclat Hotel, Beijing. This is our second Christmas in Beijing. Last year was a disaster at another hotel so we were cautious this year when we booked for Christmas lunch. Georges was a fantastic experience - fine dining at its best. We would highly recommend this restaurant and the hotel is also amazing.","5 из 5 кружков","1A0E7CF7F35B80B576D1392BF7B55771","Отзыв написан 29 декабря 2016"
"During our stay at the Eclat we stopped several evenings at George's bar. Different from the typical wide open space hotel bars, George's is a more intimate and eclectic space. The service was excellent and we enjoyed our drinks. Nice.","5 из 5 кружков","A824569697A2642EAC993F62F3A33686","Отзыв написан 23 декабря 2016"

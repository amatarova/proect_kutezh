"My husbands co worker who is a local recommended this restaurant. Although he had never been it came highly recommend to him. It was a beautiful place. The duck was amazing. So crispy, so juicy.

"12 of us dined here in April. We had a private room. The Beijing Duck was very good although fattier than previous times when have eaten Peking Duck. But the taste was still very good. We had many other dishes which were all good, washed down with copious quantities of 'Pijou'","4 из 5 кружков","DA75E4F6698B8B1959266DE9204F442A","Отзыв написан 23 апреля 2016"
"Work lunch so I did not know what to expect. The decor was amazing, the service efficient and very well organised and the food... Certainly a restaurant you would not visit if you were in a hurry. Best dish? The do a mean tofu for the non meat eaters and for the rest there is duck !","5 из 5 кружков","A0A7778F3EFCE4FD121F4BAADBE86EAC","Отзыв написан 5 ноября 2015"

"there are few of XiHeYaYuan restaurants in town, one is beside Indigo, so be careful when calling to make bookings. the food is very good and as in many Chinese restaurants it is amazing the variety of food you can choose, so my learning for Chinese restaurants it is we should ever go in many people so we can order...

"I came here with colleagues after work as we'd agreed that we should do for ""toasted duck"" somewhere. Although we made reservations, we still needed to wait a good 30 minutes or more for a table. I suspect that reservations don't count for much! The food was all delicious and the serving of the duck a lovely bit of theatre....

"We've eaten at other famous duck restaurants in Beijing, but this is our favorite. The duck is just fantastic, perfectly cooked, and all the accompaniments are terrific. This restaurant's blueberry sauce for the duck is unique. The duck broth served later on and the roast duck bones are outstanding. The service has always been extremely efficient and friendly. We see...

"The best restaurants in town are always recommended by locals...I went to this restaurant because a Chinese fiend described it as his ""favorite Beijing Duck restaurant""...and I did not regret it!

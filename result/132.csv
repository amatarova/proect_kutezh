"Small pizza restaurant in an authentic hutong setting. Good pizza with lots of choices from vegetarian to seafood and of course meat!!! It's two storey hutong and the tables overlooking the fish pond is my preferred place! It has a nice ambiance at night.

"A small local shop in a hidden hutong close to the 'Lotus Market'. Order a big pizza and one can choose a combination of three toppings ! A combo of dessert and drinks comes at an attractive price.

"If Pizza was invented in China and brought to Europe by Marco Polo is a discussion for academics. However if you find the place it's a good place to get a pizza.

"Man, it's hard to find, but is it ever worth it!

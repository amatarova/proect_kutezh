"Went recently on a Saturday night. New Chef and new menu. The menu is sparse relative to the old menu. Pizza gone, Chateaubriand gone, cannot choose side dishes ala carte any longer...The service was first rate as always. The atmosphere is always nice. My impression of the food was not as positive as others have reviewed. I tried the beef...

"Friends wanted to go and try that restaurant. This restaurant tries to be great trendy... long ways Got the 6 courses menu with wine pairing, to try couple different items on the menu. The dishes were small and well presented, unfortunately the chef tries to make a statement with his food but he should stay simple. The agnolotti and the...

"The total experience was perfect. We had arrived from Korea that day and wanted a comfortable meal. The atmosphere and service were perfect. The food was delicious.

"I was pleasantly surprised by my meals at Sureno I had expected bland, western food from what is essentially a hotel lobby restaurant. Sureno turned out to be high quality and served food I would have been happy to find in my hometown of New York City. Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked. The staff was friendly.","4 из 5 кружков","A17A4EFCE2FFC28DE3F416E6E1818C56","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2016"

"After a week in Beijing, there's a certain pleasure to be had in eating Western food again. I came here for a casual dinner, and was impressed by the finesse with which the chef prepared the meals.

"It has been sometimes since my last visit to this restaurant but the quality of food is just as good. The pizza is excellent with that very thin crust that you get in Italy.

"I was lazy and didn't want to go out for dinner in Beijing so opted to eat at Sureno at the opposite house where I am staying. I've eaten here before and don't remember it being so average. But it is just that. Lobster bisque was water and cream. Really awful. Pizza was ok but crusts are pre-made and frozen....

"Great and suprisingly Italian/European food. Last night in Beijing and my business partner brought me here, was about to complain because I did not want Italian inspired food when in Bejing, but happy I didn't. This place is not only stylish it also serves great food.

It's not an inexpensive meal, but the service and quality of the food are absolutely worth the price.

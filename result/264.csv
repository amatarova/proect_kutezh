"Had a lunch and a dinner there while staying at the Fairmont. Very good service, and the Peking Duck was was delicious and serviced with a flair. It is a little pricy, but if you're staying at the Fairmont it's right there in the basement so it's very convenient.","5 из 5 кружков","80B9A028602EDCB4A53A5E463A381C29","Отзыв написан 23 октября 2016"

"We had planned to eat out at one of the better known duck specialty restaurants in Beijing, but after a long day at the great wall and the fact that we had an early flight the next day, we decided to try the duck at Lunar 8 which is one of the main restaurants at the hotel (Fairmont). This was...

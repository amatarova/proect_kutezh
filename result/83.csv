"It was almost 4PM but I have not had my lunch and as I was passing through the hotel corridor, I saw the Kempinski Deli. Since I'm not familiar with the place and I don't want to walk further to find a place where I can have lunch, I decided to have my lunch here. There is a fair selection...

"They serve good breads, have a great deli, sandwiches are decent. Honestly not sure what all the fuss is about, there are quite a number of decent bread places in Beijing now. Even the stuff at April Gourmet is comparable.","4 из 5 кружков","DD3582156229956D714734D6023DC999","Отзыв написан 26 июля 2016"

"As a take-away, this works OK, some of the food is good (although because this place is inside the Kempinski hotel, the prices are on the high side). For eating in it is not to be recommended, because there are too few seats and those that you can find are small and uncomfortable. Be ready to share a small table...

"nice place to find black forest cake, fruit cake, cheese cake in BJ. Authentic rich and wonderful tastes. Pre-ordering cake acceptable however the bakery telephone number is not usually available (keep trying, I dialed max about 40 times to get answered). Expensive but occasionally visit is worthy.","5 из 5 кружков","5A73B986FD72B8F8C3CE87EFE337F79D","Отзыв написан 17 июня 2016"

"I must stop by Kempinski Deli every time go to Lufthansa shopping center.

"One of the many ethnic restaurants in the Kempinski Hotel is a German style Hofbrauhaus. Including a variety of beers including Pauliner. They serve virtually all of the German specialties. And are authentic in flavors. They are on the pricy side. But, if you want authentic flavors, that is the place to get them. Easy access from Subway, less than...

"Here is where you can have great cakes, not to sweet and with quality. Not surprised that they are voted to be the best bakery in Beijing. The service is good too, but there are not so many seats in the busy hours. There are also selling sausages, cheese, ice cream, bread and salad. After 8.30 pm, they half the...

"This would be the perfect place if they made a decent coffee. Meanwhile the art of coffee brewing is no longer a secret, but this deli is not yet mastering this art :-) I still recommend it as an excellent bakery but bring your own coffee.","4 из 5 кружков","7B9358419668E6DE738DBB5F3C3BB464","Отзыв написан 25 сентября 2014"

Lovely beef dishes, and also I tried fried potato in vinegar (cold dish) which I thought was very tasty.

"I had a nice meal of Sichuan food recently at this restaurant. The restaurant is quite modern and has a nice ambiance. The menu was easy to understand for a foreigner like myself, as it had English descriptions and photos! There is a wide variety of food options at very reasonable prices. Definitely worth the visit.","4 из 5 кружков","82692C0464BC0E20FFA01D8C56E025E8","Отзыв написан 12 июля 2016"

"Had great Szechuan food in this popular family restaurant chain for lunch. Good value set lunch menus. Good also for the expats who don't read Chinese - they have menus with pictures in English/Chinese. Try the cold dishes. There is also dishes without the signature chillis - pork ribs, kungpao chicken, and assortment of more ""southern"" dishes.","4 из 5 кружков","7F773752BDC9044AC27F6600C90B65F2","Отзыв написан 14 ноября 2014"

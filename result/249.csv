"Outlet is in Indigo mall. Extensive menu and food was good. If you are not a large group and would also like to try their other dishes, you can order half a (Peking) duck, which is what we did (and we were 3). The half duck order also came with a large helping of duck bouillon (soup) which was tasty....

"Very authentic roast duck, good taste and also they have lots of other local food choices. Just a reminder, the portion of food in Beijing is big, for 2 persons, 2-3 dishes are good enough, or you will definitely waste it.","5 из 5 кружков","56E4E61F2E140315363CD8875DEC2A81","Отзыв написан 21 июля 2015"
"There a variety of reason why I like this restaurant: the service is very good, the decoration is great, you have a strong feeling of Chinese culture with a good taste, you can see the ducks being roasted in the fireplace, and the cuisine is just delicious. This restaurant is typically where I brings friends paying a visit to me...

"We were so excited about going to this restaurant! We were seated by someone who spoke at least a bit of English and the first - and only thing (more on this later) - that was said to us was asking if we wanted Peking Duck. We said yes and her response was that it would take 50 minutes. We...

"I visited Xi He Ya Yuan on two seperate trips to Beijing. I am a big fan of the garlic duck bones and their fried bbq fish. As for the duck, its slightly better than most shops I have been to, but not by a huge margin.","4 из 5 кружков","DB3A8F40D20E107348D30F481678C5ED","Отзыв написан 16 октября 2013"
"I was at this restaurant for a business dinner, so did not choose the dishes. My hosts made a great selection, starting with the traditional Chinese appetizers. The following dishes were very delicious, of course there was a Peking Duck. There were also other dishes, which included steamed fish, a very delicious soup, vegetables etc. Not seeing the menu, I...

"For me, Peking duck is almost the same with Quanjude but with a more reasonable price. If you only want half duck, you will have to wait 50 minutes as they do not want to spoil the other half and would wait for other tables to order it. Other dishes are not that good. I ordered steamed cabbages with garlic,...

"A great choice in this neighborhood on Third Ring Road; on third floor of mega high end shopping mall that's immediately south of the Westin Chaoyang. Decor is very nicely done in imperial style. Staff speaks very little english, but the large pictures in the extensive menu make it really easy to point and order. Great mix of vegetable, meat...

"This restaurant is not close to tourists attractions and not so easy to find but is well worth the detour. As a reference. It is a short walk from the Westin on ring road 3 east. I would qualify the food as Chinese high-end but without the high end prices of places like Lei Garden or Da Dong. The Beijing...

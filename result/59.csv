"All the food is good, comes quickly, and is decently priced. The soup dumplings don't taste as good as they used to (from maybe over a year ago) but are still yummy. I highly recommend the sticky rice (<U+7CEF><U+7C73><U+70E7><U+5356>). This is a good for larger groups. The restaurant is located in a very popular place of the city so traffic...

"We had a big group around 15 and they were very accommodating. Can't beat Din Tai Fung it's consistent all over the world. Been to the one in Taiwan, Singapore, Costa Mesa, Shanghai, and never disappoints. This location was also good as expected. Everyone left satisfied and nothing left on the table.","4 из 5 кружков","434CB2F0CFDB420DF7D338D98467E230","Отзыв написан 11 декабря 2016"

"If you happen to go to Ding Tai Feng, you better be careful not to go there during the dinner rush - it'll be almost impossible to get a seat. The atmosphere there is bustling and cheerful, with bright lights and irresistable aromas. The food served it not only relatively quick, but also delicious - my favourite being the <U+5C0F><U+7B3C><U+5305>(dumplings)....

"This place is filled with chinese people even during unusual times (afternoon). The food is really good- we had mushroom dumplings and mini dumplings with soup. Of the side dishes two of three we ordered were not available, maybe due to the late lunch time (3 pm). The service is unusually cold and almost unfriendly but fast (minus one star)....

"This was my 2nd time to visit this restaurant. I have only given it 4 stars as it lacked a bit of atmosphere and the menus looked a bit tired. I was with a pal (his first time there) and he commented on how great and attentive our waiter was. If you don't eat pork (which we do) I suggest...

They have the best vegetarian dumplings ever served with cucumber and sweet chili, the sauteed vegetables and truffle are also very good.

"Went to this place on a week night around 7pm and was surprised the restaurant was only about half full, where other DTF's I've been to in Taipei and California you would expect at least 1-2 hours wait. Was very disappointed that they do not offer Pot Stickers in this restaurant even though it's in the menu. And no one...

"On the sixth floor of the shopping mall, you could wonder about the quality of such restaurant. Well do not hesitate, it is simply very good. Dumplings, mini shrimps everything we ordered including that mango desert was fantastic. We went from surprise to even better surprise.

We also ordered the local Chinese wine...

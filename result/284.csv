"Мы посетили данный ресторан 27.11.2016 втроем. После частных поездок в Японию стараюсь не ходить в японские рестораны нигде, кроме самой Японии, но ""Надаман"" вчера подарил нам замечательный вечер в тихой уюьной атмосфере, с прекрасным обслуживанием, свежими сашими и внимательным отношением персонала. После ухода с ресторана нам даже перезвонил менеджер и спросил, все ли было в порядке.","5 из 5 кружков","16958A8F6A2CE8AF92A97BADBC7932F6","Отзыв написан 28 ноября 2016"

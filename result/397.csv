"Even though the staff don't speak much English we were served exactly what we wanted and having been sharing Chinese meals for 5 days it was a delight to have a meal all to myself. The food was great and it was nice when the staff tried to give us our tip back but they did deserve it.","5 из 5 кружков","0E580137606D5B3448342A9269CEC87C","Отзыв написан 5 августа 2016"
"Very good service. Was happy to find the place - even when they made mistake in my order - happily they changed it and served us. We felt at ease and the service was very good. Was happy to be there.","4 из 5 кружков","A69B1B1CDF761F1411BE6DA916E295ED","Отзыв написан 4 января 2016"

"Приятное и чистое место. Понравилось, что народу было немного (были в районе 4 часов и видимо основной поток местных схлынул). Хорошая вентиляция, не прокурено. Персонал любезный, с нами изъяснялись на английском. Брали пиццу по-корейски (толстая и острая), неплохой салат нисуаз. К оплате принимают кредитные карты.","3 из 5 кружков","6E7FC833DDD7BA755DF1610495DEE85D","Отзыв написан 30 сентября 2015"

"After a busy day, it was good to see a familiar sign and menu. They do a daily special, but the prices are so reasonable, we ate a la carte. The food is good, the staff try hard to please and we enjoyed our dinner.","4 из 5 кружков","7516214E1FC51E17F25EBA0ADE57BA21","Отзыв написан 30 сентября 2014"

"I was in China for about 6 months for work and this was the only time during those 6 months that I ate anything that wasn't traditional chinese food. It was good and filling. The place wasn't as nice as the cultural eating places around it but we wanted something glutenous and American. Food was cooked how it should have...

"We ate here on our first day in Beijing as it was the closest place to our hotel. Pizza Hut in Asia has a much more varied menu as compared to North America, but you will still find all the regulars here as well.","4 из 5 кружков","2539AFA349C811AB7C776145F527BEBF","Отзыв написан 18 июля 2012"

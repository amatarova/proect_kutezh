"Too corporate, no choice as such, one restaurant was closed. It was OK and the service was good. Just OK...

"Standard spread, overbooked tables, traditional/common dishes, passable service, fusion menu, served soft drinks (instead of juices) ... but all forgiven as they serve truly really nice lamb for a week. :D","4 из 5 кружков","BFB1E73FA026C29B2F439ED2CE002373","Отзыв написан 17 ноября 2016"

"What a fun buffet! All kinds of international fair with Chinese twists. There is a grill that cooks steaks ala minute along with other grilled items. Salad bar complete and fun extras. The chinese station had a noodle station and steamed buns. Everyone can have what they want and not have to fight over what type of cuisine to go...

"Super expensive $43 for the buffet lunch. We ordered off the menu and got wonton soup (no flavor, horrible) for $20, and mushroom soup (also $20) which again had no flavor and the portion size was tiny. Funny story, I arrived at the restaurant before my friends, and the waitress circled the table for 6 minutes waiting for them to...

"The buffet here is quite extensive at the lunch hour, but as I understand, it can be very pricey and probably not worth the price. Lunch was a part of our package and the buffet provided a great choice of food with the quality being very good. Service was very good as well and all choices were kept in good...

"I would recommend Elements for breakfast only. I ate here for all three meals during my week-long stay and would advise to try and seek out other options for lunch and dinner. The breakfast buffet is extensive and has an east meets west feel. You can have dim sum and an omelet with bacon all in one sitting. Lots of...

"I have been in five hotels that proclaim 5 star status in Beijing and the Hilton met my expectations better than the others, as a business traveler. Starting with breakfast buffet that. This is the only hotel I have experienced in Beijing where the hot food is actually hot. I was there both early and late in the morning and...

"Saboten is a casual restaurant serving Japanese cuisine (not Sushi or Sashimi). They have good lunch sets with deep fried meat, curry and so on. Complimentary refill of Miso soup, cabbage and pickles. Try their Tankatsu (pork cutlet). Service is good.","5 из 5 кружков","2E1DD600CE87C17B3C9F62743FDE37E0","Отзыв написан 12 октября 2016"

"Recommended by a friend to try the restaurant's famous deep fried tenderloin, we were very satisfied. The meat is tasty and not greasy at all! The set lunch comes with all you can eat shredded cabbage and rice, in today's standard the price is not expansive. You could have a choice of white rice or whole grain rice. The restaurant...

"This is a large chain from Japan specializing in deep fried pork cutlets and the food here does not disappoint. Had the curry pork cutlet and my gf had the chicken and egg on rice and both were very good. Very nice looking restaurant but twice the price it is in other countries or else I would give it 5...

"Starting with the offerings in the menu I can say that it is very representative of what you would find in Japan itself, but, it is all fried fare. The preparation is authentic, according to my wife, who is Japanese, I am not. We went there for dinner as she is slowly introducing me to Japanese cuisine. We had a...

"Got there on Saturday night at 7:30pm. Had to wait half an hour for a table for 2 - which we did very obligingly. Ended up waiting around 40 minutes, which we also weren't bothered by. Ordered our food and sat there for 45 minutes while nothing - not even the complimentary salad and pickles - arrived, while others who...

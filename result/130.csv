"A perfect place to experience an authentic Hot Pot dinner. It's so authentic, however, that there was no one in the restaurant who spoke English. Fortunately, we were able to phone a Chinese colleague who ordered our meal for us and it was a delight. If you go and don't speak Chinese, make sure to bring a phone with translation...

"We visited the Haidilao restaurant at the top of Wanfujing street. we had a hotpot with half and half. This means a tomato bases soup in whick you cook your food in one boiling cauldron and a second cauldron with enough chilli to heat half of beijing! Be warned but it is good. Staff don't really speak English and it...

"Got here on the evening on July 12th, and had no trouble finding it. Ordered through an iPad and got some mutton and beef, as well as some mushrooms. Tea was good, water was fine, Noodle show was excellent! The restroom was inconveniently located all the way down the mall hallway, but when we got back from the restroom the...

"This restaurant is fantastic! The service is amazing, (they even put on a noodle show) and food is incredibly fast. The sauces are buffet style which is nice because you can make your own mix. The food is fresh. The broth I had was the spicy one and the mushroom one, both great!","5 из 5 кружков","6842490B028CAE3677A2F262DD9F3863","Отзыв написан 7 января 2016"
"We enjoyed a delicious hot pot at Haidilao. Meat and vegetables were of good quality. One problem for visitors who do not speak chinese is ordering as the staff is helpful but does not speak one word english. We had a misuderstanding there and so got a very, very spicey hot pot. It was close to being not edible because...

"I have eaten hot pot probably over 100 times in China and Haidilao still remains by far the best that I have had during the past 4 plus years! I have eaten at least 4 locations in Beijing, 1 in Nanjing and another in Shanghai, all of which delivered the same outstanding quality and service. I have chosen to list...

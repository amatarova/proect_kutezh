"You really can't go wrong with this restaurant, it's located right on the lake and the menu is huge (photos of dishes are on the menu). The restaurant is very large and can accommodate many people. We ordered the Peking Roast Duck- it was cheaper than the fancy restaurants around town and delicious.","4 из 5 кружков","471FBAEF6B19BD62A477337AF5AF2BA3","Отзыв написан 7 июня 2015"
"Kaorouji is a great old restaurant adjoining Houhai Lake. They can arrange a very nice meal on a boat and you can dine in imperial style while gliding around Houhai. If you like, you can hire a musician to go along with you and make the ambiance even better. The lights reflecting in the water are very beautiful. This is...

"Kao Rou Ji is another welcomed affordable restaurant of the locals. The food was very good, especially suitable for friends afterwork, enjoying a couple of beer and casual chatting. Therefore the restaurant was very loud when I was there.

"This restaurant is a great location for an evening visit, just by the lakes, in a lively area with plenty of bars and pubs. The food was well priced and tasty. We particularly enjoyed the spicy lamb ribs, and a large plate of stir-fried vegetables was good value for money. The skewers were also cheap and tasty. Service was quick...

"The restaurant is located next to a small lake that is surrounded by lots of bars and other restaurants. It seems a very hip area and was definitely worth visiting. The restaurant is apparently quite old and well known. It serves Muslim food which seems to mean lobs of barbecued meat. The food was OK but not something really special","4 из 5 кружков","E3333244094A9A2D5331B2C07EDA62C9","Отзыв написан 2 июня 2013"

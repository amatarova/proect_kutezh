"Have eaten here twice and already it is becoming my favorite restaurant in Beijing.

"I love Italian cuisine and never miss a chance to try something Italian. So I did my research and found Bottega. When we arrived at the restaurant there were no vacant tables and we were told that we had to reserve a table (even on a late weekday evening). The stuff was too busy to offer us a menu. Too...

"Bottega, on the opposite side of the Sanlitun Bar Street from the main shopping precinct (down an unlikely looking alley), is a cheerful, casual Italian restaurant with great pizzas and a good wine list.

"Bottega is a wonderful find. Authentic Neapolitan pizza and calzone. The pasta looked great too (although we didn't order any.) It's casual with no airs or graces and like a great trattoria, in the best sense of that term. Busy, noisy and lovely food. A great antidote to the soulless ""Italian"" restaurants in the 5-star hotels.","5 из 5 кружков","D734523B34FE22BB56E535CE2178B435","Отзыв написан 26 января 2017"

"Located near the Taiguli (<U+592A><U+53E4><U+91CC>) shopping complex in Sanlitun, Bottega was, in fact, down a small, sketchy alley.

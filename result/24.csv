"My husband and I had brunch at Capital M on our last day in Beijing after visiting the Temple of Heaven. Every item we had was fantastic and the service was superb.

"What a wonderful place. Great location overlooking the square. Romantic and had fireplaces throughout the restaurant. A bit disappointed they allowed a couple wearing sweat pants on a celebratory night like New Year's Eve, I think when a dress code is stated even on the front door that it's ok to say no, But, that's fine. Wouldn't stop us from...

"Visited Capital M for a dinner with business associates. The restaurant serves modern western cuisine. We had a selection of starters and mains which were all excellent. The lamb in particular was fantastic. If you love M on The Bund in Shanghai you will find its sister in Beijing is just as good. Mains were priced in the 200-400 rmb...

"This was my second visit to Capital M in recent months and it by far surpassed the first (which was pretty good anyway!).
